Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.Noncommutative algebraic geometry:  High credibility of text: Noncommutative algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, and more specifically a direction in noncommutative geometry, that studies the geometric properties of formal duals of non-commutative algebraic objects such as rings as well as geometric objects derived from them (e.g. by gluing along localizations or taking noncommutative stack quotients). Middle credibility of text:  For example, noncommutative algebraic geometry is supposed to extend a notion of an algebraic scheme by suitable gluing of spectra of noncommutative rings; depending on how literally and how generally this aim (and a notion of spectrum) is understood in noncommutative setting, this has been achieved in various level of success. Middle credibility of text:  The noncommutative ring generalizes here a commutative ring of regular functions on a commutative scheme. Middle credibility of text:  Functions on usual spaces in the traditional (commutative) algebraic geometry multiply by points; as the values of these functions commute, the functions also commute: \"a\" times \"b\" equals \"b\" times \"a\". Middle credibility of text:  It is remarkable that viewing noncommutative associative algebras as algebras of functions on \"noncommutative\" would-be space is a far-reaching geometric intuition, though it formally looks like a fallacy.Éléments de géométrie algébrique:  High credibility of text: The Éléments de géométrie algébrique (\"Elements of Algebraic Geometry\") by Alexander Grothendieck (assisted by Jean Dieudonné), or EGA for short, is a rigorous treatise, in French, on algebraic geometry that was published (in eight parts or fascicles) from 1960 through 1967 by the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques. Middle credibility of text:  In it, Grothendieck established systematic foundations of algebraic geometry, building upon the concept of schemes, which he defined. Middle credibility of text:  The work is now considered the foundation stone and basic reference of modern algebraic geometry.Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry:  High credibility of text: In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are two closely related subjects. High credibility of text:  While algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties, analytic geometry deals with complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. High credibility of text:  The deep relation between these subjects has numerous applications in which algebraic techniques are applied to analytic spaces and analytic techniques to algebraic varieties.Universal algebraic geometry:  High credibility of text: In universal algebraic geometry, algebraic geometry is generalized from the geometry of rings to geometry of arbitrary varieties of algebras, so that every \"variety of algebra\" has its own algebraic geometry. High credibility of text:  The two terms algebraic variety and \"variety of algebra\" should not be confused.Derived algebraic geometry:  High credibility of text: Derived algebraic geometry (also called spectral algebraic geometry) is a branch of mathematics that generalizes algebraic geometry to a situation where commutative rings, which provide a local chart, are replaced by ring spectra in algebraic topology, whose higher homotopy accounts for the non-discreteness (e.g., Tor) of the structure sheaf. High credibility of text:  Grothendieck's scheme theory allows the structure sheaf to carry nilpotent elements. Derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this, and provides natural settings for intersection theory (or motivic homotopy theory) of singular algebraic varieties and cotangent complexes in deformation theory (cf. F. Francis)."

High credibility of text:  Prior to 2000, when the AL and NL were dissolved as separate entities and merged into the organization called Major League Baseball, the American League was one of the two leagues that made up major league baseball. High credibility of text:  The American League has one notable difference over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule. High credibility of text:  Originally a minor league known as the Western League, the league later developed into a major league after the American Association disbanded. Middle credibility of text:  Johnson led the Western League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League. Middle credibility of text:  In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. High credibility of text:  Under the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to hit.Designated hitter:  High credibility of text: In baseball, the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11, adopted by the American League in 1973. High credibility of text:  The rule allows teams to have one player, known as the designated hitter (abbreviated DH), to bat in place of the pitcher. High credibility of text:  Since 1973, most collegiate, amateur, and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant. High credibility of text:  MLB's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.Bill Pounds:  High credibility of text: Jeared Wells \"Bill\" Pounds (March 11, 1878 – July 7, 1936) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. Low credibility of text:  He died in 1936 in the city of his birth, aged 58. Middle credibility of text:  He appeared in just two major league games, one each for Cleveland and Brooklyn in 1903, but the only surviving images of him in a major league uniform show him with the New York Highlanders. Middle credibility of text:  Bill Pounds was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a long career as a minor league pitcher. Low credibility of text:  His professional career began in 1899 when he pitched for both Binghamton and Paterson. Low credibility of text:  Early in the 21st century, the photographic archives of the Chicago Daily News were posted online. Low credibility of text:  Before the end of the month, without having appeared in a game for New York, Pounds was sent back to Cleveland, apparently because he could not come to terms on a contract. Middle credibility of text:  After a year out of organized baseball, he played in 1901 and 1902 for two Ilion and Utica in the New York State League. Low credibility of text:  He perspired so much that…a miniature lake (formed) around the slab.” Low credibility of text:  Pounds was in uniform with the team when the Highlanders visited Chicago for a series May 20–22. Low credibility of text:  On May 18 he was released by Cleveland and was signed shortly thereafter by the New York Highlanders. Middle credibility of text:  After reportedly signing a contract to return to Utica for 1903, he was signed by Cleveland in the American League and was on their Opening Day roster. Middle credibility of text:  A photographer from the Chicago Daily News was taking pictures of the players on the teams visiting both the American League and National League ballparks, and during this visit Pounds had his image preserved for posterity. Low credibility of text:  Pounds was brought in to pitch on May 2 in the fourth inning in Chicago when the White Stockings had opened up a big lead; he gave up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in the 16-6 loss. Low credibility of text:  He has not the best control in the world.” Low credibility of text:  Late in the 1903 season, his contract was purchased by Denver, but it is unclear whether he actually played in Colorado. Low credibility of text:  On July 3, his contract was transferred to Baltimore of the Eastern League, along with that of Hughie Jennings and three other Dodgers. Low credibility of text:  With Pittsburg ahead 12-0 after three innings, Pounds was sent in to pitch. High credibility of text:  Pounds would never appear in another major league game; though his pitching record was unimpressive, he finished with a lifetime batting record of three hits in five at-bats. Low credibility of text:  Although his teammates’ photographs were easily identified, the image of Pounds remained unidentified, or occasionally misidentified as Doc Adkins, for at least a decade. Middle credibility of text:  On June 4 he was signed by Brooklyn of the National League, but he did not appear in a game until June 30. Middle credibility of text:  For the remainder of his minor-league career, from 1904 through 1911, he pitched for teams within a couple of hundred miles of his birth—four teams in the New York State League and two in the Tri-State League. Middle credibility of text:  He allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings on eight hits and two walks in the 17-8 loss, and gave up a long home run to Honus Wagner. Low credibility of text:  A few years after his career had ended, the Utica Observer described him in this way: “Bill Pounds was the champion sweater of the league. Middle credibility of text:  In the off-seasons he would sometimes pitch for the Paterson Elks team, and he continued to pitch for them after his minor-league career had ended. Low credibility of text:  According to The Sporting Life, “Pounds has speed and a rather good assortment of curves.Paixiao:  Low credibility of text: The paixiao (traditional: 排簫; simplified: 排箫; pinyin: \"páixiāo\"; also pái xiāo, pai-hsiao, pronounced ] ) is an ancient Chinese wind instrument, a form of Pan flute. Low credibility of text:  A major difference between the Chinese Paixiao and the panpipes used in European and South American traditions, is that at the top of the Chinese instrument the pipe holes are each cut angled or with notches. Middle credibility of text:  This allows for bending the pitch in similar capacity to the dongxiao down a minor second. Low credibility of text:  This allows Chinese paixiao to be fully chromatic without loss in timbre, even though the included pipes are tuned diatonically.List of Major League Baseball batting champions:  High credibility of text: In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat. High credibility of text:  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). Middle credibility of text:  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title. High credibility of text:  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\". Middle credibility of text:  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year. High credibility of text:  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. Middle credibility of text:  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. High credibility of text:  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.List of Houston Astros no-hitters:  Low credibility of text: The Houston Astros (formerly known as the \"Houston Colt .45s\" from 1962–64) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Houston, Texas. Low credibility of text:  No perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been thrown in Astros history. Middle credibility of text:  Formed in 1962, they play in the American League West division (formerly in the National League Central division until 2012). Low credibility of text:  Pitchers for the Astros have thrown eleven no-hitters in franchise history. Middle credibility of text:  A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. High credibility of text:  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings”. High credibility of text:  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. Middle credibility of text:  As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.”List of Chicago White Sox no-hitters:  Low credibility of text: The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Chicago. Low credibility of text:  They play in the American League Central division. Low credibility of text:  Pitchers for the White Sox have thrown eighteen no-hitters in franchise history. Middle credibility of text:  These feats were achieved by Charlie Robertson in 1922, which was the first perfect game on the road in MLB history, Mark Buehrle in 2009, and Philip Humber in 2012. High credibility of text:  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings. High credibility of text:  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. Middle credibility of text:  In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher’s interference.” Low credibility of text:  Three perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been pitched in White Sox history, which equals the New York Yankees for the most perfect games pitched by any MLB franchise. Middle credibility of text:  A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. Middle credibility of text:  As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.”List of Milwaukee Brewers no-hitters:  Low credibility of text: The Milwaukee Brewers (formerly known as the \"Seattle Pilots\" in 1969) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Middle credibility of text:  Formed in 1969, they play in the National League Central division (formerly in the American League Central Division until 1997). Low credibility of text:  Juan Nieves threw the only no-hitter in franchise history on April 15, 1987. Middle credibility of text:  As defined by Major League Baseball, \"in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.\" High credibility of text:  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only \"when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings\". Middle credibility of text:  A no-hitter is rare enough that a Major League Baseball team, the San Diego Padres, has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. High credibility of text:  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. Low credibility of text:  A perfect game, a special subcategory of no-hitter, has yet to be thrown in Brewers history.Defensive substitution:  High credibility of text: A defensive substitution in the game of baseball occurs when a currently non-playing player is placed into the field in place of another player, typically due either to injury or the appearance of a pinch hitter. High credibility of text:  In the American League, a pinch hitter is usually substituted for the position player in whose place he batted (although another common substitution is pinch-hitting a utility infielder for a second baseman and subsequently switching him for the shortstop in the field while moving the shortstop over to the now-vacant second base position). High credibility of text:  In the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, pinch hitters sometimes bat for pitchers. However, another common pitcher-substitution strategy in the NL is the double switch, in which a pitching change is coupled with a pinch-hitter who is also defensively substituted for a second player.1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game:  High credibility of text: The 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 57th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. Middle credibility of text:  The game was held on July 15, 1986, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, the home of the Houston Astros of the National League. High credibility of text:  The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3-2 and ended a streak where the NL won 13 of the last 14 games. High credibility of text:  Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens was named the Most Valuable Player."

        "value": "Question: What type of vegetation does Tabernaemontana and Crinum have in common?\nDesert dry wash:  Low credibility of text:  They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding. Middle credibility of text: Desert dry wash is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events. Low credibility of text:  Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event. Low credibility of text:  Desert dry wash is contrasted with desert riparian vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface. Low credibility of text:  Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event. High credibility of text:  Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (\"Psorothamnus spinosus\"), desert willow (\"Chilopsis linearis\"), catclaw (\"Senegalia greggii\"), cheesebush (\"Ambrosia salsola\"), and waterweed (\"Baccharis sergiloides\").Caatinga:  High credibility of text: Caatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy). Low credibility of text:  The name \"Caatinga\" is a Tupi word meaning \"white forest\" or \"white vegetation\" (\"caa\" = forest, vegetation, \"tinga\" = white). Middle credibility of text:  It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.Wildfire:  Low credibility of text: A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Low credibility of text:  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Low credibility of text:  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Low credibility of text:  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions. Low credibility of text:  Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.Desert riparian:  Middle credibility of text: Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year. Middle credibility of text:  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year. Low credibility of text:  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration. Low credibility of text:  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas. Low credibility of text:  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows. Low credibility of text:  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow. High credibility of text:  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\"). Low credibility of text:  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.Vegetation and slope stability:  Middle credibility of text: Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope. Low credibility of text:  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots. Middle credibility of text:  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope. Middle credibility of text:  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.Vegetation classification:  Middle credibility of text: Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface. Middle credibility of text:  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Middle credibility of text:  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. Middle credibility of text:  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Middle credibility of text:  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Middle credibility of text:  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.Dinaric calcareous block fir forest:  Middle credibility of text: The Dinaric calcareous silver fir forests are an endemic vegetation type of the littoral Dinaric Alps, located in southeastern Europe.

Low credibility of text:  This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills. High credibility of text:  It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1959, and then was expanded upon in 1967. Low credibility of text:  Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game. Low credibility of text:  At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching. Low credibility of text:  An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer.Total institution:  Low credibility of text: A total institution is a place of work and residence where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life. High credibility of text:  The concept is mostly associated with the work of sociologist Erving Goffman.Identity Performance:  Low credibility of text: In everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance. Low credibility of text:  We can then alter our performance accordingly. Low credibility of text:  In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves. Low credibility of text:  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions. Low credibility of text:  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior. Low credibility of text:  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Low credibility of text:  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them. Low credibility of text:  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. Low credibility of text:  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior. High credibility of text:  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management. Middle credibility of text:  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.Identity management theory:  Low credibility of text: Identity management theory (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an intercultural communication theory from the 1990s. High credibility of text:  It was developed by William R. Cupach and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's \"Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior\" (1967).

Middle credibility of text:  He estimated that \"no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.\" Middle credibility of text:  His students were required to read widely, sources not only in communication but also anthropology and linguistics. High credibility of text:  Stated more broadly, he argued that \"words are not the only containers of social knowledge.\" Middle credibility of text:  Birdwhistell had at least as much impact on the study of language and social interaction generally as just nonverbal communication because he was interested in the study of communication more broadly than is often recognized. Middle credibility of text:  He proposed other technical terms, including kineme, and many others less frequently used today. High credibility of text:  Collaborations with others, including initially Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and later, Erving Goffman and Dell Hymes had huge influence on his work.

High credibility of text:  For example, the book he is best known for, \"Kinesics and Context\", \"would not have appeared if it had not been envisaged by Erving Goffman\" and he explicitly stated \"the paramount and sustaining influence upon my work has been that of anthropological linguistics\", a tradition most directly represented at the University of Pennsylvania by Hymes.Politeness theory:  Middle credibility of text: Politeness theory accounts for the redressing of affronts to a person's 'face' by face-threatening acts.

High credibility of text:  Erving Goffman would then go on to introduce the concept into academia through his theories of 'face' and 'facework'. Middle credibility of text:  The concept of face was derived from Chinese into English in the 19th century. Middle credibility of text:  In 1987, Brown and Levinson proposed that politeness was a universal concept, which has created controversy within academia. Middle credibility of text:  Another definition is \"a battery of social skills whose goal is to ensure everyone feels affirmed in a social interaction\". Middle credibility of text:  Politeness is the expression of the speakers' intention to mitigate face threats carried by certain face threatening acts toward the listener. Middle credibility of text:  Although politeness has been studied in a variety of cultures for many years, Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson's politeness theory has become very influential.Dramaturgy (sociology):  Middle credibility of text: Dramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life. High credibility of text:  The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\". High credibility of text:  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare. High credibility of text:  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor. High credibility of text:  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life:  High credibility of text: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction. High credibility of text:  Originally published in Scotland in 1956 and in the United States in 1959, it is Goffman’s first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association’s MacIver award in 1961.Goffman (disambiguation):  High credibility of text: Erving Goffman (1922–1982) was a Canadian sociologist"
