                "value": "Question:Out of two American colonies that had a series of skirmishes and raids between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border, which British proprietary colony became a royal colony on the northeast coast of North America?\nDocs:Province of New York:The Province of New York (1664–1776) was a British proprietary colony and later royal colony on the northeast coast of North America.  As one of the Thirteen Colonies, New York achieved independence and worked with the others to found the United States.\nNew York – New Jersey Line War:The New York – New Jersey Line War (also known as the N.J. Line War) refers to a series of skirmishes and raids that took place for over half a century between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border between two American colonies, the Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey.\nProprietary colony:A proprietary colony was a type of British colony mostly in North America and the Caribbean in the 17th century.  In the British Empire, all land belonged to the ruler, and it was his prerogative to divide.  Therefore, all colonial properties were partitioned by royal charter into one of four types: proprietary, royal, joint stock, or covenant.  King Charles II used the proprietary solution to reward allies and focus his own attention on Britain itself.  He offered his friends colonial charters which facilitated private investment and colonial self-government.  The charters made the proprietor the effective ruler, albeit one ultimately responsible to English law and the king.  Charles II gave New Netherland to his younger brother The Duke of York, who named it New York.  He gave an area to William Penn who named it Pennsylvania.\nProvince of New Jersey:The Province of New Jersey was one of the Middle Colonies of Colonial America and became the U.S. state of New Jersey in 1776.  The province had originally been settled by Europeans as part of New Netherland, but came under English rule after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, becoming a proprietary colony.  The English then renamed the province after the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel.  The Dutch Republic reasserted control for a brief period in 1673–1674.  After that it consisted of two political divisions, East Jersey and West Jersey, until they were united as a royal colony in 1702.  The original boundaries of the province were slightly larger than the current state, extending into a part of the present state of New York, until the border was finalized in 1773.\nCharter colony:Charter colony is one of three classes of colonial government established in the 17th century English colonies in North America, the other classes being proprietary colony and royal colony.  The colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Bay were charter colonies.  In a charter colony, Britain granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed.  The charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut granted the colonists significantly more political liberty than other colonies.  Rhode Island and Connecticut continued to use their colonial charters as their State constitutions after the American Revolution.\nCanada under British rule:Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\nProvince of Pennsylvania:The Province of Pennsylvania, also known as the Pennsylvania Colony, was founded in English North America by William Penn on March 4, 1681 as dictated in a royal charter granted by King Charles II.  The name Pennsylvania, which translates roughly as \"Penn's Woods\", was created by combining the Penn surname (in honor of William's father, Admiral Sir William Penn) with the Latin word \"sylvania\", meaning \"forest land.\"  The Province of Pennsylvania was one of the two major Restoration colonies, the other being the Province of Carolina.  The proprietary colony's charter remained in the hands of the Penn family until the American Revolution, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was created and became one of the original thirteen states.\nHistory of the New Jersey State Constitution:Originally, the state of New Jersey was a single British colony, the Province of New Jersey.  After the English Civil War, Charles II assigned New Jersey as a proprietary colony to be held jointly by Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton.  Eventually, the collection of land fees, or quit-rents, from colonists proved inadequate for colonial profitability.  Sir George Carteret sold his share of the colony to the Quakers in 1673.  Following the sale, the land was divided into East and West Jersey.  In 1681, West Jersey adopted a constitution.  In 1683, East Jersey adopted one as well.  In 1702, the colonies were united again under Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and adopted a constitution in 1776.\nStamp Act Congress:Stamp Act Congress: The Stamp Act Congress or First Congress of the American Colonies was a meeting held between October 7 and 25, 1765 in New York City, consisting of representatives from some of the British colonies in North America; it was the first gathering of elected representatives from several of the American colonies to devise a unified protest against new British taxation.  Parliament had passed the Stamp Act, which required the use of specially stamped paper for legal documents, playing cards, calendars, newspapers and dice for virtually all business in the colonies, and was going into effect on November 1.\nStamp Act 1765:The Stamp Act of 1765 (short title \"Duties in American Colonies Act 1765\"; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that imposed a direct tax on the colonies of British America and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.  Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.  Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.  The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War and its North American theater of the French and Indian War.  The Americans said that there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies on the continent, and the Americans had always protected themselves against Indians.  They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.\n\nAnswer:"

The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate.  In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as \"a true Texas breed\".  In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as \"the official State Dog Breed of Texas\".  As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas.  However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.\nNorrbottenspets:The Norrbottenspets is a breed of dog of the spitz type.  It is an ancient breed whose original purpose was a farm and hunting dog but has recently become more popular as a companion dog.  The Norrbottenspets is used to hunt wood grouse, black grouse, capercaillie and hazel grouse, but also fox, marten and raccoon.  Some individuals are also effective with mammals as large as moose and grizzly bear.  Norrbottenspets was formerly used in hunting squirrels, when squirrel fur was valuable in the beginning of the 20th century and earlier.\nKerry Blue Terrier:The Kerry Blue Terrier (also known as the Irish Blue Terrier) () is a breed of dog.  Originally bred to control \"vermin\" including rats, rabbits, badgers, foxes, otters and hares, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep, and as a guard dog.  Today the Kerry has spread around the world as a companion and working dog.  Despite a Kerry Blue winning Crufts (the most important UK dog show) in 2000, it remains an \"unfashionable\" breed, and is distinctly uncommon; however, it not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\nSwedish Vallhund:The Swedish Vallhund, also known as the \"Västgötaspets\" and Swedish cow dog, is a breed of dog native to Sweden.  The breed's name, \"Vallhund\", when translated into English, means herding dog, as the Swedish Vallhund was originally bred as a drover and herder of cows over 1,000 years ago.  In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end.  In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as \"the Västgötaspets\" for Västergötland, the province in which their revival took place.  Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.\nAustralian Cattle Dog:Australian Cattle Dog: The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain.  This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms.  It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog.  It should not be confused with the Australian Shepherd, a similarly named but totally different breed.\nUncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials:Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials is an annual Hog Dog Baying Event held in the third weekend of March in Winnfield, Winn Parish, Louisiana at the Winn Parish Fair Grounds involving boars and various breeds of bay dogs, including Catahoula Leopard Dogs, Blackmouth Cur, Blue Lacy, and others.\nWestern crowned pigeon:The western crowned pigeon, also known as the common crowned pigeon or blue crowned pigeon (\"Goura cristata\") is a large, blue-grey pigeon with blue lacy crests over the head and dark blue mask feathers around its eyes.

It has a bluish-grey plumage with elaborate blue lacy crests, red iris and very deep maroon breast.  Both sexes have a similar appearance.  It is on average 70 cm (28 in) long and weighs 2,250 grams (5 lbs).\nPolish Helmet:The Polish Helmet or Polish Krymka Tumbler (Polish: \"krymka polska\" ) is a breed of fancy pigeon, specifically a type of Helmet pigeon, that has been developed over many years of selective breeding.  It is distinctive on account of its \"Muffs\" (large foot feathers), and is colored only on the top half of its head (the \"helmet\") and on its tail.  It is thought to be related to the European and American pigeons, though it remains unknown as to what came first or how they spread and adapted all over the world.\nLebanon at the 1959 Mediterranean Games:Lebanon hosted the 3rd Mediterranean Games in Camille Chamoun sports city in Beirut.  The event took place from 11 to 23 October 1959.  11 nations were represented by a total of 792 athletes, all males, competing in 17 sports of 106 events.  France came first: its 66 athletes won 69 medals (26 gold), while the host country, Lebanon, with the most athletes (180), came 8th with 30 medals (only 3 golds).

The music was jointly composed by Eric Bloom, lead singer of Blue Öyster Cult, and bass-player John Trivers.  The song was featured in the Blue Öyster Cult album \"Cultösaurus Erectus.\"  When Bloom was asked how he got in touch with Moorcock for the song he claims, \"I went out of my way to send him a Fan Boy letter.

The player-character or objects in the game world may move through portals, their momentum conserved.  This allows complex \"flinging\" maneuvers to be used to cross wide gaps or perform other feats to reach the exit for each test chamber.

It was established on 9 August 1941, mostly for Serb and Jewish children and women.  The camp was established and operated by Ustaše, with 16 of its guards being members of the local Volksdeutsche community.

When the Axis powers occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Šakić, aged 19, joined the administration in Jasenovac.  He became the camp's assistant commander the following year, and married Nada Luburić, the half-sister of concentration camp commander Vjekoslav \"Maks\" Luburić, in 1943.  This marriage, as well as his fanatic support for Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić, led to Šakić's appointment as commander of Jasenovac in April 1944.

On 27 March 1944, Zoddel and 1,000 other prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora arrived at Bergen-Belsen.  By January 1945, Zoddel had risen in the ranks to a camp division.  Two days after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by the British army on 15 April 1945, Zoddel killed a female detainee, a crime for which he was sentenced to death by a British military court in Celle on 31 August 1945.

Bardzka), opposite the cemetery of the Holy Ghost.  The camp, intended for the opponents of Nazism, was established at a place of the former POW camp for French prisoners of World War I, converted and utilized by the fertilizer factory.  The new camp was founded on the initiative of the commander of SA in Silesia, \"SA-Obergruppenführer\" Edmund Heines, on 12 March 1933, and liquidated on 10 August 1933 with all prisoners transported to a larger concentration camp at Osnabrück.\nEsterwegen concentration camp:The Esterwegen concentration camp near Esterwegen was an early Nazi concentration camp within a series of camps first established in the Emsland district of Germany.

The camp was closed in summer of 1936.  Until 1945 the camp was used as a prison camp.  Political prisoners and so called \"Nacht und Nebel\"-prisoners were also held here.

Situated in a cold climate, it was notorious for its hard work regime, sparse rations, and inadequate shelter.  It is estimated that some 800 prisoners passed through the camp, and when liberated about 550 were incarcerated.\nMoody (surname):Moody is an English surname.  It ranks in the top 200 most common surnames in English speaking nations.  The earliest known example dates from the 12th century in a Devonshire early English charter where the name Alwine 'Modig' is mentioned.  Recent census research suggests that the surname has been most consistently populous in Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire and also in areas of northeast England.  There is also a high incidence of the similar-sounding surname 'Moodie' in Scotland, in particular Orkney, although this variant, ending \"ie\", has possible Norse/Celtic origins.  The surname Moody was also carried to areas of Ireland settled by the early English.  Although the most intensive areas of occurrence match areas of dense Anglo-Saxon habitation post 1066, it is difficult to determine if the name is Anglo-Saxon or Nordic/Viking in origin, since all Germanic countries used the word 'Modig' or 'Mutig' to indicate someone who was bold, impetuous or brave.  Surnames were increasingly given through the early Middle Ages to assist taxation and an increasing incidence of the name can be followed in such documents as the Hundred Rolls, early English charters and general medieval assizes associated with such actions as baronial struggles, Crusades or Angevin campaigns in France.\n\nAnswer:"

She became devastated when her mother died of cancer, and when Cobalt died, she almost gave up riding.  But her father, U.S. Marine Colonel Mitch Hanson, reminded Carole that her mother would have wanted her to follow her passion.  With money left by her mother, she bought a buckskin gelding, Starlight.  Carole knows her future lies with horses, but there are many paths to follow and she does not know which road to take.  Her grades are high enough for her to become a veterinarian but she would also love to breed and train Thoroughbreds.  She would not mind being a professional steeplechase jockey, or maybe traveling the world teaching dressage clinics.  Whatever career she chooses, her most immediate goal is to be the very best rider she can be.  Carole has little time for boys; therefore, she has never understood why anyone would prefer the company of a boy to that of a horse.  This is when the pressures of family, friends, school and competition cannot touch her.  Anyone who catches a glimpse of horse and rider moving as one along the lush creek cannot help but be in awe.  Like the other Saddle Club girls, Carole is becoming a young woman.  In \"Moving On, Part 1\", Carole's dad got re-deployed and she almost left Pine Hollow, The Saddle Club, and Starlight behind forever when it was decided that she'd live with her Aunt Penny.  Thanks to Mrs. Reg, however, Carole becomes the first live in boarder at Pine Hollow Stables as of \"Moving On, Part 2\" which allowed her to stay at Pine Hollow, continue to be in The Saddle Club, and keep Starlight.  Carole has never forgiven Veronica for killing Cobalt.  In \"Itchy\", Carole thought that she was allergic to horses, but after a visit to the doctor it was revealed that she is allergic to camels as the saddle blanket that her father sent her is made out of camel hair.  When Carole suggests naming Samson after \"Samson and Delilah\", it was a hinted indication that Carole is a Christian.  Whenever Carole's sad, to cheer herself up she'll ride Starlight or play her guitar.  Carole is focused, determined, stubborn, and passionate just like her mother was.

                "value": "Question:The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by a mathematician of what nationality?\nDocs:Glossary of classical algebraic geometry:The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically during the twentieth century, with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by David Hilbert and the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the beginning of the century, and later formalized by André Weil, Serre and Grothendieck.  Much of the classical terminology, mainly based on case study, was simply abandoned, with the result that books and papers written before this time can be hard to read.  This article lists some of this classical terminology, and describes some of the changes in conventions.\nAlgebraic geometry and analytic geometry:In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are two closely related subjects.  While algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties, analytic geometry deals with complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables.  The deep relation between these subjects has numerous applications in which algebraic techniques are applied to analytic spaces and analytic techniques to algebraic varieties.\nDerived algebraic geometry:Derived algebraic geometry (also called spectral algebraic geometry) is a branch of mathematics that generalizes algebraic geometry to a situation where commutative rings, which provide a local chart, are replaced by ring spectra in algebraic topology, whose higher homotopy accounts for the non-discreteness (e.g., Tor) of the structure sheaf.  Grothendieck's scheme theory allows the structure sheaf to carry nilpotent elements. Derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this, and provides natural settings for intersection theory (or motivic homotopy theory) of singular algebraic varieties and cotangent complexes in deformation theory (cf. F. Francis).\nUniversal algebraic geometry:In universal algebraic geometry, algebraic geometry is generalized from the geometry of rings to geometry of arbitrary varieties of algebras, so that every \"variety of algebra\" has its own algebraic geometry.  The two terms algebraic variety and \"variety of algebra\" should not be confused.\nNoncommutative algebraic geometry:Noncommutative algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, and more specifically a direction in noncommutative geometry, that studies the geometric properties of formal duals of non-commutative algebraic objects such as rings as well as geometric objects derived from them (e.g. by gluing along localizations or taking noncommutative stack quotients).  For example, noncommutative algebraic geometry is supposed to extend a notion of an algebraic scheme by suitable gluing of spectra of noncommutative rings; depending on how literally and how generally this aim (and a notion of spectrum) is understood in noncommutative setting, this has been achieved in various level of success.  The noncommutative ring generalizes here a commutative ring of regular functions on a commutative scheme.  Functions on usual spaces in the traditional (commutative) algebraic geometry multiply by points; as the values of these functions commute, the functions also commute: \"a\" times \"b\" equals \"b\" times \"a\".  It is remarkable that viewing noncommutative associative algebras as algebras of functions on \"noncommutative\" would-be space is a far-reaching geometric intuition, though it formally looks like a fallacy.\nÉléments de géométrie algébrique:The Éléments de géométrie algébrique (\"Elements of Algebraic Geometry\") by Alexander Grothendieck (assisted by Jean Dieudonné), or EGA for short, is a rigorous treatise, in French, on algebraic geometry that was published (in eight parts or fascicles) from 1960 through 1967 by the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques.  In it, Grothendieck established systematic foundations of algebraic geometry, building upon the concept of schemes, which he defined.  The work is now considered the foundation stone and basic reference of modern algebraic geometry.\nMotivic integration:Motivic integration is a notion in algebraic geometry that was introduced by Maxim Kontsevich in 1995 and was developed by Jan Denef and François Loeser.  Since its introduction it has proved to be quite useful in various branches of algebraic geometry, most notably birational geometry and singularity theory.  Roughly speaking, motivic integration assigns to subsets of the arc space of an algebraic geometry, a volume living in the Grothendieck ring of algebraic varieties.  The naming 'motivic' mirrors the fact that unlike ordinary integration, for which the values are real numbers, in motivic integration the values are geometric in nature.\nNicolae Popescu:Nicolae Popescu, Ph.D., D.Phil.  (] ; 22 September 1937 – 29 July 2010) was a Romanian mathematician and Emeritus Professor.  Popescu was elected a Member of the Romanian Academy in 1992.  He is best known for his contributions to Algebra and the theory of Abelian categories.  Since 1964 and until 2007 he collaborated on the characterization of abelian categories with the well-known French mathematician Pierre Gabriel.  His areas of expertise were: Category theory, Abelian categories with Applications to Rings and Modules, adjoint functors, limits/colimits, Theory of Sheaves, Theory of Rings, Fields and Polynomials, and Valuation Theory; he also had interests and published in the following areas: Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra, K-Theory, Class-Field theory, and Algebraic Function Theory.  He published between 1962 and 2008 more than 102 papers in peer-reviewed, mathematics journals, several monographs on the theory of sheaves, and also six books on abelian category theory and abstract algebra.  In a Grothendieck-like, energetic style, he initiated and provided scientific leadership to several seminars on category theory, sheaves and abstract algebra which resulted in a continuous stream of high-quality mathematical publications in international, peer-reviewed mathematics journals by several members participating in his Seminar series.  His book \"Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules\" continues to provide valuable information to mathematicians around the world.  His latest contributions have also branched into valuation and number theory.  He has published over 110 original, peer-reviewed articles in mathematics, mostly in category theory, algebraic geometry, and Galois and number theory.\nAbelian variety:In mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry, complex analysis and number theory, an abelian variety is a projective algebraic variety that is also an algebraic group, i.e., has a group law that can be defined by regular functions. Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.\nFunction field of an algebraic variety:Function field of an algebraic variety: In algebraic geometry, the function field of an algebraic variety \"V\" consists of objects which are interpreted as rational functions on \"V\".  In classical algebraic geometry they are ratios of polynomials; in complex algebraic geometry these are meromorphic functions and their higher-dimensional analogues; in modern algebraic geometry they are elements of some quotient ring's field of fractions.\n\nAnswer:"

New manager Neil Lennon made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010-11 season.  He sold Aiden McGeady for a then Scottish record £9.5 million along with captain Stephen McManus and fan favourite Artur Boruc.  13 other players also left the club, this gave Lennon enough funds to re-build for the new season.  He looked to sign talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players, from smaller leagues around the world.  This paid off with players such as Gary Hooper, Beram Kayal and Emilio Izaguirre all having excellent seasons and earning many plaudits.  Lennon also signed several experienced players on free transfers.  Charlie Mulgrew, Joe Ledley, and Daniel Majstorović all went into the first team.  In addition to these Lennon also signed five other players, including Fraser Forster on loan from Newcastle who became first choice 'keeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets.\n2010–11 Real Valladolid season:The 2010–11 Spanish football season is Real Valladolid's first season in the second level in Spanish football since the historical 2006–07 season, in which the team promoted to La Liga with 88 points.  After the salvation attempt of the previous season, Javier Clemente was sacked on 23 June 2010, before the pre-season.  Antonio Gómez, Rafael Benítez's former assistant and the former coach of Albacete B, was the new team manager for the 2010–11 season but he was sacked on 29 November 2010 after the defeat against Cartagena in Nuevo José Zorrilla.  Javier Torres Gómez was the provisional manager between 29 November and 5 December, earning a point at Barcelona Atlètic's Mini Estadi.  After that, Abel Resino was named new team manager in the afternoon of 5 December.\n2015 Buffalo Bills season:The 2015 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise’s 56th overall season as a football team, 46th in the National Football League, third under leadership of general manager Doug Whaley and first under new head coach Rex Ryan, who signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract on January 12, 2015 after having previously spent the past six seasons coaching the division-rival New York Jets, leading them to two straight AFC Championship games in 2009 and 2010, becoming the franchise’s 18th head coach and the fifth in the past seven years in the process.  Ryan replaced Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract on December 31, 2014 to take advantage of a contract loophole, fearing the Pegulas were going to fire him, hence the reason the Bills entered the 2015 season looking for a new head coach.  Despite the bold prediction made by Ryan at his introductory press conference, where he stated, “I’m not going to let our fans down.  I am not going to do that.  I know it’s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs.  Well, get ready, man, we’re going.  We are going,” the Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team’s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015.  It was also the first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (whom also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson in March at the age of 95.  The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.\nPieter Huistra:Pieter Huistra: Pieter Egge Huistra (] , born 18 January 1967) is a Dutch football coach and former winger, who currently serves as assistant manager at Pakhtakor Tashkent FK in Uzbekistan.  Huistra played for the Scottish Premier Division club Rangers from 1990-95.  He left there to play for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in the J. League.  In 2001, he began coaching as the Head Coach for Jong Groningen.  He was with them for four years before being named assistant coach of Aad de Mos at Vitesse.  He then became an assistant coach with AFC Ajax and was named as their Head Coach on April 24, 2009.  He was then the head coach of FC Groningen for the 2010–11 season.  On May 30, 2012 he then became the head coach of the Eerste Divisie club De Graafschap.  Finally, on December 3, 2014 he was appointed as the Technical Director of the Indonesia national football team.\n2007 Miami Dolphins season:The 2007 Miami Dolphins season was the 38th season for the team in the National Football League and 42nd season overall.  The team nearly went winless for the season, but on December 16, the third to last game of the regular season, they beat the Baltimore Ravens, giving them a final record of 1–15.  The Detroit Lions became the first team to go 0–16 the following season.  Their only win of the season gave them the first pick in the 2008 NFL draft.  They also failed to improve upon a 6–10 season in 2006.  Under former head coach Nick Saban in a year that began with high hopes, Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the head coach at the University of Alabama, after repeatedly saying he would stay with the Dolphins.  The Dolphins entered 2007 in the process of rebuilding under new head coach Cam Cameron, the former offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers.  The coaching staff underwent significant changes, with approximately twelve coaches newly hired or reassigned.  Cameron also made various changes to the team's roster, with more than a dozen players being added or re-signed and just as many being released, traded or allowed to sign elsewhere.  Six of the team's losses in 2007 were by margins of three points or less.\n1995 New York Jets season:The 1995 New York Jets season was the 36th season for the team and the 26th in the National Football League.  The Jets entered the 1995 season with their third different head coach in as many years as former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Rich Kotite was hired to replace Pete Carroll, who was fired after posting a 6–10 record in his only season as Jets head coach.  Kotite did not have any success in his first year, as the team finished 3–13.  The 13 losses set a team record, while the 3 wins were the fewest of any Jets team since 1977, when the team completed their third consecutive 3–11 season.\n2008–09 Phoenix Suns season:The 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season was the 41st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The season was to be a promising one, filled with All-Star talent at several positions.  It was believed over the offseason, the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal, who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago.  It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock.  Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game.  However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach.  Less than one week after the All-Star Game, Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a season-ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came.  The Suns finished 46–36, second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004–05 season.\nLisa Ryckbosch:Lisa Ryckbosch is the current director of Professional, Corporate & Community Relations at DePaul University.  She previously served as the head coach of the UIC Flames women's basketball team from 2002 to 2011 and holds the record for most wins in UIC women's basketball history.  In her fifth season as head coach, the Flames made their first post-season appearance in the WNIT following their best-ever finish in the Horizon League.  Upon completion of the 2010–11 season, her record with the flames was 128–139.  Ryckbosch came to UIC after eleven seasons as an assistant coach at Depaul, from 1991 until 2002, and one season as an assistant coach at UIC from 1990 to 1991.  Ryckbosch graduated from Loyola in 1984 after starting for the Ramblers for four years and serving as a team captain for two seasons, and in 2006 was inducted in Loyola's Athletics Hall of Fame.  After graduation she began her coaching career at Hillcrest High School in Country Club Hills, Illinois, where she served as the Head Girls' Varsity Basketball Coach and a math teacher for three years.\n2009–10 Luton Town F.C. season:The 2009–10 season was the 124th season in the history of Luton Town Football Club.  Luton's 24th-place finish in Football League Two in 2008–09 meant that the club competed in the Conference Premier for the first time in its history, and in a division outside of the Football League for the first time since the beginning of their second spell as a member in 1920.  Although tipped as favourites for the title and promotion before the season had even begun, the club struggled to immediately adapt to life in the new division, ultimately costing manager Mick Harford his job.  Richard Money was appointed as new manager soon after, eventually leading the club to an unbeaten run of 14 games towards the end of the season that propelled them to a second place finish in the league.  However, defeat in the play-off semi-finals to York City meant Luton were to remain in the Conference for the 2010–11 season.\n1977 New York Jets season:The 1977 New York Jets season was the 18th season for the team and the 8th in the National Football League.  It began with the team trying to improve upon its 3–11 record from 1976 under new head coach Walt Michaels and beginning the post-Joe Namath era.  However, the Jets struggled with their third consecutive 3-11 season.  They won a major off the field court decision.  As per the memorandum of understanding signed in late 1961 by team original owner (as the New York Titans) Harry Wismer, Shea Stadium's co-tenants, the New York Mets, would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season.  The Jets were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs.  Feeling that this arrangement was a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium.  Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease.  In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea.  From 1967 through this season—a span of 11 seasons—the Jets did not play a home game at Shea Stadium in the month of September.  As of 2017, the Jets are the first (and so far, only) team in NFL history to finish 3 straight seasons with only 3 wins.  Since the NFL schedule expanded to 16 games in 1978, no team has finished 3-13 3 years in a row.\n\nAnswer:"

Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides.

One author described it as \"the pre-eminent diurnal predator of medium-sized birds and mammals in open country throughout the Northern Hemisphere\".  Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season through their whole range.  The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey.  A fully-grown golden eagle requires about 230 to of food per day.  In the life of most eagles, there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week.  Following these periods without food, they will then gorge on up to 900 g at one sitting.  The powerful talons of the golden eagle ensure that few prey can escape them once contact is made.  The talons of this species exert approximately 440 psi of pressure, around 15 times more pressure than is exerted by the human hand, although some opine that the largest individual females may reach a pressure of 750 psi .  Few other large raptors have been tested in their foot strength, though the huge harpy eagle, when tested, exerted a psi approximately 40 kg more than the tested golden eagle.  It has been claimed that the golden eagle can lift more than their own body weight in flight.\n\nAnswer:"

It is unusual for Agatha Christie plays in more than one way: for example, it is an original play, not based on a story or novel; and though there is a murder in the story, it is a melodrama more than a typical 'whodunnit' mystery as the murder takes place on stage.\nStar Over Bethlehem:Star Over Bethlehem is an illustrated book of poetry and short stories on a religious theme by crime writer Agatha Christie.

In the United States the film was first broadcast on 4 January 1986 as a part of PBS's \"Mystery! \".  In his review in \"The New York Times\", critic John J. O'Connor wrote: \"Miss Christie would no doubt approve of Joan Hickson, the veteran British character actress who plays Miss Marple... This BBC/Arts & Entertainment co-production offers an especially good example of Agatha Christie in adaptation.  The characters are nicely realized and the suspense holds.  Miss Hickson is lovely, neither as awesome as Miss Rutherford nor as overly cute as Helen Hayes.  And the supporting cast is admirable, particularly Gwen Watford as Dolly and David Horovitch as Inspector Slack.  As someone notes about the case, 'you'll have to admit it has all the bizarre elements of a cheap thriller.'  Once hooked, you won't be able to turn it off.\"\nAgatha Christie Award (Japan):Agatha Christie Award (Japan): The Agatha Christie Award (アガサ・クリスティー賞 ) is a Japanese literary award established in 2010 in commemoration of the 120th anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth.

As a form of \"escapist fiction\" (escapism) and \"commercial literature\", Tagalog romance novels generally follow a \"strict romance formula\", meaning the narratives have happy endings (a factor influencing the salability of the novel), the protagonists are wealthy, good-looking, smart, and characters that cannot die.  Normally, the hero or heroine of the story falls in love and \"goes crazy\" over the admired person.  However, later authors of Tagalog romance novels deviated from portraying so-called \"damsel-in-distress and knight-in-shining-armor characters\".  Contemporary writers also turned away from writing \"rags-to-riches plots\".  The stereotypical norm had been replaced by the incorporation of storylines with \"interesting scenes, characters [who are ready to face challenges or to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of other people], dialogues, and new angles to old plots\".  Authors such as Maria Teresa Cruz San Diego, who used the pen names Maia Jose and Tisha Nicole, ventured into the fantasy romance genre, and into topics that are related to politics, ecology, gender issues, prostitution, mail-order bride syndicates, white slavery, non-governmental organizations, and breastfeeding programs.  Apart from writing about ideal lovers (men and women) and ideal situations, other novelists wrote about true-to-life settings, or at least based the stories from personal experiences.  Thus, Tagalog romance novels came to mirror or replicate the \"roles that women and men play\" in Philippine society.\n\nAnswer:"

Erwin to manage the enterprise.  The mill’s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin’s and his successors’ exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers.

The organization's donation/distribution center, located at 115 Mansell Place in Roswell GA is set up like a retail store and is fully stocked with clothing, toys, bikes, highchairs, and other necessities, where foster parents throughout the state can come, by appointment, and shop for free.

Johnson that he would not seek the party's nomination.  Johnson had been stalled by the anti-Vietnam War candidacy of Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, who along with Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, became the main opponents for Humphrey.  The contest between the men featured a battle for control of the Democratic Party, and cast Humphrey's \"old politics\", against the \"new politics\" of McCarthy and Kennedy.  The main cause of the division was the Vietnam War, which intensified during Humphrey's tenure as Vice President and grew increasingly unpopular.\n2000 Democratic National Convention:The 2000 Democratic National Convention was a quadrennial presidential nominating convention for the Democratic Party.

William Howard Taft, the incumbent president, won the nomination of the regular Republican Party.  This split in the GOP ranks divided the Republican vote and led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.  Although several candidates were openly competing for the 1916 nomination—most prominently conservative Senator Elihu Root of New York, Senator John W. Weeks of Massachusetts, and liberal Senator Albert Cummins of Iowa—the party's bosses wanted a moderate who would be acceptable to all factions of the party.  They turned to Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who had served on the court since 1910 and thus had the advantage of not having publicly spoken about political issues in six years.  Although he had not sought the nomination, Hughes made it known that he would not turn it down; he won the nomination on the third ballot.  Former Vice-President Charles W.

Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.  High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.  It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set.  This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.\n\nAnswer:"

In what month did Francis Asbury begin attending the revival meetings ?\nDocs:Revival of 1800:The Revival of 1800 was a series of evangelical Christian meetings which began in Logan County, Kentucky, which ignited the subsequent events and influenced several of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening.  The events represented a transition from traditions carried over from Europe to innovations that responded to the unique needs and personality of Americans in the new century.  The startling manifestations of revival fervor that first occurred in June 1800 at the Red River Meeting House, a small Presbyterian congregation led by James McGready, began as a Scottish sacrament service, but brought about the important innovation of serial religious services later known as camp meetings.  These multi-day gatherings hosted people from great distances for outdoor services focused on the heart-felt conversion and religious enthusiasm that came to characterize especially rural evangelicalism throughout the nineteenth century.  The Logan County revival quickly spread into the larger Cumberland region of southwestern Kentucky and middle Tennessee and expanded outward in all directions attracting the attention of evangelical leaders such as Presbyterian-turned-Disciples of Christ leader, Barton Stone, and Methodists Francis Asbury and Peter Cartwright, as well as leaders in the Shaker and Cumberland Presbyterian movements, all of whom attended the revival meetings in their initial year-long period beginning in June 1800 and continuing through May 1801.\nRevival meeting:Revival meeting: A revival meeting is a series of Christian religious services held to inspire active members of a church body to gain new converts.  Nineteenth-century Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon said, \"Many blessings may come to the unconverted in consequence of a revival among Christians, but the revival itself has to do only with those who already possess spiritual life.\"  These meetings are usually conducted by churches or missionary organizations throughout the world.  Notable historic revival meetings were conducted in the US by evangelist Billy Sunday and in Wales by evangelist Evan Roberts.\nBrownsville Revival:The Brownsville Revival (also known as the Pensacola Outpouring) was a widely reported Christian revival within the Pentecostal Movement that began on Father's Day June 18, 1995, at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida.  Characteristics of the Brownsville Revival movement, as with other Christian religious revivals, included acts of repentance by parishioners and a call to holiness, said to be inspired by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.  Some of the occurrences in this revival fit the description of moments of religious ecstasy.  More than four million people are reported to have attended the revival meetings from its beginnings in 1995 to around 2000.\nTent revival:A tent revival is a gathering of Christian worshipers in a tent erected specifically for revival meetings, healing crusades, and church rallies.  Tent revivals have had both local and national ministries.\nEvangelical Christian Church in Canada:The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) as an evangelical Protestant Canadian church body in North America (2004) can be traced to the formal organization of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1804, in Bourbon County, Kentucky under the leadership of Barton Warren Stone (1772–1844).  The Stone Movement later merged with the efforts of Thomas Campbell (1772–1854) and his son Alexander Campbell (1788–1866) to become the Restoration Movement that gave birth to the Churches of Christ (Non-Instrumental), the Christian churches and churches of Christ, the Churches of Christ (non-institutional), and the Disciples of Christ.  The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) as a separate group within the Restoration tradition was reorganized in 2001.  The Evangelical Christian Church's national office in Canada is in Waterloo, Ontario.\nJohn S. Coffman:John S. Coffman (October 16, 1848 – July 22, 1899) was a leader in the Mennonite Church in the late 19th century.

It was a declaration of faith, and although Quakers do not have a dogma or creed, the Richmond Declaration has been used as a standard by certain groups of Quakers, mainly Orthodox (now represented by Friends United Meeting) and Evangelical (represented by Evangelical Friends International), ever since.  The Declaration was \"approved,\" \"accepted,\" or \"adopted\" by the Orthodox Yearly Meetings of Indiana, Western, New England, New York, Baltimore, North Carolina, Iowa, and Canada.  Among Orthodox Gurneyite Friends in North America, only Ohio and Philadelphia yearly meetings did not so act.  The Friends United Meeting General Board reaffirmed the declaration as a statement of faith in February 2007.  The Declaration appears in most books of discipline of Evangelical and Friends United Meeting yearly meetings.\nChristian music festival:A Christian music festival (also known as a Jesus music festival or simply a Jesus festival) is a music festival held by the Christian community, in support of performers of Christian music.  The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars on Christian spiritual and missions topics, service, and evangelism.  They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional revival meetings.  While the central theme of a Christian festival is Jesus Christ, the core appeal of a Christian music festival remains the artists and their music.  Critics point out that the dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals.  In similar ways as the Christian music industry in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and gravitate toward commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds.\nFalcon Tabernacle:The Falcon Tabernacle, also known as the Octagon Tabernacle and the Little Tabernacle, is an historic octagon-shaped Pentecostal Holiness church building in Falcon, North Carolina.  Built in 1898, it was designed by Julius A. Culbreth (1871-1950) for prayer meetings and was built using wood from trees that had been uprooted by a tornado.  Culbreth, who was the founder of Falcon, chose the octagon shape because it reminded him of the tents used in revival meetings.  In 1900 the building became the home of the Falcon Pentecostal Holiness Church, of which Culbreth was a leader.\n\nAnswer:"

His succession as King of Jerusalem was opposed by Charles I of Naples, who had also disrupted his father's succession.  John died the following year on 20 May, having never married and leaving no children.  He was buried in the church of St. Demetrius or according to some Santa Sophia, in Nicosia.  According to some authors he was poisoned by his brothers, one of whom, Henry II, succeeded him in Cyprus and Jerusalem.

It was created on 31 October 1737 for Charles Payne.  According to some sources that title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet, Sir Gillis Payne, in 1801.  Sir Gillis was in a relationship with a farmer's daughter, Maria Keeling.  They apparently married in 1761 although several children had been born before this date.  Peter Payne was the eldest son born after the marriage and would normally have succeeded in the title.  However, he allowed his eldest brother John Payne to assume the title, although John was illegitimate.  John died in 1803 when his son Charles assumed the title.  However, in 1828 Peter Payne raised the question in the courts over who was the rightful baronet.  The Court of Chancery declared that he was the rightful heir to his father, but this was overturned by the Lord Chancellor in 1829.  Nonetheless, during his lifetime Sir Peter was universally acknowledged as a baronet.  Most reference books on the British nobility and baronetage include the title, although they describe it as being in dispute between rival branches of the family.  Charles Robert Salusbury Payne, the supposed sixth Baronet, appears to have discontinued the claim around 1900.\nJohn of Islay, Earl of Ross:John of Islay (or John MacDonald) (1434–1503) was a late medieval Scottish magnate.

His struggle for power with King James III of Scotland ended in humiliation, following which his illegitimate son Angus Óg rebelled against his rule.  In a bitter civil war, John's fleet of galleys met those of Angus sometime in the early 1480s off the coast of Mull at the Battle of Bloody Bay, in which John's cause was defeated.  After Bloody Bay he became an inconsequential figure; and Angus continued to dominate the affairs of Clan Donald up until his murder in 1490.

John died unlamented in 1503, having witnessed the almost complete destruction of his family inheritance.\nJohn FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond:John FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond (d. 1536) was the brother of Thomas FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Desmond.

He was born in London in 1547, and is described by Anthony Wood as a \"most dexterous person in his profession, to the great wonder of scholars and others\".  We are also informed that \"he spent several years in sciences among Oxonians, particularly, as it seems, in Gloucester Hall; but that study, which he used for a diversion only, proved at length an employment of profit.\"  He is mentioned for his skill in micrography in \"Holinshed's Chronicle\".\nWilliam Harrison (priest):William Harrison (18 April 1534 – 24 April 1593) was an English clergyman, whose \"Description of England\" was produced as part of the publishing venture of a group of London stationers who produced Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\" (London 1577).

The origin of the character lies in a narrative of the historical Donnchad mac Crinain, King of Scots, in Raphael Holinshed's 1587 \"The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\" a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries.

The painting exemplifies Raphael's development as an artist and the culmination of his career.  Unusually for a depiction of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art, the subject is combined with an additional episode from the Gospels in the lower part of the painting.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:What is the rule that makes a major difference between the National League and the American League that allows another player to bat for the pitcher?\nDocs:Designated hitter:In baseball, the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11, adopted by the American League in 1973.  The rule allows teams to have one player, known as the designated hitter (abbreviated DH), to bat in place of the pitcher.  Since 1973, most collegiate, amateur, and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant.  MLB's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.\nDefensive substitution:Defensive substitution: A defensive substitution in the game of baseball occurs when a currently non-playing player is placed into the field in place of another player, typically due either to injury or the appearance of a pinch hitter.  In the American League, a pinch hitter is usually substituted for the position player in whose place he batted (although another common substitution is pinch-hitting a utility infielder for a second baseman and subsequently switching him for the shortstop in the field while moving the shortstop over to the now-vacant second base position).  In the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, pinch hitters sometimes bat for pitchers. However, another common pitcher-substitution strategy in the NL is the double switch, in which a pitching change is coupled with a pinch-hitter who is also defensively substituted for a second player.\nList of Major League Baseball batting champions:In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.\nHistory of the American League:The History of the American League, officially known as the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs and often abbreviated AL, stretched back into the late-19th century.  Prior to 2000, when the AL and NL were dissolved as separate entities and merged into the organization called Major League Baseball, the American League was one of the two leagues that made up major league baseball.  Originally a minor league known as the Western League, the league later developed into a major league after the American Association disbanded.  In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league.  Johnson led the Western League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League.  The American League has one notable difference over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule.  Under the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to hit.\nList of Chicago White Sox no-hitters:The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Chicago.  They play in the American League Central division.  Pitchers for the White Sox have thrown eighteen no-hitters in franchise history.  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings.  In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher’s interference.”  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form.  A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat.  Three perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been pitched in White Sox history, which equals the New York Yankees for the most perfect games pitched by any MLB franchise.  As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.”  These feats were achieved by Charlie Robertson in 1922, which was the first perfect game on the road in MLB history, Mark Buehrle in 2009, and Philip Humber in 2012.\n1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game:The 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 57th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball.  The game was held on July 15, 1986, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, the home of the Houston Astros of the National League.  The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3-2 and ended a streak where the NL won 13 of the last 14 games.  Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens was named the Most Valuable Player.\nList of Milwaukee Brewers no-hitters:The Milwaukee Brewers (formerly known as the \"Seattle Pilots\" in 1969) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Formed in 1969, they play in the National League Central division (formerly in the American League Central Division until 1997).  Juan Nieves threw the only no-hitter in franchise history on April 15, 1987.  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only \"when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings\".  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form.  A no-hitter is rare enough that a Major League Baseball team, the San Diego Padres, has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat.  A perfect game, a special subcategory of no-hitter, has yet to be thrown in Brewers history.  As defined by Major League Baseball, \"in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.\"\nList of Houston Astros no-hitters:The Houston Astros (formerly known as the \"Houston Colt .45s\" from 1962–64) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Houston, Texas.  Formed in 1962, they play in the American League West division (formerly in the National League Central division until 2012).  Pitchers for the Astros have thrown eleven no-hitters in franchise history.  A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings”.  No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form.  A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat.  No perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been thrown in Astros history.  As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.”\nBill Pounds:Jeared Wells \"Bill\" Pounds (March 11, 1878 – July 7, 1936) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.  He appeared in just two major league games, one each for Cleveland and Brooklyn in 1903, but the only surviving images of him in a major league uniform show him with the New York Highlanders.  Bill Pounds was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a long career as a minor league pitcher.  His professional career began in 1899 when he pitched for both Binghamton and Paterson.  After a year out of organized baseball, he played in 1901 and 1902 for two Ilion and Utica in the New York State League.  After reportedly signing a contract to return to Utica for 1903, he was signed by Cleveland in the American League and was on their Opening Day roster.  Pounds was brought in to pitch on May 2 in the fourth inning in Chicago when the White Stockings had opened up a big lead; he gave up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in the 16-6 loss.  On May 18 he was released by Cleveland and was signed shortly thereafter by the New York Highlanders.  Pounds was in uniform with the team when the Highlanders visited Chicago for a series May 20–22.  A photographer from the Chicago Daily News was taking pictures of the players on the teams visiting both the American League and National League ballparks, and during this visit Pounds had his image preserved for posterity.  Before the end of the month, without having appeared in a game for New York, Pounds was sent back to Cleveland, apparently because he could not come to terms on a contract.  On June 4 he was signed by Brooklyn of the National League, but he did not appear in a game until June 30.  With Pittsburg ahead 12-0 after three innings, Pounds was sent in to pitch.  He allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings on eight hits and two walks in the 17-8 loss, and gave up a long home run to Honus Wagner.  On July 3, his contract was transferred to Baltimore of the Eastern League, along with that of Hughie Jennings and three other Dodgers.  Pounds would never appear in another major league game; though his pitching record was unimpressive, he finished with a lifetime batting record of three hits in five at-bats.  Late in the 1903 season, his contract was purchased by Denver, but it is unclear whether he actually played in Colorado.  For the remainder of his minor-league career, from 1904 through 1911, he pitched for teams within a couple of hundred miles of his birth—four teams in the New York State League and two in the Tri-State League.  In the off-seasons he would sometimes pitch for the Paterson Elks team, and he continued to pitch for them after his minor-league career had ended.  According to The Sporting Life, “Pounds has speed and a rather good assortment of curves.  He has not the best control in the world.”  A few years after his career had ended, the Utica Observer described him in this way: “Bill Pounds was the champion sweater of the league.  He perspired so much that…a miniature lake (formed) around the slab.”  He died in 1936 in the city of his birth, aged 58.  Early in the 21st century, the photographic archives of the Chicago Daily News were posted online.  Although his teammates’ photographs were easily identified, the image of Pounds remained unidentified, or occasionally misidentified as Doc Adkins, for at least a decade.\nPaixiao:The paixiao (traditional: 排簫; simplified: 排箫; pinyin: \"páixiāo\"; also pái xiāo, pai-hsiao, pronounced ] ) is an ancient Chinese wind instrument, a form of Pan flute.  A major difference between the Chinese Paixiao and the panpipes used in European and South American traditions, is that at the top of the Chinese instrument the pipe holes are each cut angled or with notches.  This allows for bending the pitch in similar capacity to the dongxiao down a minor second.  This allows Chinese paixiao to be fully chromatic without loss in timbre, even though the included pipes are tuned diatonically.\n\nAnswer:"

It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams.  The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily.  It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems.  Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a \"coffee\" drink.\nMarsileaceae:The Marsileaceae are a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns, though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns.  The group is commonly known as the \"pepperwort family\" or as the \"water-clover family\" because the leaves of the genus \"Marsilea\" superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant).  Leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day.

Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia.  Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals.  There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.  The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979.  Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils.  They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry.\nAraripesuchus wegeneri:Araripesuchus is an extinct genus of notosuchian crocodyliform that lived in Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period.  The genus includes at least five species found throughout Western Africa and South America.  The relationship of the individual species within this genus is hotly debated, specifically, the placement of Araripesuchus wegeneri.  \"A. wegeneri\" is a small bodied crocodyliform characterized by relatively elongate limbs, an upright gait, and marked heterodonty.  The tooth morphology, when combined with tooth wear and orientation, suggests that this animal may have been an omnivore or herbivore.  Additionally, the gracile limbs and their orientation imply that this was a terrestrial animal.  These features demonstrate that \"Araripesuchus wegeneri\" stands in stark contrast to its modern-day relatives, crocodiles and alligators.\nMyiodynastes:Myiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae.  Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as \"sulphur-bellied flycatchers\"; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus.  The genus name \"Myiodynastes\" is a compound word composed from two Greek words: \"muia\", meaning \"fly\" and \"dunastẽs\", meaning \"ruler\".\nSinocyclocheilus:Sinocyclocheilus is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae endemic to China, where only found in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.  Almost all of its species live in or around caves and most of these have adaptions typical of cavefish such as a lack of scales, lack of pigmentation and reduced eyes (some are completely blind).  Several species have an unusual hunchbacked appearance and some of the cave-dwellers have a \"horn\" on the back (above the forehead), the function of which is unclear.  In contrast, the \"Sinocyclocheilus\" species that live aboveground, as well as a few found underground, show no clear cavefish adaptions.  They are relatively small fish reaching up to 23 cm in length.  The individual species have small ranges and populations, leading to the status of most of the evaluated species as threatened.  Many species populations in the genus have yet to be evaluated.\nBe'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard:The Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard (\"Acanthodactylus beershebensis\") is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family.  It is a member of the subgenus Lacertinae, and the tribe Acanthodactylus (spiny footed lizards).  Considered a separate species based on morphological distinction, and isolated location; it shares a large portion of its genetics with \"Acanthodactylus pardalis\" in this genus.  Many of the individual species under this genus are similar, but varying coloration explains why each species have been separated.  Like all \"Acanthodactylus\", the beershebensis lays eggs, varying from three to seven eggs at a time.  Adults vary in size from 17 to 20 centimeters, but can get much larger.  It is endemic to the loess scrublands of the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a biodiversity hotspot.\nFen:Fen: A fen is one of the main types of wetland, the others being grassy marshes, forested swamps, and peaty bogs. Along with bogs, fens are a kind of mire.  Fens are minerotrophic peatlands, usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or groundwater.  They are characterised by their distinct water chemistry, which is pH neutral or alkaline, with relatively high dissolved mineral levels but few other plant nutrients.  They are usually dominated by grasses and sedges, and typically have brown mosses in general including \"Scorpidium\" or \"Drepanocladus\".  Fens frequently have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as \"Pinguicula\".  They may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants.  The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations.\nFire regime:A fire regime is the pattern, frequency, and intensity of the bushfires and wildfires that prevail in an area over long periods of time.  It is an integral part of fire ecology, and renewal for certain types of ecosystems.  If fires are too frequent, plants may be killed before they have matured, or before they have set sufficient seed to ensure population recovery.  If fires are too infrequent, plants may mature, senesce, and die without ever releasing their seed.  Fire is a type of disturbance regime that can define an ecosystem.  Disturbance regimes like fire can change soil erosion, soil formation, nutrient cycles, energy flow, and other ecosystem characteristics.  Disruption of an ecosystem can allow changes in species dominance and mutations in individual species.  Fire regimes can change with the spatial and temporal variations in topography, climate, and fuel.\n\nAnswer:"

Its Connecticut segment was called the Farmington Canal.\nTennessee–Tombigbee Waterway:The Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway (popularly known as the Tenn-Tom) is a 234-mile (377-kilometer) man-made waterway that extends from the Tennessee River to the junction of the Black Warrior-Tombigbee River system near Demopolis, Alabama, United States.  The Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway links commercial navigation from the nation’s midsection to the Gulf of Mexico.  The major features of the waterway are 10 locks and dams, a 175 ft deep cut between the Tombigbee River watershed and the Tennessee River watershed, and 234 mi of navigation channels.\nFarmington Canal:The Farmington Canal, also known as the New Haven and Northampton Canal, was a major private canal built in the early 19th century to provide water transportation from New Haven into the interior of Connecticut, Massachusetts and beyond.  Its Massachusetts segment was known as the Hampshire and Hampden Canal.  With the advent of railroads, it was quickly converted to a railroad in the mid-19th century and in recent years has been converted to a multi-use trail (a rails-to-trails project) after being abandoned for years.\nTombigbee River:The Tombigbee River is a tributary of the Mobile River, approximately 200 mi (325 km) long, in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama.  Together with the Alabama, it merges to form the short Mobile River before the latter empties into Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico.  The Tombigbee watershed encompasses much of the rural coastal plain of western Alabama and northeastern Mississippi, flowing generally southward.  The river provides one of the principal routes of commercial navigation in the southern United States, as it is navigable along much of its length through locks and connected in its upper reaches to the Tennessee River via the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.\nIllinois Waterway:The Illinois Waterway system consists of 336 mi of water from the mouth of the Calumet River to the mouth of the Illinois River at Grafton, Illinois.  It is a system of rivers, lakes, and canals which provide a shipping connection from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.  The Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1849.  In 1900, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal replaced it and reversed the flow of the Chicago River so it no longer flowed into Lake Michigan.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains a 9 ft navigation channel in the waterway.  The waterway's complex northern section is referred to in various contexts for study and management as the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).\nHolcut, Mississippi:Holcut was a small town located in Tishomingo County, Mississippi, United States.  In 1976, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers bought out and then completely demolished the town because it lay directly in the path of the Divide Cut, a 29 mi artificial canal section of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway, which was constructed between 1972 and 1984.\nBlack Warrior River:The Black Warrior River is a waterway in west-central Alabama in the southeastern United States.  The river rises in the extreme southern edges of the Appalachian Highlands and flows 178 miles (286 km) to the Tombigbee River, of which the Black Warrior is the primary tributary.  The river is named after the Mississippian paramount chief Tuskaloosa, whose name meant 'Black Warrior' in Muskogean.  The Black Warrior is impounded along nearly its entire course by a series of locks and dams to form a chain of reservoirs that not only provide a path for an inland waterway, but also yield hydroelectric power, drinking water, and industrial water.\nGaines Trace:Gaines Trace: The Gaines Trace was a road in the Mississippi Territory.  It was constructed in 1811 and 1812 from the Tennessee River (opposite the Elk River's mouth) to Cotton Gin Port on the upper Tombigbee River and on to Fort Stoddert on the lower Tombigbee.  The portion from the Tennessee River to Cotton Gin Port was surveyed in 1807 and 1808 by Edmund P. Gaines, the road's namesake.\nHampden County, Massachusetts:Hampden County is a non-governmental county located in the Pioneer Valley of the state of Massachusetts, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, Hampden County's population was 463,490.  Its traditional county seat is Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's largest city, and economic and cultural capital.  Hampden County was split from Hampshire County in 1812, because Northampton, Massachusetts, was made Hampshire County's \"shire town\" in 1794; however, Springfield—theretofore Hampshire County's traditional shire town, dating back to its founding in 1636—grew at a pace far quicker than Northampton and was granted shire town-status over its own, southerly jurisdiction.  It was named for John Hampden.  To the north of Hampden County is modern-day Hampshire County; to the west is Berkshire County; to the east is Worcester County; to the south are Litchfield County, Hartford County, and Tolland County in Connecticut.\nVyshny Volochyok Waterway:Vyshny Volochyok Waterway (Russian: Вышневолоцкая водная система ) is a waterway connecting the basins of the Baltic and Caspian Seas, or, more specifically, the Msta River and the Tvertsa River, around the town of Vyshny Volochyok of Tver Oblast, Russia.  It was constructed in the 1700s and became the first waterway to connect the basins of the two seas.  The waterway is still in operation, though it was superseded by the Volga–Baltic Waterway and cannot take big ships.  The Vyshny Volochyok Waterway is one of the three canal systems connecting the Neva and the Volga, the other two being the Volga–Baltic Waterway and the Tikhvinskaya water system.\n\nAnswer:"

Decca, Holly’s first major record label, after failing to produce a hit single from Holly’s early recordings, packaged these 1956 tunes after he had some success with recordings from the Brunswick and Coral labels, i.e. the previously released single \"That'll Be the Day\".

The singer incorporated elements of genres such as blues and rock, in addition to traditional country ballads.  \"Best Friends of Mine\", an autobiographical song, is a tribute to Buddy Holly, Hank Williams, Jr. and one of Jennings' close friends from his days in Phoenix.  Carl Smith, one of the performer's idols, appears on \"Untitled Waltz\".  In an interview, the singer mentioned that he wasn't fully satisfied with his take on The Rolling Stones' \"No Expectations\", calling it \"\"a little more contrived than I would have liked\"\".

His work has appeared in \"The New York Times\", \"The New Yorker\", \"GQ\", the \"Smithsonian\", and the \"MIT Technology Review\".  He has also served as an instructor in journalism at Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and Boston University.\nThe Billion-Dollar Molecule:The Billion-Dollar Molecule is a book by journalist Barry Werth about the founding and early research efforts of the American biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger and was among the first biotechnology companies to adopt an explicit strategy of rational drug design as opposed to techniques based on combinatorial chemistry.\nAlembic (magazine):Alembic was a poetry magazine established by Peter Barry, Ken Edwards, and Robert Gavin Hampson, which appeared eight times during the 1970s.  The first issue appeared in 1973: it was a collection of poems by Barry, Edwards, Hampson and Jim Stewart with graphic work by John Simpson, Robert Snell and Sibani Raychaudhuri.  The work was printed on different colours and sizes of paper - and contained in a plastic bag.  It was sold at the Edinburgh Festival of 1973, where Hampson was working with the Liverpool-based multimedia group Zoom Cortex.  (See Adrian Henri, \"Events and Happenings\", Thames and Hudson, for Zoom Cortex.) The second issue maintained the same format (a collection of loose pages in a plastic bag) but with an increased number of poets.  Richard Kostelanetz's assemblages have been described by the editors as their model for this mode of publication.  With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled.  Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London-based experimental poetry.  \"Alembic\" 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with \"one area of contemporary creative practice' in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK.  This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism.  It included Lee Harwood's essay 'Surrealist Poetry Today', which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others.  \"Alembic\" 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry and the idea of place.  Allen Fisher was the featured poet: in addition to work by him, there was also an interview with him conducted by Barry and Edwards.  This issue also included work by Roy Fisher, Eric Mottram, and a small number of American poets, including Alan Davies, who was to be associated with LANGUAGE poetry.  \"Alembic\" 5 (Autumn 1976)was edited solely by Edwards and focused on experimental prose, including work by Paul Buck, Opal Nations, Jeff Nuttall, Maxim Jakubowski, David Miller, the Canadian writer Greg Hollingshead and James Sherry, who was also associated with LANGUAGE poetry.  This issue was also the first to be offset.  (Like \"Alembic\" 4.  it had a wrap around cover rather than card.)  \"Alembic\" 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson.  It included further work by contributors to earlier issues.  The featured poet was the Australian poet David Miller: as well as poems and essays by Miller, there was also poetry by Robert Lax and a reprint of work by Charles Madge, on both of whom Miller had written.  In addition, there was also work by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Elaine Randell and Barry MacSweeney.  \"Alembic\" 7 (Spring 1978), edited by Edwards and Hampson out of Lower Green Farm, was the 'Assemblage Issue', assembled by inviting a range of poets and visual artists to provide the contents.  It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna-Michel, Lawrence Upton and others.  A particular feature of this issue was that every cover was different: they were hand-printed by Vonna-Michel with a rubber-stamp used for the title.  \"Alembic\" 9 (to be edited by Hampson) was promised, but never appeared: Edwards had begun to publish \"Reality Studios\" as a slimmer, faster and more frequent publication.  This eventually metamorphosed (through an amalgamation with Wendy Mulford's Street Editions) into Reality Street, which has been a major publisher of experimental poetry and prose since the 1980s.\nTerror Australis:Terror Australis: the Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine (1988-1992) was Australia's first mass market horror magazine.  It succeeded the \"Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine\" (1984–87) edited by Barry Radburn and Stephen Studach and was the first semi-professional magazine of its kind in Australia to pay authors.  After working on the production crew of AH&FM, when Radburn eventually suspended publication, Leigh Blackmore took over the subscription base and with co-editors Chris G.C. Sequeira and Bryce J.

He started to make his first kanteles in 1957 while he was working as a pilot on Pielinen Lake in North Karelia.  As the first instrument was completed during winter 1957, Koistinen found out a number of lacks in construction and sound and thus lifetime development of Finnish and later Estonian chromatic kanteles was initiated.  The influence of the family has always had an important role in this process.  Otto’s daughter, Ritva Koistinen, started to play kantele at early age showing high level of talent and thus brought motivation for her father’s work.  Otto's son Hannu Koistinen started to build kanteles with his father at the age of seven and later continued to develop the instrument and preserve family tradition by establishing Koistinen Kantele company.\n\nAnswer:"

It was formerly placed in the monotypic genus \"Nangura\" but was moved to \"Concinnia\" following the molecular phylogenetic studies of O'Connor & Moritz (2003) and Skinner and co-authors (2013).  This species is known only from two localities; the type locality, now in Nangura National Park, and a much smaller isolated population in Oakview National Park and adjacent Oakview State Forest.  The total distribution spans just 42 square kilometers, within which this species occupies less than 4 square kilometers, with an estimated population size of less than 200 individuals.  It is threatened by invasive species including cats, pigs, dogs, foxes and Cane Toads, by the invasive plant species Lantana camara, which increases fire risk and changes forest structure, and in some sites by logging and road maintenance.  Consequently, it is listed as Critically Endangered under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 It resembles \"Concinnia queenslandiae\" in its spiny scales and like that species it is live bearing.  Along with minor differences in scalation, the Nangur Spiny Skink differs from other Australian Sphenomorphid skinks in its karyotype of 2n=28 chromosomes, where most others have 2n=30.  It is also unlike related species in that it lives in burrows, which occur in small colonies through the dry rainforest habitat.  There is some indication of parental care in this species, with adults sharing burrows with juveniles.\n\nAnswer:"

She was an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware, who wasn't rehired after she made controversial comments on the death of Otto Warmbier, a college student who had been imprisoned in North Korea.\nKim Sang-duk (academic):Kim Sang-duk (Hangul: 김상덕 ; born c. 1959), also known as Tony Kim, is a Korean-American former professor teaching accounting at the Business Administration School of Yanbian University of Science and Technology (YUST) in the northeastern Chinese city of Yanji, near the Chinese border with North Korea.  According to Voice of America Korea reports, he was a regional director in charge of transporting foreign aid materials to several areas affected by the 2016 floods in North Korea while his humanitarian work has gone on for more than 10 years.  On April 22, 2017, Kim, a U.S. citizen, and his wife were detained and Kim was subsequently arrested at Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang as he was waiting to board a flight.  As of June 2017, Kim is currently one of three Americans being held by North Korea; the others are Kim Dong-chul and Kim Hak-Song.\nUniversity of Natural Science:Institute of Natural Science (INS) is a university located inside the region of the National Academy of Science in Pyongyang, North Korea.  As Kim Il-sung, a former leader of North Korea, emphasized the significance of education for gifted and talented students, INS originally started as a branch of Kim Il-sung University on January 17, 1962.  It was separated from Kim Il-sung University in 1985.  In South Korean mass media, this university is called \"KAIST of North Korea\".  Top students of natural sciences or engineering in North Korea study at this university supported totally by North Korean government.  Eighty percent of them is graduated from No.1 Middle Schools, which are science high schools for gifted and talented students in North Korea, and the rest thirty percent are medal winners in the national science (math, physics, chemistry, and biology) olympiads or national science quiz contests.\nUnited States in the Korean War:At the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.\nCommunism in Korea:The Communist movement in Korea emerged as a political movement in the early 20th century.  Although the movement had a minor role in pre-war politics, the division between the communist North Korea and the anti-communist South Korea came to dominate Korean political life in the post-World War II era.  North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, continues to be a Juche \"socialist\" state under the rule of the Workers Party of Korea.  In South Korea, communism remains illegal through the National Security Law.  Due to end of economic aid from Soviet Union after Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and impractical ideological application of Communist economy in North Korea over years of economic slowdown in 1980s and receding during 1990s, North Korea replaced Communism with Juche ideology in its 1992 and 1998 Constitutional revision for the personal cult of Kim's family dictatorship and (albeit reluctanly) opening of North Korean market economy reform, though it still remains a centrally planned economy with complete control of the state and agriculture with collectivized farms and state-funded education and healthcare.\nNorth Korea Strategy Center:North Korea Strategy Center (NKSC) is a defector-led NGO that was established in Seoul, South Korea in 2007 to raise awareness about North Korea's human rights conditions, and advocate for freedom and unification in Korea.

East Germany ceased to exist upon German reunification, which meant that diplomatic relations no longer existed between Germany and North Korea.

Relations between the two countries have been almost non-existent since the division of Korea.  During the Korean War in the 1950s, New Zealand troops fought as part of the United Nations force that repelled the North Korean invasion of South Korea.  Since then, New Zealand and North Korea have had little contact, until July 2000 when North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun and New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Phil Goff met in Bangkok, leading to the establishment of diplomatic relations in March 2001.  The New Zealand ambassador to South Korea based in Seoul is also cross-accredited to North Korea.  In 2006, North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon, drawing criticism and suspension of relations by the New Zealand government, which holds a staunch anti-nuclear policy.  New Zealand began re-establishing formal relations in 2007, when the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters visited Pyongyang on November 20 to discuss possible political and economic deals with North Korea, on the basis that it start dismantling its nuclear weapons facilities.\nDenmark–North Korea relations:Denmark–North Korea relations: Denmark–North Korea relations (Korean: 덴마크-조선민주주의인민공화국 관계 ) refers to the current and historical relations between Denmark and North Korea.  Denmark is represented in North Korea through its embassy in Beijing, China.  North Korea is represented in Denmark, through its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.  Denmark supports the efforts to get North Korea back to the six-party talks.\nIran–North Korea relations:Iran–North Korea relations (Korean: 이란-조선민주주의인민공화국 관계 ; Persian: روابط ایران و کره‌ی شمالی‎ ‎ ) are described as being positive by official news agencies of the two countries.  Diplomatic relations picked up following the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the establishment of an Islamic Republic.  Iran and North Korea pledge cooperation in educational, scientific, and cultural spheres.  Some media reports claim this cooperation extends to nuclear cooperation, though official U.S. government publications and academic studies have disputed this.  The United States has been greatly concerned by North Korea's arms deals with Iran, which started during the 1980s with North Korea acting as a third party in arms deals between the Communist bloc and Iran, as well as selling domestically produced weapons to Iran, and North Korea continues selling missile to Iran.  North Korea and Iran are the remaining two members of George W. Bush's \"Axis of evil\", which has led to many of the concerns regarding Iran–North Korea relations.\n\nAnswer:"

As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001–02 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004; This has allowed all of Charlotte's NBA history to be recognized under one single franchise.\n\nAnswer:"

Appointed vice captain was Mathew Scott.  A level of ‘expectancy’ thus ensued and with a start of two competitive friendlies both at home, the league began in earnest with a traditionally unlucky fixture for the ‘Fera away at Cwmavon.  Past history meant for nothing however and a well organised and structured performance ended in a fine 29–19 win.  A repeat showing a week later at home to Brynamman and a 26–6 win, led to a position of a little over-confidence, ‘Fera narrowly exiting the Swansea Valley Cup in the 1st Round three days later away to Morriston.  Back on track with a determined and physical victory at Bryncoch 25–15, the next home game was again against a traditional ‘bogey’ side Kenfig Hill.  This was a typical ‘old style’ West Wales affair with yellow and red cards for both sides, Ystalyfera losing 11–29 after keeping in touch with the visitors for a greater part of the game.  A return to Morriston for a league fixture saw a much better controlled performance with a 20–15 win, and a further win at Pencoed made it four continuous league away victories.  The Pencoed win was the first in the season where Ystalyfera out-played their opponents in every area of the game, the hosts being unable to seek any avenue to secure a fight back.  This repeated itself against Nantyffyllon home and self-confidence was building amongst the side.  Then came Aberavon Green Stars away.  In this game and in the subsequent losses home to Glynneath and away at Seven Sisters, the effort put in by individual players was noticeable, but the co-ordinated team tactics were missing and a struggle against well organised opponents ensued.\n\nAnswer:"

They served the specialised roles of administration, commerce, manufacturing and religion that characterised ancient cities worldwide.  Maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies, even within Mesoamerica, as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities.  They lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central Mexico, such as Teotihuacán and Tenochtitlan.  Maya kings ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities.  Cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products.  This allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status.  Such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies, thus attracting further inhabitants to the city.  Those cities that had favourable conditions for food production, combined with access to trade routes, were likely to develop into the capital cities of early Maya states.\nPremio Lo Nuestro 2003:Premio Lo Nuestro 2003 was the 15th anniversary of the awards.  the show was hosted by Mexican presenters Marco Antonio Regil and Adal Ramones.

It was part of the Spring Campaign, fought between 4 and 21 May 1849 and ended with the Hungarian capture of the castle by assault on 21 May.

At 21 May 1849, the same day with the capture of Buda, the two emperors: Franz Joseph I of Austria and tsar Nicholas I of Russia signed the final treaty which decided the involvement of 200 000 Russian soldiers (and a 80 000 strong reserve force, in the case that they were needed) in Hungary, in order to help the Habsburg Empire to crush the Hungarian revolution.\n\nAnswer:"

The term \"Similkameen District\" also refers to the Similkameen Mining District, a defunct government administrative district, which geographically encompasses the same area, and in more casual terms may also refer to the Similkameen electoral district, which was combined with the Grand Forks-Greenwood riding by the time of the 1966 election.  The Similkameen Country has deep historical connections to the Boundary Country and the two are sometimes considered one region, partly as a result of the name of the electoral district.  It is also sometimes classed as being part of the Okanagan region, which results from shared regional district and other administrative boundaries and names.

The ship was built at Hovedøen in Christiania under the direction of English shipbuilder James Robbins and was launched in 1650.  She was 51.8 meters long and at that time one of the largest naval vessels in the world.  She was commissioned by King Christian IV specifically to surpass the British ship  .  The ship was manned by a crew of 680 and had an armament of 108 guns, surpassing \"Sovereign of the Seas\" by eight guns.\nSophia Amalia Marschalk:Sophia Amalia Marschalk, also called Anna Marschalk, was a Danish noble and courtier.  She was the favorite of the queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark.\nJames Robbins (shipbuilder):James Robbins, died 1680, was an English shipbuilder in Danish service who built Sophia Amalia and other ships for the Danish navy.\nReconquest of Angola:The Reconquest of Angola (Portuguese: \"Reconquista de Angola\" ) (1641-1648) was Portugal's campaign to regain its colony in Angola from the Dutch.  In 1641 Johan Maurits sent an expedition under Admiral Cornelis Jol from Recife in Dutch Brazil to seize the Angolan capital of Luanda.  The Dutch were able to easily capture Luanda in August as the Portuguese forces were occupied inland in a campaign against the Kingdom of Kongo.  The two countries fought to a stalemate over Angola, until in 1648 the governor of Rio de Janeiro and Angola, Salvador de Sá, reached Luanda and finding the port defended by only 50 Dutch troops, regained it for Angola exactly seven years after its loss.\nFrance–United Kingdom relations:France–United Kingdom relations are the relations between the governments of the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK).  The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex, including conquest, wars, and alliances at various points in history.  The Roman era saw both areas, except Scotland and Northern Ireland, conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language.  In the medieval period, the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs claiming control over France.  The Hundred Years' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory.  Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815.  After that there were some tensions, but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed, the relationship became better.  Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale, particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II, wherein both countries fought against Germany, and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis.  Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO.  In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship, especially on defence and foreign policy issues; the two countries tend, however, to disagree on a range of other matters, most notably the European Union.  The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \"historic rivals\" or emphasize the perceived ever-lasting competition that still opposes the two countries.\nSaudi Arabia–United States relations:Bilateral relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States began in 1933 when full diplomatic relations were established.  Despite the differences between the two countries—an ultraconservative Islamic absolute monarchy, and a secular, democratic republic—the two countries have been allies.  In recent years, the two countries have occasionally been described as having a \"Special Relationship\" with one another.  Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi Royal Family.\nSoviet Union–United States relations:Soviet Union–United States relations: The relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922–1991) succeeded the previous relations from 1776 to 1917 and predate today's relations that began in 1992.  Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established late due to mutual hostility.  During World War II, the two countries were briefly allies.  At the end of the war, the first signs of post-war mistrust and hostility began to appear between the two countries, escalating into the Cold War; a period of tense hostile relations, with periods of détente.\nUruguay River pulp mill dispute:The pulp mill dispute was a dispute between Argentina and Uruguay concerning the construction of pulp mills on the Uruguay River.  The presidents at the time were Néstor Kirchner (Argentina) and Tabaré Vázquez (Uruguay).  As a diplomatic, economic, and public relations conflict between both parties, the dispute has also affected tourism and transportation as well as the otherwise amicable relations between the two countries.  The feud was unprecedented between the two countries, which have shared historical and cultural ties.  Proceedings were brought before the International Court of Justice as a case formally named Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay \"(Argentina v. Uruguay)\".  It ruled that, although Uruguay failed to inform Argentina of the operations, it did not pollute the river, so closing the pulp mill would be unjustified.  The conflict ended in 2010, during the presidencies of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Argentina) and José Mujica (Uruguay), with the establishment of a joint coordination of the activities in the river.\nMalawi–Mozambique relations:Malawi–Mozambique relations refers to the current and historical relationship between the countries of Malawi and Mozambique.  As Malawi shares a large border with Mozambique, much of the substance of their foreign relations pertain to the border separating the two nations.  Both of the sovereign states have amicably agreed that lacustrine borders on Lake Malawi remain the largest priority between the two countries, as the exploitation of natural resources within the waters of Lake Malawi remain an issue the two countries continue to resolve.  The moment considered an act of generosity and sympathy within the two countries relations is when, during the Mozambique Civil War, Malawi housed over one million Mozambican refugees between 1985 and 1995.  After this gesture, Malawian relations with Mozambique crumbled under the tenure of Bingu wa Mutharika, notoriously reaching a nadir when Malawian police launched a raid into Mozambique's territory.\nCovered interest arbitrage:Covered interest arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the interest rate differential between two countries by using a forward contract to \"cover\" (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk.  Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks to make use of the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates.  The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold.  When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return.  Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered interest arbitrage opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage trading strategies.\n\nAnswer:"

Progress M-18M was sent on a 4-Orbit rendezvous profile that was already demonstrated by the Progress M-16M and Progress M-17M spacecraft in 2012.\nSalyut 6:Salyut 6 (Russian: Салют-6 ; lit.  Salute 6), DOS-5, was a Soviet orbital space station, the eighth flown as part of the Salyut programme.  Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station was the first of the 'second-generation' type of space station.  Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary advances over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design.  These included the addition of a second docking port, a new main propulsion system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope.  The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time.  The early Salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage (aside from the limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their Soyuz spacecraft), nor could the propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply.  Consequently, once the consumables launched with the station were used up, its mission had to be concluded and as a result, manned missions had a maximum duration of three months.  Progress spacecraft could now bring fresh supplies and propellant and also be used to dispose of waste, which was then destroyed once the spacecraft was deorbited.\n\nAnswer:"

During this period, Yusuf employed only the use of voice and drums in recording these songs, due to a lack of consensus amongst the Islamic community regarding whether the use of musical instruments were permitted.  Other than the songs written, Yusuf recorded nasheeds, spoken word, and Muslim prayers, as with the traditional call to prayer, the Aḏhān.

One of the most fearsome and devastating hitters of his era, he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991–1997) with a .300 batting average and at least 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks and 20 home runs; over that period, he batted .330 and averaged 36 home runs and 118 RBI per year.  A perennial MVP candidate through the 1990s, he was named the AL's Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in 1993 after becoming the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs, leading the team to a division title; he repeated as MVP in the strike-shortened 1994 season after batting .353 and leading the league in slugging average and runs.  After two subpar seasons, he lost the MVP in a close vote in 2000 after posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI, also earning AL Comeback Player of the Year honors, as Chicago finished with the AL's best record.\nList of Major League Baseball batting champions:In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.\n1921 Detroit Tigers season:The 1921 Detroit Tigers finished in sixth place in the American League, 27 games behind the Yankees, with a record of 71–82.

Detroit outfielders Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb finished No. 1 and No. 2 in the American League batting race with batting averages of .394 and .389, and all three Detroit outfielders (Heilmann, Cobb, and Bobby Veach) ranked among the league leaders in batting average and RBIs.  As early proof of the baseball adage that \"Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting\", the downfall of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching.  The team ERA was 4.40, they allowed nine or more runs 28 times, and only one pitcher (Dutch Leonard) had an ERA below 4.24.\nDick Kauffman:Howard Richard \"Dick\" Kauffman (June 22, 1888 – April 16, 1948) was a professional baseball player whose career spanned 11 seasons, two of which were spent in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the St. Louis Browns (1914–15).

Primary school and other comprehensive or compulsory education is free in many countries, for example, and all education is mostly free (often not including books (from primary) and a number of administrative and sundry fees in university) including post-graduate studies in the Nordic countries.  The Article 13 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensures the right to free education at primary education and progressive introduction of it at secondary and higher education as the right to education.  From 2013 in Northern Europe, Estonia started providing free higher education as well.  In Argentina, Norway and Finland, no fees apply for foreign students enrolling at a university, although they may not be eligible for a monthly study allowance and loan.  Bachelor's degree programmes in Norway are solely taught in Norwegian.  Master's degree programmes in Norway are offered in either Norwegian or English depending on the programme or university.  Sweden, until the early-21st century, provided free education to foreign students but changes have been introduced to charge fees to foreign students from outside of the European community.  Denmark also has universal free education, and provides a monthly stipend, the \"Statens Uddannelsesstøtte\" or \"SU\", to students over 18 years of age or students who are under 18 and attending a higher education.

His main show rivalry was with a dog named Tartar, and along with a dog named Trap, the three were popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed.  He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds.\nPoi Dog Pondering:Poi Dog Pondering is an American musical group, noted for its cross-pollination of diverse musical genres, including various forms of acoustic and electronic music.  Founded in Hawaii in 1984 by Frank Orrall, initially as a solo project.  In 1985 Orrall formed the first line-up of PDP to perform its first concert; at the Honolulu Academy of Arts.  The band then embarked on a yearlong Street Performance Busking tour across North America, eventually settling in Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums.  In 1992, the band relocated, this time to Chicago, Illinois, where they began to incorporate Orchestral arrangements & elements of Electronic, House Music and Soul music into their Acoustic Rock style.  The membership of Poi Dog Pondering has changed from album to album.\nTeddy Roosevelt Terrier:The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.\n\nAnswer:"

The leader of the organization was Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven D. Bundy, who engaged in a standoff with the federal government over grazing rights on federal land.\nCliven Bundy:Cliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff.  He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach.  He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees.  Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts.  Some considered him to be dangerously provocative.  He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.\nForage value index:The Forage Value Index is a derived index of the relative change in the previous year’s average monthly rate per head for pasturing cattle on privately owned land in the West.  Used in calculating federal grazing fees.\nMaintenance fee (EPA):In United States environmental policy, maintenance fees are the annual fees paid by pesticide manufacturers and formulators to continue registration of pesticide active ingredients and products with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The fees supplement funds appropriated from general U.S. revenues, which cover most administrative costs of the EPA pesticide program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136a-1).  Fees are deposited into a separate Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to offset costs associated with EPA reregistration activities and expedited processing of pesticide registrations that are substantially similar to registrations already in effect or which are for public health pesticides, as defined in FIFRA Section 2(nn).  Congress mandated collection of an annual maintenance fee from each pesticide registrant in 1988 amendments to (P.L. 100-532).  EPA has authority to cancel a registration if a registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee.\nSentinel Offender Services:In 2012, James Hucks filed suit against Sentinel Offender Services after an arrest warrant was issued for his wife because she did not pay all the fees she owed to the company during her probation.  In 2013, Georgia judge Daniel J. Craig ruled that Sentinel had to refund hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who had paid them, and that private probation companies cannot collect fees from probationers after their probation has expired.  Later that year, Craig granted Sentinel a stay on this ruling, but, despite their attempts to persuade him to back down on it, refused to undo his restrictions.  In 2012, Georgia man Tom Barrett stole a can of beer and was later put on probation with Sentinel after being unable to pay a US$200 fine.  He was later put in jail for two months after being unable to pay Sentinel's startup fee.  As of May 2015, Barrett was suing Sentinel, and was being represented by Augusta attorney Jack Long.  On February 17, 2016, the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a lawsuit against Sentinel on behalf of two women from Cleveland, Georgia who were sentenced to 12 months probation each for not paying fines; the lawsuit also claims both women were told they had to undergo drug tests by a probation officer.\nEnglish rule (attorney's fees):In the field of law and economics, the English rule (capitalized as English Rule in some jurisdictions) is a rule controlling assessment of attorneys' fees arising out of litigation.  The English rule provides that the party who loses in court pays the other party's attorney's fees.  The English rule contrasts with the American rule, under which each party is generally responsible to pay its own attorneys' fees, unless a statute or contract provides for that assessment.  The rationale for the English rule is that a litigant (whether bringing a claim or defending a claim) is entitled to legal representation and, if successful, should not be left out of pocket by reason of his or her own legal fees.  It should be borne in mind that, in virtually all English civil litigation, damages are merely compensatory.\nList of golf courses in The Villages:One of the key advertising campaigns of The Villages is that residents are able to play \"free golf for life\".  The advertising is only partially true; the \"free golf\" is paid for by mandatory amenities fees assessed to all homeowners in The Villages.  The \"free golf\" extends only to the executive golf courses and only to players walking the courses, wherein a greens fee is not assessed.  Players riding golf carts on executive courses pay no greens fee but must pay a trail fee.  Greens fees and trail fees are required on The Villages country club courses (though memberships are provided \"free\" – again, as part of the amenities fee – to residents).\nStealth inflation:Stealth inflation is a type of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers.  The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract.  The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional.  Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue.  A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and installation fees.  Another form of stealth inflation is devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency.  The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.\nUniversal transit pass:Universal Transit Pass or Universal Access Transit Pass (U-Pass) is a program that gives students enrolled in participating post-secondary institutions unlimited access to local transit.  Programs are either funded through mandatory fees that eligible students pay in each term in which they are registered or included in the students' tuition.  For example, the University of Washington and the U-Pass program in Chicago have mandatory U-Pass fees.  Fees are transferred to the local transit authority to fund the required transit service.  Because fees are collected from a large participant base, U-Pass prices are lower than the amount students would otherwise pay for monthly passes or tickets over the course of a term.  The U-Pass price charged to students depends on a variety of factors which differ among municipalities, transit systems and post-secondary institutions.\n\nAnswer:"

Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular), and has long been played at festival-like settings.  It encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day.  The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) era, played at early music festivals; the common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1830), and Romantic eras (1804–1910), which included opera festivals and choral festivals; and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary classical music festivals or postmodern (1975–2000) eras, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century.  The term \"classical music\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age.\nCanadian classical music:In Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education.\nList of Indian classical music festivals:The following is an incomplete list of Indian classical music festivals, which encapsulates music festivals focused on Indian classical music.  The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the Vedas, which are the oldest scriptures in the Hindu tradition dating back to 1500 BC.  Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music.  There are two divisions in Indian classical music.  Hindustani music is mainly found in North India.  Carnatic music, from South India, tends to be more rhythdogs have bonessive and structured than Hindustani music.  While some festivals such as the Carnatic event Tyagaraja Aradhana (founded in the 1840s) continue to focus on traditional Carnatic classical music, an emergent trend of the past few decades has been that of fusion music, where genres such as khyal and western music are intermixed to appeal\nThe Friendly Guide to Music:The Friendly Guide to Music is a 'beginner's guide' to classical music, voiced by English actor and presenter Tony Robinson.  It covers the period from early music, Medieval and Renaissance music, to the modern era, 20th-century classical music, contemporary classical music, and 21st-century classical music, and its objective is to create a guide to music that is not needlessly complex.\nUK Classical Charts:The UK Classical Charts are three record charts based on classical music in the United Kingdom: the Classical Artist Albums Chart, the Classical Compilation Albums Chart and the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.  The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\nClassical music in Kosovo:Classical music in Kosovo refers to the art music cultivated in Kosovo.  The roots of classical music in Kosovo are found in the 1940s and include the time period from the times when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia to this day.  It can be said that there is a tradition of classical music in Kosovo, however, compared to other Balkan countries and especially European countries this tradition is younger.  Classical music in Kosovo reaches back about 70 years.  Even though in a short period of time, this music has evolved, passing through generations of composers and artists.  In his book \"Zhvillimi i stileve në veprat e kompozitorëve shqiptarë të Kosovës\", Engjëll Berisha comments:\nOdissi music:Odissi music (\"oṛiśī\") is a genre of classical music in India originated from the eastern state of Odisha.  Indian classical music has five significant branches: Avanti, Panchali, Odramagadhi, Hindustani and Carnatic.  Of these, Odramagadhi exists in the form of Odissi music.  Generally, Odissi is one of the classical dances of India performed with Odissi music.  Odissi music was shaped during the time of Oriya poet Jayadeva, who composed lyrics meant to be sung.  By the 11th century AD, folk music of Odisha in the form of Triswari, Chatuhswari, and Panchaswari was modified into the classical style.  However, Odissi songs were written even before the Oriya language developed.  Odissi music has a rich legacy dating back to the 2nd century BCE, when king Kharvela, the ruler of Odisha (Kalinga), patronized this music and dance.\nMusical composition:Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\nWomen in music:Women in music describes the role of women as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions.  As well, it describes music movements (e.g., women's music, which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to women, women's issues and feminism.  In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists.  Notable women artists in pop, such as Bjork and Lady Gaga have commented about sexism and gender discrimination in the music industry.  In classical music, although there have been a huge number of women composers from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the \"Concise Oxford History of Music\", Clara Schumann is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.\nKFAC (radio station):KFAC (radio station): KFAC was a commercial classical music radio station in Los Angeles, broadcasting for most of its life on 1330 kHz AM, and subsequently in both simulcast and separate programming on 92.3 MHz FM as well.  \"Only 41 of nearly 9,000 commercial radio stations in the United States play classical music\" and KFAC was considered one of the best.  On September 20, 1989 at 2 p.m., new owners changed both its name and its format, depriving Southern California of a major cultural institution.  During its heyday, the station was arguably the most important cultural organization in the Los Angeles area, having greater influence on lovers of classical music than even the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  Announcers such as John Conte, Howard Rhines, Dick Crawford, Thomas Cassidy, Carl Princi, Fred Crane, Steve Allen, Alfred Leonard, Tom Dixon, Bill Carlson, Dick Joy, Tom Franklin, Ed Stoddard, Bernie Alan, Rodger Layng, John Santana, Steve Markham and Doug Ordunio were featured on the station.  For several years, the station also carried the daily syndicated \"Adventures in Good Music\" with Karl Haas.  Other regularly scheduled programs were hosted by Leonora Schildkraut, Werner Klemperer, and Gussie Moran.\n\nAnswer:"

This condition occurs in about 10–20 babies in every million births in the United States.  Among this small group, cephalic conjoining, or craniopagus twinning, represents the rarest of congenital abnormalities, accounting for 2–6% of all conjoined twins.  Additionally, conjoined twins are genetically identical and always share the same sex.  The union in craniopagus twins may occur on any portion of the calvarium, but does not include either the face or the foramen magnum.  The thorax and abdomen are separate and each twin has its own umbilicus and umbilical cord.  The union may involve the entire diameter of the head or only a small portion.  This suggests that although there are many different kinds of variabilities already known in the scientific community, there are an infinite number of variations that can occur.  Most of these variations are based on the rotation of one twin's skull to the other and the different phenotypic sub-groups of craniopagus twins are based on all these rotational conformations.  Each of these factors (rotation, spot of union) affects the development of the brain, the vascular system within the brain and overall wellness of life both of the twins have outside the womb.  Relatively few craniopagus twins survive the perinatal period – approximately 40% of conjoined twins are stillborn and an additional 33% die within the immediate perinatal period, usually from organ abnormalities and failure.  However 25% of craniopagus twins survive and can be considered for a surgical separation and several attempts occur yearly worldwide.  In the last-half century , many advances in medicine including brain imaging, neuro-anaesthesia and neurosurgical techniques have proven that a successful outcome is possible following separation of total craniopagus twins.\nTwin Tower Sanctuary:Twin Tower Sanctuary (Old Sanctuary of the United Methodist Church) is a historic Methodist church building at 9967 W. 144th Street in Orland Park, Illinois.  The church was completed in 1898, six years after Orland Park was founded, to serve the city's large Methodist population.  Architect William Arthur Bennet, who later became well known for his Prairie School works, designed the church in the Queen Anne style.  The north side of the church is flanked by the two hexagonal towers that give the church its name.  The interior of the church has a Sullivanesque patterned tin ceiling; according to Louis Sullivan scholar Tim Samuelson, it is the best-preserved example of a Sullivanesque tin ceiling in the country.\n\nAnswer:"

Only one candidate has ever won an election, a 2002 race for the state senate, but that candidate (Thomas Wagoner) re-affiliated with the Republican Party the day after the election.  The Republican Moderate Party has extensive litigation-related history, due in no small part to its minor party status.  Previous cases have included ballot access rights and an early challenge to its name by the Republican Party of Alaska.  After a record of success in the 1990s, its support has slowly dwindled, ending with just 0.63% of the 2002 gubernatorial election.  State law requires that 3% of registered voters vote for a party or be registered to it for recognition.  A court challenge initially overturned this law, holding that it was more restrictive than what the state required of independent candidates, but resulted in the original law being upheld by the Alaska Supreme Court on the grounds that a party candidate has more impact than an independent candidate.  The party has since been recognized by the state again.  As of October 2010 there were 2,719 members statewide.\nSpanish general election, 1936:Legislative elections were held in Spain on 16 February 1936.

They commanded a narrow lead in terms of the popular vote, but a significant lead over the main opposition party, Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), of the political right in terms of seats.  The election had been prompted by a collapse of a government led by Alejandro Lerroux, and his Radical Republican Party.  Manuel Azaña would replace Manuel Portela Valladares, caretaker, as prime minister, after what were widely considered fair elections – although limited cases of electoral fraud did occur.  They were the last of three elections held during the Spanish Second Republic, coming three years after the 1933 general election which had brought the first of Lerroux's governments to power.  The poor result for the political right would help bring about the July coup, and the ensuing civil war.  The right-wing military coup initiated by Gens.  Sanjurjo and Franco ultimately brought about the end of parliamentary democracy in Spain until the 1977 general election.\nMalagasy presidential election, 1965:Presidential elections were held for the first time in Madagascar on 30 March 1965.

Founded in 1869 by primarily Americo-Liberians, the party dominated Liberian politics from 1878 until 1980.  The nation was virtually a one-party state, although opposition parties were never outlawed.  Initially, its ideology was strongly influenced by that of the United States Whig Party.\nLiberal Progressive Party:Liberal Progressive Party: The Eritrea for Eritreans Party (\"Ertra n'ertrawian\"), also known as th Liberal Progressive Party (LPP) was a political party in Eritrea.  The party was founded on February 18, 1947 in Adi Keyh.  It was a secular party dominated by Christians.  It opposed union with Ethiopia.  It called for the creation of an independent Tigrean state (uniting Tigrinya speakers in Eritrea and Ethiopia).  The party program accepted the notion of a U.S. trusteeship as intermediary step towards independence.

The Scottish Football Association, which governs the team, joined the international governing body FIFA in 1910, but along with the other Home Nations withdrew from FIFA in 1928.  This meant that Scotland did not participate in the World Cups of 1930, 1934 or 1938.  The Home Nations rejoined FIFA after the Second World War and Scotland then started to participate in international competitions.  Scotland have since participated in eight World Cups and two European Championship tournaments, but have never progressed beyond the first stage.

The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup.  The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.  The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson.  However, due to controversies of Qatar hosting, Australia's bid is possible if FIFA decides to strip Qatar's 2022 hosting rights.\n\nAnswer:"

Administratively, the territory of Kresy was composed of voivodeships of Lwów, Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisławów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Wołyń, and the Białystok.  Today, these territories are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with such major cities as Lviv, Vilnius, and Grodno no longer in Poland.  In the Second Polish Republic the term \"Kresy\" roughly equated with the lands beyond the so-called Curzon Line, which was suggested after World War I in December 1919 by the British Foreign Office as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Republic following the century of partitions.  In September 1939, after the Soviet Union joined Nazi Germany in their attack on Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the territories were incorporated into Soviet Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania in the atmosphere of terror.\nLingwai Daida:Lingwai Daida (), variously translated as \"Representative Answers from the Region beyond the Mountains\", \"Notes Answering [Curious Questions] from the land beyond the Pass\" or other similar titles, is a 12th century geographical treatise written by Zhou Qufei ().

Stevens was hunting in the area, and later found the first fragments of the meteorite while metal detecting on the crater rim.  The meteoritic nature of the fragments, and thus the authenticity of the crater, was confirmed by Dr. Chris Herd, professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta.  The area has been placed within a 200-metre by 200-metre protected zone, within which collecting is prohibited and subject to a $50,000 fine or one year in jail.  However, the vast majority of fragments have been found on Crown land beyond the protected area.\n\nAnswer:"

He was also the uncle of Frank Jack Fletcher, another U.S. Navy Admiral who also received the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz.\nHispanic Admirals in the United States Navy:Hispanic Admirals in the United States Navy can trace their tradition of naval military service to the Hispanic sailors, who have served in the Navy during every war and conflict since the American Revolution.  Prior to the Civil War, the highest rank reached by a Hispanic-American in the U.S. Navy was Commodore.  Such was the case of Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy (1792–1862), a Sephardic Jew of Hispanic descent and great grandson of Dr. Samuel Nunez, who served in the War of 1812.  During the American Civil War, the government of the United States recognized that the rapid expanding Navy was in need of admirals therefore, Congress proceeded to authorize the appointment of nine officers the rank of rear admiral.  On July 16, 1862, Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut became the first Hispanic-American to be appointed to the rank of rear admiral.  Two years later (1864), Farragut became a vice admiral, and in 1866 the Navy's first full admiral.  During World War I, Robert Lopez, the first Hispanic graduate of the United States Naval Academy, served with the rank of commodore in command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and during World War II five Hispanics served with the ranks of rear admiral or above in either the European or Pacific Theater's of the war.

Considered to have been a man of high ability and experience, he was given what was regarded as an impossible task of defending the Spanish Philippines with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. Asiatic Squadron.  Montojo became known for his defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey, being a decisive naval battle of the war.  After the conflict, the rear admiral was held accountable for the defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.\nFleet admiral (United States):Fleet admiral (abbreviated FADM), officially known as \"Fleet Admiral of the United States Navy\", is a five-star flag officer rank in the United States Navy.

In 1979 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nAnaïs Nin: A Biography:Anaïs Nin: A Biography is Deirdre Bair's award-winning biography of writer Anaïs Nin.  It is considered arguably by many to be the most comprehensive, well-researched, and scholarly biography available of Nin.  Though the biography has received praise, it has also angered some fans of Anaïs Nin as well as some of her former associates, some of whom claim that Bair's critical and rigorous investigation of Anaïs Nin's life is unsympathetic.\nSeduction of the Minotaur:Seduction of the Minotaur is an autobiographical novel by the mixed nationality writer Anaïs Nin, the last part of her \"Cities of the Interior\" sequence.  It is about a woman named Lillian, and her self-psychoanalysis.  The setting is taken from Anaïs' diary account of her first trip to Acapulco in 1947, and the novel repeats much of the first part of \"The Diary of Anaïs Nin\" volume V.  Since the author was concerned with psychology rather than physical adventure, there is actually less violence in the novel than in the diary account.  The exception is that the doctor allows himself to be shot because he is loved only as a doctor and never as a man, perhaps patterned after her understanding of Otto Rank's death.\nIncest: From a Journal of Love:Incest: From a Journal of Love: The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin (1932–1934) is a 1992 non-fiction book by Anaïs Nin.  It is a continuation of the diary entries first published in \"Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin\".  It features Nin's relationships with writer Henry Miller, his wife June Miller, the psychoanalyst Otto Rank, her father Joaquín Nin, and her husband Hugh Parker Guiler.  She also copied some of her correspondence with these people into her diary.  Much of this book was written in English, although those of her letters which were originally written in French and Spanish were translated.  Most of this diary takes place in France, particularly Clichy, Paris and Louveciennes.\nCollages (novel):Collages, published in 1964, was Anaïs Nin's last published novel (excluding her erotica).  It is very different from the previous novels of the \"Cities of the Interior\" series, because it contains none of the familiar characters in those novels.  It is also different in that it takes place on two continents, has about two dozen important characters, and for the first time in Anaïs Nin's work the female lead is not seeking psychological wholeness.  Most of Anaïs Nin's other novels only have a few main characters, there is rarely much geographical movement in the other novels, and usually the lead character is a woman seeking psychological wholeness.\nThe Diary of Anaïs Nin:The Diary of Anaïs Nin is the published version of Anaïs Nin's own private manuscript diary, which she began at age 11 in 1914 during a trip from Europe to New York with her mother and two brothers.  Anaïs Nin would later say she had begun the diary as a letter to her father, Cuban composer Joaquín Nin, who had abandoned the family a few years earlier.\nHouse of Incest:House of Incest is a slim volume of 72 pages written by Anaïs Nin.  Originally published in 1936, it is Anaïs Nin's first work of fiction.  But unlike her diaries and erotica, \"House of Incest\" does not detail the author's relationships with famous lovers like Henry Miller, nor does it contain graphic depiction of sex.  Rather, \"House of Incest\" is a surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or in Nin's words, as she attempts to escape from \"the woman's season in hell.\"\nNearer the Moon:Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love (full title \"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love, the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin (1937–1939)\") is a 1996 book based upon material excerpted from the unpublished diaries of Anaïs Nin.

This ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face \"prompt and utter destruction\".\nList of territories occupied by Imperial Japan:This is a list of regions occupied or annexed by the Empire of Japan until 1945, the end of World War II in Asia following the surrender of Japan.  Control over all territories except the Japanese mainland (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and some 6000 small surrounding islands) was renounced by Japan in the Unconditional Surrender after World War II and the Treaty of San Francisco.  A number of territories occupied by the United States (the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) after 1945 have been returned to Japan, see Japan–United States relations for details.

The German garrison's surrender on 6 May was followed by the surrender of all German forces two days after the battle.\nSoviet–Japanese War:The Soviet–Japanese War (Russian: Советско-японская война ; Japanese: ソ連対日参戦 , \"Soviet Union entry into war against Japan\") was a military conflict within the Second World War beginning soon after midnight on August 9, 1945, with the Soviet invasion of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.  The Soviets and Mongolians terminated Japanese control of Manchukuo, Mengjiang (Inner Mongolia), northern Korea, Karafuto, and the Chishima Islands.  The defeat of Japan's Kwantung Army helped in the Japanese surrender and the termination of World War II.  The Soviet entry into the war was a significant factor in the Japanese government's decision to surrender unconditionally, as it made apparent the Soviet Union would no longer be willing to act as a third party in negotiating an end to hostilities on conditional terms.\nGeneral Quarters (rules):General Quarters is a set of naval wargaming rules written by Lonnie Gill.  Quick and easy to play they have become one of the most popular series of World War I and World War II era naval rules (they topped the poll of popular wargames rules amongst the Naval Wargames Society.  There are currently three versions available.  GQ1 covered World War II and used a d6 based system.  GQ2 expanded coverage to World War I whilst also introducing new rules for World War II games; it also introduced a revised combat system that used a d10 in addition to d6.  GQ3 was a complete revision published in 2006.  A revised World War I version was announced for release in September 2007, and published as Fleet Action Imminent . There are a number of campaign supplements for GQ3.  First is The Solomons Campaign about the World War II Guadalcanal battles.  Next is Sudden Storm a hypothetical campaign dealing with a war, between Japan and the US in 1937.  A surprisingly possible occurrence, and one that yields a lot of big gun battles as the US fights its way back across the Pacific to the Philippines.  All in a very smooth and playable format.\n\nAnswer:"

It was nominated for California Music Awards in 1997 and 1998.  Selections from the album were used on an NBC Hard Copy segment on Absinthe.\nList of alcoholic drinks:This is a list of alcoholic drinks.  An alcoholic drink is a drink that contains ethanol, commonly known as alcohol.  Alcoholic drinks are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and distilled beverages.  They are legally consumed in most countries, and over one hundred countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption.  In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them.  This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink.  Most nations set it at 18 years of age.\nRakı:Rakı is an unsweetened, occasionally (depending on area of production) anise-flavored, alcoholic drink that is popular in Albania, Turkey, Greece (where it is distinctly different and comes as an unflavoured distillate, unlike its Turkish counterpart), Iran, Turkic countries, and in the Balkan countries as an apéritif.  It is often served with seafood or meze.  It is similar to several other alcoholic beverages available around the Mediterranean and the Middle East, e.g. pastis, ouzo, sambuca, arak, Aragh Sagi and aguardiente.  In Turkey and Greece, it is considered a national drink.\nMarskin ryyppy:Marskin ryyppy (lit.  \"The Marshal's drink/shot\"; Swedish: \"Marskens snaps\" ) is a strong alcoholic drink of Finnish origin, served as a schnapps.  The drink is named after Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the Marshal of Finland.  According to all sources it is important that the glass where the drink is served is poured as full as possible (to the point where surface tension keeps some of the drink in the glass); the glass is then to be emptied without spilling.  This practice is said to originate in the Chevalier Guard where Mannerheim once served; every man was entitled one shot of Vodka per day, and through this practice everyone was assured the equal maximum amount.  Marskin ryyppy must also be served ice-cold.\nArak (drink):Arak or araq (Arabic: عرق‎ ‎ ) is a Levantine alcoholic spirit (~40–63% Alc.  Vol. /~80–126 proof, commonly 50% Alc.  Vol. /100 proof) in the anis drinks family.  It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink.  The Persian (Iranian) version of Arak (commonly called Arak Saggi) does not contain anise, as it is usually produced from ‌raisins, dates or saccharum plant.  Arak is the traditional alcoholic beverage in the Arab world, especially in the Levant/Mashriq and also in the Maghreb, as well in Iran and Turkey.\nAbsinthe:Absinthe ( or ; French: ] ) is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage.  It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of \"Artemisia absinthium\" (\"grand wormwood\"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless.  It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \"\"la fée verte \"\" (the green fairy).  Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit.  Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.\nCaffeinated alcoholic drink:A caffeinated alcoholic drink, or caffeinated alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains both alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) and caffeine.  They often include the ingredients of energy drinks as well.  In 2010 and 2011, this type of beverage faced criticism for posing health risks to their drinkers.  In some places there is a ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages.\nZurracapote:Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangría.  It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon.  The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts.  The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangría.\nCundill Prize:The Cundill Prize in Historical Literature (or simply Cundill Prize) was founded in 2008 by Peter Cundill to recognize and promote literary and academic achievement in history.  The prize is presented annually to an author who has published a non-fiction book in the prior year that is likely to have profound literary, social, and academic impact in the area of history.  At a value of $75,000 U.S., the Grand Prize is claimed to be the richest non-fiction historical literature prize in the world.  In addition, two \"Recognition of Excellence\" prizes of $10,000 U.S. each are awarded.  The winners of the Prizes are selected by an independent jury of at least five internationally qualified individuals selected by McGill University.  The Cundill Prize in History at McGill is administered by McGill University's Dean of Arts, with the help of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC).\nTempore:Tempore (abbreviated to temp.)  in historical literature denotes a period during which a person whose exact lifespan is unknown was known to have been alive or active, or some other date which is not exactly known, usually given as the reign of a monarch.  The word is Latin, being the ablative singular of the noun \"tempus, temporis\", \"time\", thus meaning \"in the time (of)\".  It should be followed by a name in the genitive case.  The theoretical full form might be \"vixit tempore Regis Henrici Primi\" (\"he/she lived in the time of King Henry the First\") (i.e. 1100-1135).  The best known occurrence is in the Domesday Book of 1086, where the phrase \"Tempore Regis Eduardi\" (nominative case \"Rex Eduardus\"), meaning \"in the time of King Edward (the Confessor)\" appears in the entry for almost every manor, abbreviated as TRE.  It thus signifies the date range 1042–1066.  It is useful in historical literature because the names of many historical persons appear in surviving documents only in royal charters, possibly as witnesses, which can be dated to the reign of the originating monarch.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:The Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz is associated with what type of realism?\nDocs:Carl von Clausewitz:Carl Philipp Gottfried (or Gottlieb) von Clausewitz ( ; 1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831) was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the \"moral\" (meaning, in modern terms, psychological) and political aspects of war.  His most notable work, \"Vom Kriege\" (\"On War\"), was unfinished at his death.\nClassical realism (international relations):Classical Realism is a theory of International Relations established in the post-World War II era that seeks to explain international politics as a result of human nature.  The theory is associated with thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes.  Modern thinkers associated with classical realism are Carl von Clausewitz, Hans Morgenthau and Reinhold Niebuhr.  Classical Realist thought has since been overshadowed by Neorealism after Kenneth Waltz' work became more widely accepted due to the rise of Structuralism in North American International Relations scholarship which favored the latter's emphasis on rationality rather than human nature as cause for political conflict.\nOn War:Vom Kriege (] ) is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831), written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife Marie von Brühl in 1832.  It has been translated into English several times as On War.  \"On War\" is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task.  His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835.  His 10-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the Prussian state.  \"On War\" is formed by the first three volumes and represents his theoretical explorations.  It is one of the most important treatises on political-military analysis and strategy ever written, and remains both controversial and an influence on strategic thinking.\nAugust Otto Rühle von Lilienstern:August Otto Rühle von Lilienstern, born 1780, died 1847.  Prussian officer, joined Scharnhorst's Academy for Officers in the same class as Carl von Clausewitz.  Later, they both taught at the Prussian General War School, which would become the Prussian War Academy, and Rühle became Clausewitz' second successor as its director.  Rühle published many articles, kept official war diaries, and wrote a two-volume \"Manual for the Officer for Education in Peace and for Use in Action\" (\"Handbuch für den Offizier zur Belehrung im Frieden und zum Gebrauch im Felde\"), published in Berlin in 1817 and 1818.  Lilienstern and Clausewitz, teaching at the same school at the time of publication of this manual, were in agreement on many points.  For example, they agreed that war was political in nature (which was neither a novel nor a controversial idea) and that war was a \"Zweikampf.\"  (That is, literally a \"two-struggle,\" usually translated into English as \"duel,\" though in fact the imagery and metaphor that Clausewitz pursued was a wrestling match.)  Clausewitz made these ideas famous in his book On War.  Their common views on such issues can be traced to the nature of the military intellectual community in Prussia and the common influence of Scharnhorst.\nChristopher Bassford:Christopher Bassford (born 1953) is an American military historian, best known for his works on the Prussian military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz.  Bassford graduated from the College of William and Mary with a degree in history and honors for his dissertation on tactical nuclear weapons and completed his MA in American diplomatic history at Ohio University.  Subsequent to receiving his MA, he served five years on active duty as a U.S. Army field artillery officer, with tours in Korea and Germany.  He completed a Ph.D. in modern European history at Purdue University and became director of studies in the theory and nature of war at the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Command and Staff College, then associate professor of National Policy Issues at the U.S. Army War College.  He was Professor of Strategy at the National War College (NWC), in Washington, D.C., from 1999 until 2012, when he joined the faculty of the College of International Security Affairs (CISA) as part of the JSOMA program supporting U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  He is the webeditor of The Clausewitz Homepage, a large educational website that has been on-line since 1995.\nAbsolute war:The concept of absolute war was a theoretical construct developed by the Prussian military theorist General Carl von Clausewitz in his famous but unfinished philosophical exploration of war, \"Vom Kriege\" (in English, \"On War\", 1832).  It is discussed only in the first half of Book VIII (there are only a couple of references to it elsewhere) and it does not appear in sections of the text written later.  This indicates that it was an experiment that failed and was meant to be dropped.\nPanzer Division Clausewitz:Panzer Division Clausewitz: Panzer-Division \"Clausewitz\" was a German panzer division during World War II, named for Carl von Clausewitz.\nBattle of Wavre:The Battle of Wavre was the final major military action of the Hundred Days campaign and the Napoleonic Wars.

A blocking action, this battle kept 33,000 French soldiers from reaching the Battle of Waterloo and so helping in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\nCharles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame:The Charles S. Roberts Awards Hall of Fame, formally known as the Clausewitz Award Hall of Fame, is named after legendary military writer Carl von Clausewitz.

The book analyzes the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) in terms of Carl von Clausewitz's theory of war, arguing that modern counter-insurgencies have more in common with domestic political struggles than the traditional state-on-state conflicts described by Clausewitz.  The book was favorably reviewed by Michael Howard, a prominent military historian, among others.\n\nAnswer:"

Active in Augsburg, he was the second-eldest son of Ulrich Fugger the Elder and Veronika Lauginger.  In 1516 he married Veronika Gassner.  He was a successful businessman and his uncle Jakob Fugger planned that he would be his successor at the head of the family firm, though Ulrich the Younger died before this could happen - Ulrich's will passed over his younger brother Hieronymus as unsuitable for the succession (their elder brother Hans had died in 1515), so Jakob's eventual successor was another nephew, Anton Fugger.\nOtto F.

Walter last appears in the historical record in 1136 and died without children.  His lands went to his nephew.\nTitta Ruffo:Titta Ruffo (9 June 1877 - 5 July 1953), born as Ruffo Titta Cafiero, was an Italian operatic baritone who had a major international singing career.  Known as the \"Voce del leone\" (\"voice of the lion\"), he was greatly admired, even by rival baritones, such as Giuseppe De Luca, who said of Ruffo: \"His was not a voice, it was a miracle\" (although not often published is the second part of De Luca's conclusion \"...which he [Ruffo] bawled away...\"), and Victor Maurel, the creator of Verdi's Iago and Falstaff.  Maurel said that the notes of Ruffo's upper register were the most glorious baritone sounds he had ever heard (see Pleasants, cited below).  Indeed Walter Legge, the prominent classical record producer, went so far as to call Ruffo \"a genius\".\nWalter Hearne:Walter Hearne (15 January 1864 – 2 April 1925) was an English cricketer for Kent CCC.  He was the elder brother of the great Middlesex bowler J.T.Hearne and was a bowler of somewhat similar style, being a medium paced right-hander with great accuracy and a pronounced off-break.  However, unlike his younger sibling, Walter Hearne was not physically robust and suffered throughout his short career from knee problems, which ultimately led to his giving up the game at for the time a very young age.  Also, even in his best season, Walter Hearne did not demonstrate that he possessed John Thomas’ sting on a firm pitch: indeed on the best wicket he had to bowl during 1894 at the Oval, he was severely punished taking only two wickets for 129.  There was, however, no denying his deadliness on sticky wickets: in one spell during 1894 he took in three games thirty-eight wickets for 241 runs, including thirteen for 98 against Surrey at Catford.  Walter Hearne's cricket basically began and ended with his bowling: prior to making a score of 34 not out in his last-ever match his highest score had been only 22, and he was not a strong field as his more famous brother was.\nHans Bocksberger der Ältere:Hans Bocksberger was born in Mondsee, the son of Ulrich and Anna Bocksberger.

There can be esophoria, where the eyes tend to cross inward in the absence of fusion; exophoria, in which they diverge; or hyperphoria, in which one eye points up or down relative to the other.  Phorias are known as 'latent squint' because the tendency of the eyes to deviate is kept latent by fusion.  A person with two normal eyes has single vision (usually) because of the combined use of the sensory and motor systems.  The motor system acts to point both eyes at the target of interest; any offset is detected visually (and the motor system corrects it).  Heterophoria only occurs during dissociation of the left eye and right eye, when fusion of the eyes is absent.  If you cover one eye (e.g. with your hand) you remove the sensory information about the eye's position in the orbit.  Without this, there is no stimulus to binocular fusion, and the eye will move to a position of \"rest\".  The difference between this position, and where it would be were the eye uncovered, is the heterophoria.  The opposite of heterophoria, where the eyes are straight when relaxed and not fusing, is called orthophoria.\n\nAnswer:"

The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar Nikolai Morozov (1854–1946), although work by French scholar Jean Hardouin (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.  However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians.  The concept is most fully explained in \"History: Fiction or Science?\" , originally published in Russian.\nNicolai V. Krylov:Nicolai Vladimirovich Krylov (Russian: Никола́й Влади́мирович Крыло́в ; born 5 June 1941) is a Russian mathematician specializing in partial differential equations, particularly stochastic partial differential equations and diffusion processes.  Krylov studied at Lomonosov University, where he in 1966 under E. B. Dynkin attained a doctoral candidate title (similar to a PhD) and in 1973 a Russian doctoral degree (somewhat more prestigious than a PhD).  He taught from 1966 to 1990 at the Lomonosov University and is since 1990 a professor at the University of Minnesota.  At the beginning of his career (starting from 1963) he, in collaboration with Dynkin, worked on nonlinear stochastic control theory, making advances in the study of convex, nonlinear partial equations of 2nd order (\"i.e.\" Bellman equations), which were examined with stochastic methods.  This led to the Evans-Krylov theory, for which he received with Lawrence C. Evans in 2004 the Leroy P. Steele Prize of the American Mathematical Society (for work done simultaneously and independently by both Krylov and Evans).  They proved the second order differentiability (Hölder continuity of the second derivative) of the solutions of convex, completely nonlinear, second order elliptical partial differential equations and thus the existence of \"classical solutions\" (Theorem of Evans-Krylov).  He was in 1978 at Helsinki and in 1986 at Berkeley an Invited Speaker for the ICM.  He received the Humboldt Research Award in 2001.  In 1993 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993).  He should not be confused with the mathematician Nikolay M. Krylov.\nDescribing function:In control systems theory, the describing function (DF) method, developed by Nikolay Mitrofanovich Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov in the 1930s, and extended by Ralph Kochenburger is an approximate procedure for analyzing certain nonlinear control problems.  It is based on quasi-linearization, which is the approximation of the non-linear system under investigation by a linear time-invariant (LTI) transfer function that depends on the amplitude of the input waveform.  By definition, a transfer function of a true LTI system cannot depend on the amplitude of the input function because an LTI system is linear.  Thus, this dependence on amplitude generates a family of linear systems that are combined in an attempt to capture salient features of the non-linear system behavior.  The describing function is one of the few widely applicable methods for designing nonlinear systems, and is very widely used as a standard mathematical tool for analyzing limit cycles in closed-loop controllers, such as industrial process controls, servomechanisms, and electronic oscillators.\nJubilee doctor:A jubilee doctor (Swedish: \"jubeldoktor\" , Latin: \"doctor jubilaris\" ) or golden doctor (German: \"Goldene Doktor\" ) is in some countries a person who has held a doctorate for 50 years or more.  When 50 years have passed, the doctor is invited again by his or her university to the ceremony where the doctorates are conferred and is made \"jubilee/golden doctor\" and celebrated as a guest of honour.  This custom is common in Germany, Sweden and Finland.  In Germany, this ceremony is referred to as the \"Golden Promotion\" (\"Goldene Promotion\").  In Sweden, a person so honoured who holds, for instance, a doctorate of philosophy, may use the academic title \"fil.jubeldr\" instead of the regular \"fil.dr\".\nDoctor (title):Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning.  The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb \"docēre \" ] 'to teach'.  It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris.  Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world.  Contracted \"Dr\" or \"Dr.\", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD).  In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree.\nAssociate professor:Associate professor (frequently capitalized as Associate Professor) is an academic title that can have different meanings.  In North America and universities elsewhere using the North American system, it is a position between assistant professor and a full professorship.  In some Commonwealth countries, the title associate professor is often used in place of reader, which is used in the United Kingdom and a number of other Commonwealth universities; this usage is typical of universities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in South Africa, India, parts of Southeast Asia, Ireland and other countries.  The title associate professor in those countries, like the title reader, corresponds to a full professorship in North America.\nGeorgian International Academy:Georgian International Academy: Georgian International Academy (Georgian: საქართველოს საერთაშორისო აკადემია ) is a research and academic institution located in Tbilisi, Georgia.

The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration, and is equivalent to the Ph.D in Business Administration.  Along with the Ph.D, it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration.  Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D in Business Administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university professor or postdoctoral researcher in the field.  As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title doctor, which is often represented via the English honorific \"Dr.\" or the post-nominal letters \"D.B.A.\", \"DBA\", \"Dr.B.A.\" , or \"DrBA\".\nMaster of Music:The Master of Music (M.M. or M.Mus.)  is, as an academic title, the first graduate degree in Music awarded by universities and conservatories.  The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy.  The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization.  The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions.\n\nAnswer:"

It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest.

In the present era, Fertit is a catch-all word for non-Dinka, non-Arab, non-Luo, non-Fur groups of the state of Western Bahr el Ghazal in South Sudan.

Little is known about his brief rule, it does not appear in the sources that the Burmese were at the origin of his selection to succeed Sen Soulintha and were instead informed belatedly.  If he had supporters in the royal court of Lan Xang they were few and quickly became unhappy with his rule.  Within the year the royal court had petitioned King Nanda Bayin for his removal.  According to various versions of the chronicles it is cited that Nakhon Noi “did not rule with fairness,” or keep to the religious and behavioral precepts which were traditionally required by a sovereign.  Other versions record that he simply had made enemies at court, or was perceived as illegitimate because (like his father Sen Soulintha) he was of common origins.

After Nakhon Noi was deposed a period of interregnum occurred from 1583-1591 which historian Paul Le Boulanger describes as a period of “absolute confusion,” among the factions at court.  The chronicles again agree that it was only after the period of succession crisis that a petition was finally sent in 1591 to Nanda Bayin by the Lao sangha and Lan Xang court asking for Prince No Muang, the son and legitimate heir of Setthathirath, to be appointed as king.

The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business.  Keyman Insurance policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity.  Key person insurance does not indemnify the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified on the insurance policy.\n\nAnswer:"

It is in the Archdiocese of Detroit.  Its current priest is Rev. Phillip Ching.  When the parish was first established, the mayor of Monroe palatial residence was remodeled as a temporary church.  It was used as a church on the first floor and on the second it was used for the school.  Later it would only be used as St. Michael School.  Then in 1866 the cornerstone for the present church was laid.  The large 187 foot steeple wasn't added until 1883.  In 1874 the 3-story rectory was built east of the church.  In 1918 the parish built the present building of St. Michael School which is now a part of Monroe Catholic Elementary Schools.  The movement to establish the parish started in 1845 by 14 German immigrants who wanted to worship in their native language.  The only nearby church was St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception right across the river where St. Michael stands today.  St. Mary's only worshiped in French and wouldn't hold services in other languages like German and Irish.  The German and Irish families were forced to move to the second floor of the rectory to have mass in their native languages.  When the German families were able to acquire land they were eager to leave St. Mary's to start a parish of their own.  They first purchased an empty lot Humphrey Street but the plan was soon abandoned.  They then purchased the first mayor of Monroe's estate to build the church and it remains the current site of the church.\nHaliaetum:Haliaetum was a Roman port that stood in the area of Simon Bay, next to the nowaday's village of Jagodje, on the northern Adriatic coast of the Istrian peninsula.

The site is also open to tourists.  The port was first established around 178-177BC following fierce resistance by the Histri, the indigenous population.  It gave name to St. Mary of Haliaetum Church (Slovene: \"cerkev sv.  Marije Alietske\" ) in Izola, the coastal town just southwest of Jagodje.  It was erected in the 11th century and was later redesigned in the Baroque style.\n\nAnswer:"

Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.1 despite only playing 38 games due to ACL injury.  The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway.  The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2004–05 season.  This season would mark the end of the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett era in Boston as they were traded to the Brooklyn Nets during the 2013 off-season.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:When was  Evelyn Waugh famous work first published \nDocs:A Handful of Dust:A Handful of Dust is a novel by the British writer Evelyn Waugh.  First published in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous in the pre-World War II years.  Commentators have, however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic postwar fiction.\nDecline and Fall:Decline and Fall is a novel by the English author Evelyn Waugh, first published in 1928.  It was Waugh's first published novel; an earlier attempt, titled \"The Temple at Thatch\", was destroyed by Waugh while still in manuscript form.  \"Decline and Fall\" is based in part on Waugh's schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales.  It is a social satire that employs the author's characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s.\nThe Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold:The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is a novel by the British writer Evelyn Waugh, first published in July 1957.  It is Waugh's penultimate full-length work of fiction, which the author called his \"mad book\"—a largely autobiographical account of a period of hallucinations caused by bromide intoxication that he experienced in the early months of 1954, recounted through his protagonist Gilbert Pinfold.\nThe Temple at Thatch:The Temple at Thatch was an unpublished novel by the British author Evelyn Waugh, his first adult attempt at full-length fiction.  He began writing it in 1924 at the end of his final year as an undergraduate at Hertford College, Oxford, and continued to work on it intermittently in the following 12 months.  After his friend Harold Acton commented unfavourably on the draft in June 1925, Waugh burned the manuscript.  In a fit of despondency from this and other personal disappointments he began a suicide attempt before experiencing what he termed \"a sharp return to good sense\".\nThe Comforters:The Comforters: The Comforters is the first novel by Scottish author Muriel Spark.  She drew on experiences as a recent convert to Catholicism and having suffered hallucinations due to using Dexedrine, an amphetamine then available over the counter for dieting.  Although completed in late 1955, the book was not published until 1957.  A mutual friend, novelist Alan Barnsley, had sent the proofs to Evelyn Waugh.  At the time Waugh was writing \"The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold,\" which dealt with his own drug-induced hallucinations.\nSword of Honour:The Sword of Honour trilogy by Evelyn Waugh consists of three novels, \"Men at Arms\" (1952), \"Officers and Gentlemen\" (1955) and \"Unconditional Surrender\" (1961, published as \"The End of the Battle\" in the US), which loosely parallel Waugh's experiences in the Second World War.  Waugh received the 1952 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for \"Men at Arms\".\nVirginia Sorensen:Virginia Sorensen, née Eggertsen, also credited as Virginia Sorenson (February 17, 1912, in Provo, Utah – December 24, 1991), was the author of the 1957 John Newbery Medal winning \"Miracles on Maple Hill\", based in the Erie, Pennsylvania region where she lived at the time.  She grew up in Manti and American Fork, Utah.  Her first novel, \"A Little Lower Than the Angels\", was written and published in 1942 while she resided in Terre Haute, Indiana, with her first husband Frederick C. Sorensen, a professor at Indiana State Teachers College, now Indiana State University.  With its publication, Alfred Knopf declared, \"I have seldom introduced a new novelist with the confidence I feel in the author of this remarkable book.  It marks the debut, I believe, of a major American writer.\"  She is considered \"one of Utah's premiere gifts to literary America.\"  Her first book for children, \"Curious Missy\", grew out of her efforts with a bookmobile in Alabama.  She later divorced Sorensen and married Alec Waugh, son of Arthur Waugh and brother of Evelyn Waugh, in 1969.  Her books are usually Mormon-themed.  She received two Guggenheim fellowships, one in 1946 to study tribe of Mexican Indians, and one in 1954 to study in Denmark as regards the history of Sanpete Valley's settlers.\nAlec Waugh:Alexander Raban \"Alec\" Waugh (8 July 1898 – 3 September 1981), was a British novelist, the elder brother of the better-known Evelyn Waugh and son of Arthur Waugh, author, literary critic, and publisher.  His first wife was Barbara Jacobs (daughter of the writer William Wymark Jacobs), his second wife was Joan Chirnside and his third wife was Virginia Sorenson, author of the Newbery Medal–winning \"Miracles on Maple Hill\".\nA Severe Mercy:A Severe Mercy is an autobiographical book by Sheldon Vanauken, relating the author's relationship with his wife, their friendship with C. S. Lewis, conversion to Christianity, and subsequent tragedy.  It was first published in 1977.  The book is strongly influenced, at least stylistically, by the Evelyn Waugh novel Brideshead Revisited.  It was followed by a sequel, \"Under the Mercy\", first published in 1985.\nLady Teresa Waugh:Lady Teresa Lorraine Waugh (\"née\" Onslow; born 26 February 1940) is a British novelist and translator.

It was released in the US only.  After the poor performance \"Nobody\" in the UK, there was a lot of dependence on \"Shoppin' From A to Z\" for its performance in the US, but the song failed to match the success of chart topper \"Mickey\", peaking at No. 77.

In 1990, she returned to Poland and began an association \"Nobody's Children\" to fight against child abuse in Poland.  She was the recipient of numerous awards and honors.\nInternational child abduction:The term international child abduction is generally synonymous with international \"parental kidnapping,\" \"child snatching\", and \"child stealing.\"  However, the more precise legal usage of \"international child abduction\" originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country.  In this context, \"illegal\" is normally taken to mean \"in breach of custodial rights\" and \"home\" is defined as the child's habitual residence.  As implied by the \"breach of custodial rights,\" the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application.  Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.\n\nAnswer:"

The name \"\"Joulupukki\"\" literally means \"Christmas goat\" or \"Yule Goat\" in Finnish; the word \"pukki\" comes from the Teutonic root \"bock\", which is a cognate of the English \"buck\", and means \"billy-goat\".  An old Scandinavian custom, the figure eventually became more or less conflated with Santa Claus.\nJoulutarina:Joulutarina (English title: \"Christmas Story\") is a 2007 Finnish christmas drama film directed by Juha Wuolijoki.  It is the story of how an orphan called Nikolas became Santa Claus.  The Finnish premiere was on 16 November 2007.  It was largely shot on location in Utsjoki.\nSanta Claus:Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa (Santy in Hiberno-English), is a legendary figure of Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved (\"good\" or \"nice\") children on Christmas Eve (24 December) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).  The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra, the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of \"Sinterklaas\" (himself also based on Saint Nicholas).  Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan, who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky.\nMikulás:Mikulás (or Szent Miklós) is the Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, and a similar figure to Santa Claus.  In many cities, Mikulas is getting more conflated with Santa Claus.  Still, it is believed that Mikulas arrives to celebrate his day, December 6, and leaves before Christmas.  This tradition is also well known in Romania (\"Moș Nicolae\"), Slovenia (\"Miklavž)\", the Czech Republic, Slovakia (both Mikuláš), and Poland (\"Mikołaj\").\nSanta Claus in film:Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in \"Life Begins at Eight-thirty\" (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in \"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't\" (1966), Dan Aykroyd in \"Trading Places\" (1983), Jan Rubes in \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985), David Huddleston in \"\" (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1998), and Ed Asner in \"Elf\" (2003).  Later films about Santa vary, but can be divided into the following themes.\nYule Goat:The Yule goat is a Scandinavian and Northern European Yule and Christmas symbol and tradition.  Its origin may be Germanic pagan and has existed in many variants during Scandinavian history.  Modern representations of the Yule goat are typically made of straw.\nSanta Claus Is Comin' to Town (film):Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town is a 1970 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions.  The film stars Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles.  The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be.  It is based on the hit Christmas song \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\", which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\nChristmas stocking:Christmas stocking: A Christmas stocking is an empty sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Christmas Eve so that Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) can fill it with small toys, candy, fruit, coins or other small gifts when he arrives.  These small items are often referred to as stocking stuffers or stocking fillers.  In some Christmas stories, the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus; in other stories (and in tradition), some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree.  Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece or pile of coal.  However, coal is rarely if ever left in a stocking, as it is considered cruel.  Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep.\nA Miser Brothers' Christmas:A Miser Brothers' Christmas is a stop motion spin-off special based on some of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\".  Distributed by Warner Bros.  Animation under their Warner Premiere label (the rights holders of the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios, the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday, December 13, 2008, during the network's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming.  Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86.  Snow Miser, originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987, was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus, voiced by Shirley Booth in the original, was portrayed by Catherine Disher (because Booth had died in 1992).  The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style.  This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016.\nSanta Claus Park:Santa Claus Park is an attraction being developed near the community of Santa Claus, Indiana.  In 2005, a local development company purchased Santa's Candy Castle and other buildings that comprised Santa Claus Town and announced plans to restore and re-open them to the public.  Santa's Candy Castle was the first building of the original Santa Claus Town to be re-opened to the public, when its doors opened on July 1, 2006.  The 40-ton, 22-foot concrete Santa Claus statue was restored in 2011.  In 2012, a local historic church and the town's original post office were moved to the site next to the large Santa Claus statue.\n\nAnswer:"

It was created by Hugo Gernsback in February 1934 in the pages of \"Wonder Stories\", an early science fiction pulp magazine.  Gernsback was the League's \"Executive Secretary', with Charles D. Hornig its \"Assistant Secretary\".  The initial slate of \"Executive Directors\" included Forrest J. Ackerman, Eando Binder, Jack Darrow (Clifford Kornoelje), Edmond Hamilton, David H. Keller, P. Schuyler Miller, Clark Ashton Smith, and R. F. Starzl.\nScience Fiction Quarterly:Science Fiction Quarterly was an American pulp science fiction magazine that was published from 1940 to 1943 and again from 1951 to 1958.  Charles Hornig served as editor for the first two issues; Robert A. W. Lowndes edited the remainder.  \"Science Fiction Quarterly\" was launched by publisher Louis Silberkleit during a boom in science fiction magazines at the end of the 1930s.  Silberkleit launched two other science fiction titles (\"Science Fiction\" and \"Future Fiction) \"at about the same time: all three ceased publication before the end of World War II, falling prey to slow sales and paper shortages.  In 1950 and 1951, as the market improved, Silberkleit relaunched \"Future Fiction\" and \"Science Fiction Quarterly\".  By the time \"Science Fiction Quarterly\" ceased publication in 1958, it was the last surviving science fiction pulp.\nThe Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction:The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (usually referred to as F&SF) is a U.S. fantasy and science fiction magazine first published in 1949 by Fantasy House, a subsidiary of Lawrence Spivak's Mercury Press.  Editors Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak's existing mystery title, \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\".  The first issue was titled \"The Magazine of Fantasy\", but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue.  \"F&SF\" was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day, most of which were in pulp format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single column format, which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley \"set \"F&SF\" apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine\".\nVargo Statten Science Fiction Magazine:Vargo Statten Science Fiction Magazine (later Vargo Statten British Science Fiction Magazine, The British Science Fiction Magazine and The British Space Fiction Magazine) was a British science fiction magazine which published nineteen issues between 1954 and 1956.  It was initially published by Scion Press, with control passing to a successor company, Scion Distributors, after Scion went bankrupt in early 1954.  At the end of 1954, as part payment for a debt, Scion Distributors handed control of the magazine to Dragon Press, who continued it for another twelve issues.  E.C. Tubb and John Russell Fearn were regular contributors, and Kenneth Bulmer also published several stories in the magazine.  Barrington Bayley's first published story, \"Combat's End\", appeared in May 1954.  The editor was initially Alistair Paterson, but after seven issues Fearn took the helm: \"Vargo Statten\" was one of Fearn's aliases, and the magazine's title had been chosen because of his popularity.  Neither Paterson nor Fearn had enough of a budget to attract good quality submissions, and a printing strike in 1956 brought an end to the magazine's life.\nThe Best Science Fiction Stories: 1952:The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1952 is a 1952 anthology of science fiction short stories edited by Everett F. Bleiler and T. E. Dikty.  An abridged edition was published in the UK by Grayson in 1953 under the title \"The Best Science Fiction Stories: Third Series\".

A long-running feature was the series of interviews and autobiographical pieces with leading writers, entitled \"The Profession of Science Fiction\", a selection of which was edited and published by Macmillan Publishers in 1992.  Several issues have been themed, including #93 (\"A Celebration of British Science Fiction\", 2005), published also as part of the Foundation Studies in Science Fiction.

The boom was largely due to the rising demand from emerging markets such as the BRIC countries, particularly China during the period from 1992 to 2013, as well as the result of concerns over long-term supply availability.  There was a sharp down-turn in prices during 2008 and early 2009 as a result of the credit crunch and sovereign debt crisis, but prices began to rise as demand recovered from late 2009 to mid-2010.  Oil began to slip downwards after mid-2010, but peaked at $101.80 on 30 and 31 January 2011, as the Egyptian political crisis and rioting broke out, leading to concerns over both the safe use of the Suez Canal and overall security in Arabia itself.  On 3 March, Libya's National Oil Corp said that output had halved due to the departure of foreign workers.  As this happened, Brent Crude surged to a new high of above $116.00 a barrel as supply disruptions and potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa continued to worry investors.  Thus the price of oil kept rising into the 2010s.  The commodities super-cycle peaked in 2011, \"driven by a combination of strong demand from emerging nations and low supply growth.\"  Prior to 2002, only 5 to 10 per cent of trading in the commodities market was attributable to investors.  Since 2002 \"30 per cent of trading is attributable to investors in the commodities market\" which \"has caused higher price volatility.\"\nFounder Group:Founder Group () is a major Chinese technology conglomerate that deals with information technology, pharmaceuticals, real estate, finance, and commodities trading.

In a BPL, a group of European based banks (the pool), create a European firm whose sole purpose is to loan money to a US based company.  Because this loan to the European based bank is completely insured, the BPL does not have as high a risk if the loan is defaulted on.  Additionally, the pool actually makes more annual interest than if they were to loan money traditionally.  This allows US based firms to borrow as much as $10,000,000 completely interest free as long as it is backed by collateral of some sort (usually stock).  The Regulations require that the loan be of \"good value\" and so the newly formed European company usually requires securities to back the loan to pass this qualification.\n\nAnswer:"

He was a professor in Duisburg, Utrecht, and Leiden, where he held positions in mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy.  He is credited with the invention of the first capacitor in 1746: the Leyden jar.  He performed pioneering work on the buckling of compressed struts.  Musschenbroek was also one of the first scientists (1729) to provide detailed descriptions of testing machines for tension, compression, and flexure testing.  An early example of a problem in dynamic plasticity was described in the 1739 paper (in the form of the penetration of butter by a wooden stick subjected to impact by a wooden sphere).\nFranklin's electrostatic machine:Franklin's electrostatic machine is a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena.  Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad in contact with the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge.  Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.\nLeyden jar:A Leyden jar, or Leiden jar, is a device that \"stores\" static electricity between two electrodes on the inside and outside of a glass jar.  A Leyden jar typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil.  It was the original form of a capacitor (originally known as a \"condenser\").\nJar (unit):Jar (unit): A jar was an early unit of capacitance once used by the British Royal Navy.  The term originated as the capacitance of a Leyden jar.  Its value is such that one farad is jars and one jar is 1111 picofarads.\nFranklin bells:Franklin bells (also known as Gordon’s Bells or lightning bells) are an early demonstration of electric charge designed to work with a Leyden jar.

The technology is known to have led to 36 patent specifications in eleven countries.  He is also credited with the conceptualization of Swaraj farm tractor, a product of Punjab Tractors Ltd. and held another patent for his development of \"Railway truck wheel assembly\".  He received the fourth highest Indian civilian award of the Padma Shri in 1961.  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Engineering Sciences in 1962.  The Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi has instituted an annual award, \"Padmashri Manmohan Suri Project Award\", for honoring the best mechanical project by its alumni.\nThe Old Jar Craftsman:The Old Jar Craftsman (독짓는 늙은이 - \"Dokjinneun neulgeuni\") \"aka\" Old Man Making a Jar is a 1969 South Korean film directed by Choi Ha-won.

After getting over his initial shock, the boy starts to take care of him.  The story follows their relationship over the next few days between John and 'Man', with the Man showing himself to be demanding, bossy and messy, but nevertheless a bond forms between the pair.  Their time together involves many funny and peculiar moments, such as an odd obsession with Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade, using socks for jumpers, and a near-death collision with a marmalade jar.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:What type of vegetation does Tabernaemontana and Crinum have in common?\nDocs:Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii:Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii is an evergreen tree from the Apocynaceae family.  In Spanish, it is huevos de caballo, cojones de burro, cojón de mico, or cojotón.  The name, \"huevos de caballo\", comes from the oval shape of the tree's hanging fruit.  It is native to Mexico and Central America.  The type locality is San Felipe, Retalhuleu in Guatemala.  \"Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii\" is similar to \"Tabernaemontana glabra\", except that its leaves and flowers are smaller and its fruit is larger.\nCrinum americanum:Crinum americanum is an aquatic angiosperm native to North America from Texas to South Carolina, as well as Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.  Common names for this species include Florida swamp-lily, string lily, and southern swamp crinum.  The species grows in small groups in still water habitats.\nLourensford Alluvium Fynbos:Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos is a critically endangered vegetation type that is endemic to Cape Town.  Though closest to Fynbos, it has characteristics of both Fynbos and Renosterveld vegetation and is thus actually a unique hybrid vegetation type.\nDesert riparian:Desert riparian: Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\").  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.\nCaatinga:Caatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).  It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.  The name \"Caatinga\" is a Tupi word meaning \"white forest\" or \"white vegetation\" (\"caa\" = forest, vegetation, \"tinga\" = white).\nDinaric calcareous block fir forest:The Dinaric calcareous silver fir forests are an endemic vegetation type of the littoral Dinaric Alps, located in southeastern Europe.  Pure stands of Dinaric calcareous Silver fir —\"Abies alba\" forests appear on limestone escarpments in the montane zones of Orjen, Velebit, Biokovo and Prenj.  They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty.  As a highly endemic and rare vegetation type of the Dinarids it needs protection.\nVegetation and slope stability:Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.\nDesert dry wash:Desert dry wash is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events.  Desert dry wash is contrasted with desert riparian vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface.  Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event.  Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event.  They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding.  Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (\"Psorothamnus spinosus\"), desert willow (\"Chilopsis linearis\"), catclaw (\"Senegalia greggii\"), cheesebush (\"Ambrosia salsola\"), and waterweed (\"Baccharis sergiloides\").\nVegetation classification:Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.\nWildfire:A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.  Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.\n\nAnswer:"

Hagemeister Park was a park owned by the Hagemeister brewery; during games ropes were set-up around the field and attendees either walked up or parked their cars nearby and used them for seats.  After the first season, a small grandstand was built and the field was fenced off.  Green Bay East High School was built at the location of Hagemeister Park in 1922, which forced the Packers to move to Bellevue Park, a small minor league baseball stadium that seated 5,000.  They only played for two seasons at Bellevue Park before moving to City Stadium in 1925.  Although City Stadium was the Packers' official home field, in 1933 they began to play part of their home schedule in Milwaukee to attract more fans and revenue.  After hosting one game at Borchert Field in 1933, the Packers played two or three home games each year in Milwaukee, at Wisconsin State Fair Park from 1934 to 1951 and at Marquette Stadium in 1952.  The games were moved to Milwaukee County Stadium after it opened in 1953 and continued through 1994, after which the Packers moved back to Green Bay permanently.\n1963–64 Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team:The 1963–64 Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team represented Creighton University during the 1963–64 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Hess was denounced by Hitler, his former office was dissolved, and the new Party Chancellery was formed in its place under Martin Bormann.\nKarl Haushofer:Karl Ernst Haushofer (27 August 1869 – 10 March 1946) was a German general, geographer and politician.  Through his student Rudolf Hess, Haushofer's ideas influenced the development of Adolf Hitler's expansionist strategies, although Haushofer denied direct influence on the Nazi regime.  Under the Nuremberg Laws, Haushofer's wife and children were categorized as \"Mischlinge\".  His son, Albrecht, was issued a German Blood Certificate through the help of Hess.\nWolf Rüdiger Hess:Wolf Rüdiger Hess (\"Heß\" in German; 18 November 1937 – 24 October 2001) was the son of Rudolf Hess and Ilse Pröhl Hess.  He was also an outspoken critic of the investigation into his father's death, which he believed was a cover-up.  He maintained that the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had murdered his father in order to prevent his parole—which he believed to be imminent—because the British government were afraid that his father, if allowed to speak freely, would reveal embarrassing information about British actions during World War II.  In 2007, however, documents demonstrating British support for Hess' release on humanitarian grounds and their campaign against steadfast Soviet opposition to his release were published.\nWarsaw (song):\"Warsaw\" is the opening song by Joy Division on their \"An Ideal for Living\" EP.

Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles.  The film's overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the leader who will bring glory to the nation.  Because the film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives (on 30 June) many prominent Sturmabteilung (SA) members are absent—they were murdered in that Party purge, organised and orchestrated by Hitler to replace the SA with the Schutzstaffel (SS) as his main paramilitary force.\nThule Society:The Thule Society ( ; German: \"Thule-Gesellschaft\" ), originally the \"Studiengruppe für germanisches Altertum\" (\"Study Group for Germanic Antiquity\"), was a German occultist and \"völkisch\" group founded in Munich right after World War I, named after a mythical northern country in Greek legend.  The Society is notable chiefly as the organization that sponsored the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP; German Workers' Party), which was later reorganized by Adolf Hitler into the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party).

Because of this change, the Third has been called the \"anti-kuchkist\" symphony in Glazunov's output (\"kuchkist\" from \"kuchka\", the shortened Russian name for the nationalist music group The Five).  He would tone down these new influences in his subsequent symphonies as he strove for an eclectic mature style.  The Third also shows a greater depth of expression, most evident in the chromatic turns of its third movement, reminiscent of Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\".\nSymphony No. 2 (Glazunov):The Symphony No. 2 in F-sharp minor, Op.  16, was composed by Alexander Glazunov in 1884–1886, and was published in 1889.  It is dedicated to the memory of Franz Liszt.\nPiano Concerto No. 1 (Glazunov):Alexander Glazunov composed his Piano Concerto No. 1 in F minor, Opus, 92, in 1911, during his tenure as director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory.  The concerto is dedicated to Leopold Godowsky, whom Glazunov had heard on tour in St. Petersburg in 1905.\nSymphony No. 3 (Glière):The Symphony No. 3 in B minor \"\"Ilya Muromets\"\", Op.  42, is a large symphonic work by Russian composer Reinhold Glière.  A program symphony, it depicts the life of Kievan Rus' folk hero Ilya Muromets.  It was written from 1908 to 1911 and dedicated to Alexander Glazunov.  The premier took place in Moscow on 23 March 1912 under Emil Cooper, and in 1914 the piece earned Glière his third Glinka Award (having already received it in 1905 and 1912).\nSymphony No. 4 (Glazunov):The Symphony No. 4 in E flat major, Op.  48, was written by Alexander Glazunov in 1893.  The symphony was a departure from Glazunov's three earlier symphonies, which were based on nationalistic Russian tunes and, according to the composer, allowed him to give \"personal, free, and subjective impressions of myself.\"\nSymphony No. 5 (Glazunov):The Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 55 (also known as The Heroic ), was written by Alexander Glazunov from April to October 1895.  Although in this symphony Glazunov returned to his conventional four-movement layout (his Fourth Symphony had only three) he frequently utilizes thematic transformation.  Glazunov described it as \"silenced sounds\" and \"an architectural poem\".\nRussian Symphony Concerts:The idea for the Russian Symphony Concerts was Rimsky-Korsakov's.  He had become acquainted with Belyayev at the weekly \"quartet Fridays\" (\"Les Vendredis\") held at Belayev's home.  Belayev had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov, who had been one of Rimsky-Korsakov's composition students.  In 1884, Belayev rented out a hall and hired an orchestra to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed.  Glazunov was to conduct part of this concert.  Seeing he was not ready to do this, Rimsky-Korsakov volunteered to take his place.  This \"rehearsal,\" as Rimsky-Korsakov called it, went well and pleased both Belayev and the invited audience.  Buoyed by the success of the rehearsal, Belayev decided the following season to give a public concert of works by Glazunov and other composers.  Rimsky-Korsakov's piano concerto was played, along with Glazunov's symphonic poem \"Stenka Razin\".\nBelyayev circle:Belyayev circle: The Belyayev circle (Russian: Беляевский кружок ) was a society of Russian musicians who met in Saint Petersburg, Russia between 1885 and 1908, and whose members included Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Alexander Glazunov, Vladimir Stasov, Anatoly Lyadov, Alexander Ossovsky, Witold Maliszewski, Nikolai Tcherepnin, Nikolay Sokolov, Alexander Winkler among others.  The circle was named after Mitrofan Belyayev, a timber merchant and amateur musician who became a music philanthropist and publisher after hearing the music of the teenage Glazunov.\nWilson Sawyer:Wilson Sawyer (1917–1979) was an American composer, arranger and musician.  Born in Traverse City, Michigan, he showed musical talent at an early age and studied music at the University of Michigan.  Sawyer conducted the University's Women's Glee Club and led the Bill Sawyer Orchestra, a big band that was featured on WMAQ's \"Fitch Summer Bandwagon\" on July 7, 1940.  He composed several arrangements of choral works; popular songs for Perry Como, Fred Waring and Ray Eberle; music for the \"Alaskan Stampede,\" a Leo Seltzer produced \"musical extravaganza on ice\" c. 1944, and an opera based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.  He is best known for composing Symphony No. 1, known as the Alaskan Symphony, at Gypsy Trail, Carmel, New York in 1945.  The work includes text from the \"Spell of the Yukon\" by Robert W. Service sung by a baritone soloist in the third movement, as well as other thematic inspirations drawn from his study of the climate, topography and history of the then-territory.  The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time.  Wilson Sawyer conducted the piece and Gov. Ernest Gruening of Alaska was guest speaker on the program.  At Gruening's request, the original score was placed in the Alaskan Museum of Natural History [Alaska Historical Library and Museum] in Juneau, Alaska.  In 1960, Sawyer's wife Maxine was diagnosed with spinal cancer and they moved to Pawling, New York where he operated a chicken farm and laundromat.  He continued to compose.  The Alaskan Symphony was performed by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in 1975 with Sawyer again conducting even though he had recently suffered a stroke.  Sawyer revised the Symphony in 1977, making substantial cuts to the fourth movement among other edits.  The revised Alaskan Symphony was premiered by the Juneau Symphony on June 14, 2008, conducted by music director Kyle Wiley Pickett.\n\nAnswer:"

Six months earlier, while staying in Aleppo, Wilfrid and Lady Anne had made a plan to import some of the best Arabian horses to England and breed them there.  In Lady Anne's words, \"it would be an interesting and useful thing to do and I should like much to try it.\"\nRotrou III, Count of Perche:Rotrou III, Count of Perche: Rotrou III (bef.  1080 – [20 January/6 May] 1144), called the Great (\"le Grand\"), was the Count of Perche and Mortagne from 1099.  He was the son of Geoffrey II, Count of Perch, and Beatrix de Ramerupt, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier.  He was a notable Crusader and a participant in the \"Reconquista\" in eastern Spain, even ruling the city of Tudela in Navarre from 1123 to 1131.  He is commonly credited with introducing Arabian horses to the Perche, giving rise to the Percheron breed.  By his creation of a monastery at La Trappe in memory of his wife, Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, in 1122 he also laid the foundations of the later Trappists.\nPercheron:The Percheron is a breed of draft horse that originated in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name.  Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work.  Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century.  They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods.  In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed.  Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.\nSella Italiano:Sella Italiano is an equine breed created in Italy.  The Italian Government has passed a law that created a stud book for the new breed.  The breed is blending the remnant indigenous Italian breeds of Maremmano, Salernitano and Persano horse with Anglo Arabo Sardo, Purosangue Orientale, Arabian and Thoroughbred.  The progeny of said horses can be registered as Sella Italiano if they can pass a “performance test”.  Furthermore, the stud book is open to other European warmbloods if they can pass the performance test and be approved by the breed registry.  The breed is intended to produce a sport horse which can compete successfully at the international level.\nPurosangue Orientale:The Purosangue Orientale or Puro Sangue Orientale (PSO) (en: “Oriental Purebred”), is a horse breed developed in the Kingdom of Italy by Royal Decree n° 2690 of 19 September 1875, which created a stud book dedicated to the breed.  Beginning in 1864, the Italian Government had sent emissaries into Syria and Mesopotamia to purchase desert bred Arabian horses directly from Bedouin tribes.  Numerous stallions and mares were purchased and brought back to Sicily, many being destined for the Royal Remount Station in Catania.\nFrench Saddle Pony:The French Saddle Pony, also called the Poney Français de Selle, is pony breed developed as a sport pony for children and smaller adult riders.  It was initially developed in 1969 as the Poney de Croisement (Cross-bred Pony), and in 1972 a stud book was created.  In 1991 the stud book was closed and the breed renamed to Poney Français de Selle.  The breed combines a mix of French and British pony breeds, as well as Thoroughbred and Arabian blood, to create the horse seen today.  Due to the large number of breeds used to create the French Saddle Pony, there is not yet a defined set of physical characteristics for the breed, although all tend to be suited for competition in English riding disciplines, including dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing.  They fill a similar role as the British Riding Pony and the German riding pony.\nRotrou IV, Count of Perche:Rotrou IV (1135-1191), Count of Perche, son of Rotrou III, Count of Perche, and Hawise, daughter of Walter of Salisbury, and Sibilla de Chaworth.  Rotrou was from the House of Châteaudun and descended from the Viscounts of Châteaudun.  His mother was a sister of Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury.  Patrick’s sister Sibyll married John FitzGilbert, the Marshal of the Horses, whose son Henry was Bishop of Exeter and a knight in the service of Rotrou.\nYeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera:Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera, (en: \"Military Stud of de Jerez de la Frontera\") known outside Spain as the Yeguada Militar is the military Spanish stud farm headquartered in Andalusia, Spain, dedicated to horse breeding of purebred Andalusian horses and Arabian horses. Founded in 1847, it became the state military stud farm in 1893.  In the 20th century, as need for cavalry horses declined, the stud's emphasis shifted to become a genetic reservoir to preserve the bloodlines of the Pure Spanish Horse and to continue to breed high quality Arabian horses, with stallions of both breeds being made available to private horse breeders to improve the horses of Spain.  Today, there are two facilities located in the Jerez de la Frontera area, one primarily for stallions, the other for mares and foals, as well as multiple stallion depots across the country.\nBardigiano:The Bardigiano is a breed of small horse from the Emilia Romagna region of Italy.  It takes its name from the town of Bardi, in the Apennines of Parma, and is principally associated with the surrounding area and the Valle del Ceno.  The mountain environment and steep, rough terrain of the area have contributed to produce a robust, hardy breed, agile and sure-footed over difficult ground.  Although some males and all females are under  hands , the Bardigiano is always considered a horse in its home country.  The stud book was established in 1977, and is held by the Associazione Provinciale Allevatori, the regional animal breeders' association, of Parma.  The breed is widely distributed in Italy, with breeders in 26 Italian provinces; a recent study examined 3556 stud book entries for living horses.  Due to these relatively large numbers, the breed is not considered to be at risk of extinction, but is classed as \"vulnerable\".\nGerman Warmblood:German Warmblood may refer generally to any of the various warmblood horses of Germany, or more specifically to a warmblood registered with the nationwide German Horse Breeding Society (ZfDP).  Beneath the umbrella term \"German warmblood\" are several regional variations on a singular standard; individual German warmblood types are not necessarily considered \"breeds\", because they have an open stud book and freely exchange genetic material between each other, with other warmblood types, with Anglo-Arabians, and with breeds like the Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Trakehner.  (The Trakehner, while a warmblood horse from Germany, has a closed stud book and thus, like the Thoroughbred and Arabian, is considered a \"true\" breed.)\n\nAnswer:"

Although emerging at the same time as other bands in the punk rock movement, the Rezillos did not share the nihilism or social commentary of their contemporaries, but instead took a more light-hearted approach to their songs, preferring to describe themselves at the time as \"a New Wave beat group\".  Their songs are heavily influenced by 1950s rock and roll, 1960s English beat music and garage rock, early 1970s glam rock, and recurring lyrical themes of science fiction and B movies, influences that mirrored those of US bands the Cramps, the B-52s, and X who were starting out at the same time.  The Rezillos' biggest hit in their home country was the UK Top 20 single \"Top of the Pops\" in 1978, but they are best known outside the UK for their cover version of \"Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight\", which featured on the soundtrack to \"\" in 2002.  Since the Rezillos recorded it, the song has been covered by other punk bands, including Youth Brigade and Murphy's Law.\nHollowick:Hollowick is a Canadian rock band from Oshawa, formerly called Rides Again.

The first single, \"Wonder Why\", was produced by Gavin Brown (known for producing other Canadian bands including Billy Talent and Three Days Grace).  Videos and singles followed for Infected and It's Too Late, which received play on MuchMoreMusic.  \"Infected\" became a top 10 modern rock hit in Canada.  The band has toured with Theory of a Deadman, Social Code, The Trews and Hedley, Yellowcard among others.  A few years before \"Into the Existence\", Rides Again was known for their hit song \"Geeze Louise\", a pop rock song popular among young teens.  The band was incorporated with Vodoo Records at this time, playing across southern Ontario.  At this time the original drummer and cousin of Nathan and Chad, Bradley Christiansen, was in the band, but had left later on to pursue other career options.  2007 seemed to be the year for the striving Canadian band having their music videos published on Much Music, and Much More Music as well as radio stations across Canada.  In mid-2009, Mike McElroy resigned as Rides Again drummer to pursue other importances.  After Mike left they asked drummer and musician Kelly Voelkel to join the band, Kelly performed all of the drums and percussion on Hollowick's upcoming album.  In July 2009 Kelly left to pursue more professional endeavours.  Friend Anthony Moreino and former Rides Again merchandise guy filled in on drums for a short time for Hollowick, until new drummer Frank Goerz was found.  With Goerz now behind the drum kit, there's a new level of explosive energy never felt before for Hollowick.\n\nAnswer:"

The process has created the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention.  It is named after the University of Bologna, where the Bologna declaration was signed by education ministers from 29 European countries in 1999.  The process was opened to other countries in the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, and governmental meetings have been held in Prague (2001), Berlin (2003), Bergen (2005), London (2007) and Leuven (2009).\nSwedish Higher Education Act:The Swedish Higher Education Act is the Swedish law governing higher education in Sweden.

Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.  The modern Japanese higher education system has undergone numerous changes since the Meiji period and was largely modeled after Western countries such as Germany, France, Britain, and the United States to create a unique Japanese model to serve its national needs.  The Japanese higher education system differs from higher education in most other countries in many significant ways.  Key differences include the method of acceptance, which relies almost entirely on one or two tests, as opposed to GPAs (Grade Point Average) or other methods of assessment used in Western countries.

As soon as she was eighteen, Maude signed herself up for an American missionary training school, Avant Ministries (GMU).  After completing this schooling and doing some missions work within American inner cities, Maude was accepted to travel with the GMU to serve alongside a few struggling Christian missionaries in Morocco.  For the next fifty years of her life Maude Cary would minister to the rich and poor Muslims within Morocco attempting to bring them the Gospel message her school and parents had taught her.  A difficult start made Maude question her efffectivness in Morocco but she trusted that there would eventually be conversions from Islam to Christianity and stayed until she was too ill to serve.  Becoming very ill she flew back to America for treatment and as soon as possible returned to continue her life living among the Muslims.  Through the difficult start and her illness, Maude Cary became a Christian leader within Morocco for the Gospel Mission Union in charge of translation and Bible schools.  She eventually became too sick to continue and returned to the United States.  Her hard work in Morocco may not have produced many conversions during her stay there, but there were a few conversions which were seen as a success, and continued the Christian influence within the country long after her life.  After fifty years of service Maude returned to the United States because of her illness, and died in 1967.\nGo proverb:Go proverb: Go proverbs are traditional proverbs relating to the game of Go, generally used to help one find good moves in various situations during a game.

He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake).\nShakespearean tragedy:Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare.  Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio.  The Roman tragedies—\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories.  Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy.  They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.  Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending.  The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars.\nRory Williams:Rory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\".

Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \"Macbeth\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.  It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.\nRevenge tragedy:Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England.  Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\"  Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).\nAnna Devane:Anna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, \"General Hospital\", played by Finola Hughes.

The storyline in which Duke tries to evade his criminal past with the Jerome family, allows for Duke and Anna to become one of the show's supercouples, along with Robert and Anna.  However, the storyline ends in tragedy when Duke dies in Anna's arms.  Robert and Anna eventually reunite to raise their daughter, Robin, and eventually remarry; the happiness is short lived and the duo are killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:what species of plants are Chamelaucium and Vanilla derived from?\nDocs:Vanilla (genus):Vanilla (genus): Vanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae).  The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived.  It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.  The key constituent imparting its popular characteristics is the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin.\nArthropodium milleflorum:Arthropodium milleflorum (pale vanilla lily) is a species of herbaceous perennial plants native to Australia.  It occurs in various habitats including alpine areas and grows to between 0.3 and 1.3 metres high and 0.3 metres wide.  The fleshy tubers were eaten by Aborigines.  The plant has a strong vanilla fragrance, especially noticeable on warm days.\nVanilla:Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \"Vanilla\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\").  The word \"vanilla\", derived from \"vainilla\" , the diminutive of the Spanish word \"vaina\" (\"vaina\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\".  Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \"tlilxochitl\" by the Aztecs.  Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\nSelenicereus grandiflorus:Selenicereus grandiflorus is a cactus species originating from the Antilles, Mexico and Central America.  The species is commonly referred to as queen of the night, night-blooming cereus (though these two terms are also used for other species), large-flowered cactus, sweet-scented cactus or vanilla cactus.  The true species is extremely rare in cultivation.  Most of the plants under this name belong to other species or hybrids.  It is often confused with the species of \"Epiphyllum\".\nArthropodium minus:Arthropodium minus, the small vanilla lily, is a species of herbaceous perennial plants native to the Southern Hemisphere.  Valued as bush tucker as the roots are edible raw.\nJatropha:Jatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.  The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (\"iatros\"), meaning \"physician\", and τροφή (\"trophe\"), meaning \"nutrition\", hence the common name physic nut.  Another common name is nettlespurge.  It contains approximately 170 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like \"Jatropha curcas\").  Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World.  Plants produce separate male and female flowers.  As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, \"Jatropha\" contains compounds that are highly toxic.  Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production.  In the 2000s, one species, \"Jatropha curcas\", generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production.\nAnna Maria Walker:Anna Maria Walker (née Patton) (c. 1778–1852) and her husband Colonel George Warren Walker (1778–1843) were Scottish botanists in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) who made extensive collections of plants between 1830 and 1838.  Several species of ferns and orchids were named after them by Sir William Jackson Hooker with whom they corresponded.  They also corresponded with and collaborated with other botanists in the region such as Robert Wight.  Anna Maria was also an excellent botanical artist who illustrated many species of orchids. Plant species named after them include \"Vanilla walkeriae\", \"Liparis walkeriae\" and \"Thrixspermum walkeri\".\nEriocaulon:Eriocaulon is a genus of about 400 species commonly known as pipeworts, of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Eriocaulaceae.  The genus is widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical regions, particularly southern Asia and the Americas.  A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern.  Only one species (\"E. aquaticum\") occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland; this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe.  In the Americas, \"Eriocaulon\" is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida.  They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.  The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek εριον, \"erion\", meaning 'wool', and καυλός, \"caulos\", meaning 'stalk'.\nCuphea:Cuphea is a genus containing about 260 species of annual and perennial flowering plants native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas.  The species range from low-growing herbaceous plants to semi-woody shrubs up to 2 m tall.  Commonly they are known as cupheas, or, in the case of some species, as cigar plants.  The generic name is derived from the Greek word κυφος (\"kyphos\"), meaning \"bent,\" \"curved,\" or \"humped.\"\nBotany:Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology.  A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field.  The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word βοτάνη (\"botanē\") meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; βοτάνη is in turn derived from βόσκειν (\"boskein\"), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\".  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress.  Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 species of land plants of which some 391,000 species are vascular plants (including ca 369,000 species of flowering plants), and ca 20,000 are bryophytes.\n\nAnswer:"

The movement, whose original devotees were mostly associated with the University of Oxford, argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology.  They thought of Anglicanism as one of three branches of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.\nThomas Mozley:Thomas Mozley (1806 – June 17, 1893), was an English clergyman and writer associated with the Oxford Movement.\nTracts for the Times:The Tracts for the Times were a series of 90 theological publications, varying in length from a few pages to book-length, produced by members of the English Oxford Movement, an Anglo-Catholic revival group, from 1833 to 1841.  There were about a dozen authors, including Oxford Movement leaders John Keble, John Henry Newman and Edward Bouverie Pusey, with Newman taking the initiative in the series, and making the largest contribution.  With the wide distribution associated with the tract form, and a price in pennies, the \"Tracts\" succeeded in drawing attention to the views of the Oxford Movement on points of doctrine, but also to its overall approach, to the extent that \"Tractarian\" became a synonym for supporter of the movement.\nLiturgical Movement:The Liturgical Movement began as a 19th-century movement of scholarship for the reform of worship within the Roman Catholic Church.  It has developed over the last century and a half and has affected many other Christian Churches, including the Church of England and other churches of the Anglican Communion, and some Protestant churches.  A similar reform in the Church of England and Anglican Communion, known as the Oxford Movement, began to change theology and liturgy in the United Kingdom and United States in the mid-nineteenth century.  The Liturgical Movement has been one of the major influences on the process of the Ecumenical Movement, in favor of reversing the divisions which began at the Reformation.\nList of Anglican devotional societies:Since the time of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England, there have been organizations whose purpose is the propagation of the Catholic Faith within the Anglican Communion.  Each of these societies champions one aspect of Ritualism and Anglican doctrine which otherwise is not emphasized by the Anglican Churches as a whole.  Mostly, these are groups or organisations that are part of the High Church or Anglo-Catholic movement, and are considered conservative or orthodox.  Many of them are members or associates of the Catholic societies of the Church of England.\nHenry Bedford (educator):Henry Bedford MA(Cantab) (1816-1903) was an English Catholic convert formerly attached to the Oxford Movement, was an educator and writer of many Catholic leaflets.  He was born in London on October 1, 1816.  In 1835 he went to St. Peter's College, Cambridge where he obtained an MA in Arts and Science.  He went to train as a priest in the Church of England serving as assistant curate in Christ Church, Hoxton, and was noted as a preacher.  In 1851 converted to Catholicism and in 1852 he moved to Ireland after an offer to join to staff of All Hallows College in Dublin where he lectured as Professor of Natural Science, he also served as treasurer and joined the board of directors.  A natural defect in his right hand was a canonical obstacle to his ordination into the church.  He continued to teach, and write and be published on a variety of subjects, and also lecture publicly.\nJohn Keble Church, Mill Hill:The John Keble Church is a Church of England parish church in Mill Hill, London Borough of Barnet.

From his upbringing amidst the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement, Froude intended to become a clergyman, but doubts about the doctrines of the Anglican church, published in his scandalous 1849 novel \"The Nemesis of Faith\", drove him to abandon his religious career.  Froude turned to writing history, becoming one of the best known historians of his time for his \"History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada\".  Inspired by Thomas Carlyle, Froude's historical writings were often fiercely polemical, earning him a number of outspoken opponents.  Froude continued to be controversial up until his death for his \"Life of Carlyle\", which he published along with personal writings of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle.  These publications illuminated Carlyle's often selfish personality, and led to persistent gossip and discussion of the couple's marital problems.\n\nAnswer:"

The film was directed by Bill Paxton, and was his last film as a director.  Shia LaBeouf plays the role of Ouimet.  The film's screenplay was adapted by Mark Frost from his book, \"The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf\".

The Nashville Vols won the game and thus the pennant by .002 percentage points, after finishing the prior season in last place.  Both teams had the same number of losses (56), but the New Orleans Pelicans were in first place with 76 wins to the Vols' second-place 74.  Carl Sitton used his spitball to out-pitch Ted Breitenstein for a complete-game, nine-strikeout, four-hit, shutout.  According to one account, \"By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an eyelash.  Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history\".\nModern history of American football:The modern history of American football can be considered to have begun after the 1932 NFL Playoff game, which was the first American football game to feature hash marks, the legalization of the forward pass anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line; it was also the first indoor game since 1902.  Other innovations to occur in the years after 1932 were the introduction of the AP Poll in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first Heisman Trophy in 1935, the first NFL draft in 1936 and the first televised game in 1939.  Another important event was the American football game at the 1932 Summer Olympics, which combined with a similar demonstration game at the 1933 World's Fair, led to the first College All-Star Game in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States.  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\".  A rival league to the NFL, the American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960.  In 1966, the NFL initiated the AFL–NFL merger between the two leagues.

He was the son of Luis Antonio and Balbina Acosta and lived most of his life in his native province far from the limelights of Buenos Aires and the academic world which he sincerely despised in favor of a bucolic and rural setting of his father's cattle farm in Belén.  At age seventeen Franco was awarded a literary prize for his \"Oda primaveral\".  Franco traveled a considerable distance to receive the award riding on a mule's back from Catamarca Province to Tucuman.  The attitude raised a few eyebrows in Buenos Aires and a relevant article was publish in the prestigious magazine \"Caras y caretas\" relating the story of this promising young author.  The first literary personality to open the doors to Franco was Horacio Quiroga.  Quiroga would eventually introduced Franco to Leopoldo Lugones who recognized his talent and potential.  Soon Franco became a recognizable name in the literary world of his time making the acquaintance of Roberto Arlt, Gabriela Mistral and Juana de Ibarbourou amongst others.  However, Luis Franco found it difficult to coexist with the cultural apparatus and the bourgeois-style of other intellectuals in Buenos Aires, and soon -after completing his High School degree- returned to his hometown of Belén.  In Belén, Franco resided most of his adult life doing what he loved most: working the land, reading and writing.  As a result of a personal crisis –coincidental with the military coup of general José Evaristo Uriburu in 1930- Franco dissociates himself from right wing revisionists such as Lugones and begins an audacious journey of introspection in the nature of Argentina’s political past.  The result is a copious bibliography of essays where the ghost of saints and devils of Argentina’s turbulent 1800’s comes to life in a unique fashion, one that perhaps Franco only shares with Ezequiel Martínez Estrada.\n\nAnswer:"

They came close to completing the \"league and cup double\" in the 1912–13 season, winning the league but losing to Aston Villa in the 1913 FA Cup Final.

They had not won the FA Cup until the 1936–37 season when they defeated Preston North End in the 1937 FA Cup Final.  Sunderland entered The Football League in 1890 and were not relegated from the top division until the 1957–58 season; a total of 58 seasons in the highest division of England.  Their next trophy came in the 1973 FA Cup Final as they beat Leeds United 1–0.  They reached the 1985 Football League Cup Final but finished as runners-up to Norwich City after being beaten 1–0.  In the 1986–87 season Sunderland were relegated to the Football League Third Division for the first time in their history under the management of Lawrie McMenemy, they however, returned to the second division the following season as champions–their lowest position in the English football league system.  Their first appearance in the Premier League came in the 1999–2000 season after being promoted as champions from Division One.  In winning promotion the club gained 105 points, which was a record at the time.  Sunderland gained just 15 points in the 2005-06 season, which set the record for the lowest number of points in a Premier League season, which has since been eclipsed by Derby County.\n\nAnswer:"

He was most famous for his ellipsoid algorithm (1979) for linear programming, which was the first such algorithm known to have a polynomial running time.

A mursmäcka was a female construction worker with the task to hand mortar during construction work.  The profession is recorded from at least 1691 (though it is not confirmed by name until the 1830s) and discontinued in 1922.  This was a very hard but common work for a poor uneducated women during the 19th century, particularly in Stockholm.  In July 1888, the Mursmäcka of Stockholm performed a great strike action which attracted considerable attention in contemporary Sweden.\nBullying in medicine:Bullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee physicians.  It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.\nReading law:Reading law is the method by which persons in common law countries, particularly the United States, entered the legal profession before the advent of law schools.

Professional conventions focus on issues of concern to the profession and advancements in the profession.  Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest.  Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities.  Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying from one to another.  Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as gaming or model railroads.\nNurse stereotypes:A stereotype is a generalized idea or image about a particular person or thing that is often oversimplified and offensive.  Stereotypes are victim of prejudice when negative portrayals of a group are untrue of individual members.  Nursing has been stereotyped throughout the history of the profession.  A common misconception is that all nurses are female; this has led to the stereotype of male nurses as effeminate.  These generalized ideas of the nursing profession have formed a skewed image of nurses in the media.  The image of a nurse projected by the media is typically of a young white single female being over-sexualized as well as diminished intellectually; this idea is then portrayed in get-well cards, television shows and novels.  The over-sexualized nurse is commonly referred to as a naughty nurse and is shown as a sex symbol or nymphomaniac. Along with these common stereotypes, studies have identified several other popular images used in media such as handmaiden, angel, torturer, homosexual male, alcoholic, buffoon and woman in white.  Common stereotypes of nursing and portrayal of these misconceptions have fueled a discussion on the effects they have on the profession, harmful or good.\n\nAnswer:"

It was proclaimed as the Caprivi Game Reserve in 1966 and upgraded to the Caprivi Game Park in 1968.  It was never managed as a game park as the area was a restricted security zone during Namibia’s liberation struggle.  The South African Police and later the South African Defence Force occupied the area until the implementation of U.N. Resolution 435 in April 1989.  The then Department of Nature Conservation appointed the first nature conservation officer and other staff and started work in the area.  Many of the area's original Khwe San inhabitants, were conscripted into the army and lived in military bases such as Omega.

Art games are \"interactive\" (usually \"competitive\" against the computer, self, or other players) and the result of \"artistic intent\" by the party offering the piece for consideration.  They also typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design.  The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling.  Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"video game art\".\nVGA Planets:VGA Planets is a graphical, multi-player, space strategy war game.

According to the developer, the 358 ha park with a 1.8 km chairlift and initially 50 km of downhill tracks is the largest facility of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.  The park closed on 13 February as a precaution due to a nearby fire and two days later, most of the park's tree cover had been destroyed in a large wildfire.  The lift and ziplines have suffered significant damage, and the park's condition is much worse than the operator initially thought.

No spoon may be grabbed until one player has collected a four of a kind, but once the first player to get a four of a kind has grabbed a spoon, all players may immediately reach out to attempt to grab a spoon.  No player may grab more than one spoon at a time.  As in the game musical chairs, there is always one \"fewer\" spoon than there are players, so one player will always be left without a spoon.  Depending on the variety of game being played, that player either loses the game and is eliminated, or continues playing but loses a point.  When two players are left and one person gets four of a kind, it doesn't matter who gets the spoon.  At that point, whoever gets it the fastest wins.\nJackson Lake Ranger Station:The Jackson Lake Ranger Station is the last Depression-era U.S. Forest Service ranger station in its original location in Grand Teton National Park.  When first established, the park comprised only the mountainous terrain above Jackson Hole, while the remainder of what would eventually become the park was administered by the Forest Service as part of Teton National Forest.  The Jackson Lake Station was built in 1933 as close as possible to Park Service property as possible as a kind of resistance to the park's expansion.  The station was one of five Forest Service stations in the area, and was taken over by the National Park Service when Jackson Hole National Monument was established in 1943, later becoming an enlarged Grand Teton National Park.  It is the only such station not to have been moved or altered by the Park Service.\n\nAnswer:"

He ruled Kaganoi Castle.  During the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Shigemochi fought under his father Shigemune, who was attached to the forces of Oda Nobukatsu.  Soon after, Kaganoi Castle was surrounded by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi; Shigemune surrendered, and Shigemochi was employed by Hideyoshi as a messenger, receiving a stipend of 10,000 \"koku\".

Levinson had been repairing guitars since 1964 and, in 1977, during his graduate studies at the University of Basel, Switzerland, he founded Guitars by Levinson.  Using the experience he gathered from his work, he decided to start Blade Guitars in 1985.  By 1986, he was refining the idea of a line of guitars based on the concept he defines as \"Classic Design, Creative Technology\"; at this time, he was also determining the features that would characterize his range of guitars.  In January 1987, a manufacturing deal was reached for the production of the guitars.  Blade Guitars made their debut in October 1987, at the music show of Tokyo.  Their presentation at the Frankfurt Musikmesse in 1988 signalled their European launch.\nCanaanean blade:Canaanean blade: A Canaanean blade is an archaeological term for a long, wide blade made out of stone or flint, predominantly found at sites in Israel and Lebanon (ancient Canaan).  They were first manufactured and used in the Neolithic Stone Age to be used as weapons such as javelins or arrowheads.  The same technology was used during the later Chalcolithic period in the production of broad sickle blade elements for harvesting of crops.  Canaanean blades were also used in the threshing of cereal grains.  This indicates the presence of early agricultural technologies.  The blades would be attached to a small wooden platform with bitumen.  The platform, with a human or other weight standing on it, was then pulled behind an animal across a threshing floor.  The forward motion of the animal paired with the downward force of weight exerted through the blades served to cut grain into small pieces.\nKujang (weapon):The kujang is a blade weapon native to the Sundanese people of western Java, Indonesia.

The earliest steel blades were laminated out of necessity, due to the early bloomery method of smelting iron, which made production of steel expensive and inconsistent.  Laminated steel offered both a way to average out the properties of the steel, as well as a way to restrict high carbon steel to the areas that needed it most.  Laminated steel blades are still produced today for specialized applications, where different requirements at different points in the blade are met by use of different alloys, forged together into a single blade.\nOrder of Saint Anthony (Ethiopia):The Order of Saint Anthony was a possibly apocryphal chivalric order of Ethiopia, which according to legend founded around 370 by the Emperor of Ethiopia.

                "value": "Question:Which dog breed has more derivative breeds from the original, German Spitz or Norfolk Spaniel?\nDocs:German Spitz:German Spitz: German Spitz is used to refer to both a breed of dog and category or type of dog.  Several modern breeds have been developed from the German Spitz, and are either registered as separate breeds or as varieties of German Spitz.  All the \"German Spitz type\" dogs are dogs of the Spitz type of German origin.  The Großspitz, Mittelspitz, and Kleinspitz breeds of \"German Spitz type\" are also called the German Spitz in English.\nNorfolk Spaniel:The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog since the early 20th century.  It was originally thought to have originated from the work of one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century.  The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.\nGerman Spitz (Klein):The German Spitz Klein is a breed of dog of the German Spitz type.  They are usually classed as a toy or utility breed.\nAmerican Eskimo Dog:The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog originating in Germany.  The American Eskimo is a member of the Spitz family.  The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German prejudice during the First World War, it was renamed \"American Eskimo Dog\".  Although modern American Eskimos have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different.  In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.\nPomeranian (dog):The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in Germany and Poland in Central Europe.  Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, specifically the German Spitz.  It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (\"Dwarf-Spitz\").\nEnglish Springer Spaniel:The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game.  It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years.  They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines.  The breed suffers from average health complaints.  The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare.  It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter.  The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring,\" game.  In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed.  They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis.  The term \"Springer\" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.\nAmerican Cocker Spaniel:The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog.  It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK.  In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \"Cocker Spaniel\" before the American variety was created.  The word \"cocker\" is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while \"spaniel\" is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.\nKing Charles Spaniel:The King Charles Spaniel (also known as the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type.  In 1903, the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title.  The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed.\nPicardy Spaniel:The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog.  It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds.  It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain.  However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century.  Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.\nWelsh Springer Spaniel:The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family.  Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel.  They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity.  Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel.  The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern.  Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers.  Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions.  They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:Which species is the most numerous, Podocarpus or Osmunda? \nDocs:Podocarpus:Podocarpus ( ) is a genus of conifers, the most numerous and widely distributed of the podocarp family, Podocarpaceae.  \"Podocarpus\" are evergreen shrubs or trees, usually from 1 to tall, known to reach 40 m at times.  The cones have two to five fused cone scales which form a fleshy, berry-like, brightly coloured receptacle at maturity.  The fleshy cones attract birds which then eat the cones and disperse the seeds in their droppings.  There are approximately 97 to 107 species in the genus depending on the circumscription of the species.\nOsmunda wehrii:Osmunda wehrii is an extinct species of fern in the modern Osmundaceae family genus \"Osmunda\".  \"Osmunda wehrii\" is known from Langhian age Miocene fossils found in Central Washington.\nPodocarpus laetus:Podocarpus laetus is a species of conifer in the Podocarpaceae family, commonly known as Hall's tōtara, mountain tōtara or thin-barked tōtara.  Previously known as \"Podocarpus hallii\" and \"Podocarpus cunninghamii\", in 2015 it was realised that the much earlier name \"P. laetus\" has priority.\nOsmunda spectabilis:Osmunda spectabilis is a species of fern once thought to be the same as \"Osmunda regalis\", but recent genetic studies have shown it to be a separate species.\nOsmunda mildei:Osmunda mildei is a rare fern, known only from a few locations in the area of Hong Kong.  It is also a rarity in that it appears to be a species of hybrid origin within the Osmundaceae.  Its putative parents are \"Osmunda angustifolia\" (section \"Plenasium\") and \"O. japonica\" (section \"Osmunda\").\nPodocarpus elongatus:Podocarpus elongatus (Breeder River yellowwood) is a species of conifer in the Podocarpaceae family.  In contrast to other yellowwood species of Southern Africa, \"Podocarpus elongatus\" resembles an enormous, round, multi-stemmed bush in its habit.\nAnolis podocarpus:Anolis podocarpus is a species of lizard in the family Polychrotidae.  It was first described by Fernando P. Ayala-Varela and Omar Torres-Carvajal in 2010, the type locality being the Podocarpus National Park at Romerillos Alto in Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador on the southeastern slopes of the Andes.  The specific name refers to the \"Podocarpus\" trees which are found in the Park.\nList of plants known as tōtara:Tōtara is a Māori common name for the tree species \"Podocarpus totara\".  The term may also refer to other similar species in the genus \"Podocarpus\":\nPeristoreus flavitarsis:Peristoreus flavitarsis: Peristoreus flavitarsis is a species of true weevil.  It is endemic to New Zealand.  The larvae are leaf miners of \"Podocarpus totara\".  Similar leaf mines have also been found on \"Podocarpus acutifolius\" and \"Podocarpus cunninghamii\".\nFrond dimorphism:Frond dimorphism refers to a difference in ferns between the fertile and sterile fronds.  Since ferns, unlike flowering plants, bear spores on the leaf blade itself, this may affect the form of the frond itself.  In some species of ferns, there is virtually no difference between the fertile and sterile fronds, such as in the genus \"Dryopteris\", other than the mere presence of the sori, or fruit-dots, on the back of the fronds.  Some other species, such as \"Polystichum acrostichoides\" (Christmas fern), or some ferns of the genus \"Osmunda\", feature dimorphism on a portion of the frond only.  Others, such as some species of \"Blechnum\" and \"Woodwardia\", have fertile fronds that are markedly taller than the sterile.  Still others, such as \"Osmunda cinnamomea\" (Cinnamon fern), or plants of the family Onocleaceae, have fertile fronds that are completely different from the sterile.\n\nAnswer:"

Gobitis:Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586 (1940) , was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the religious rights of public school students under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Court ruled that public schools could compel students—in this case, Jehovah's Witnesses—to salute the American Flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance despite the students' religious objections to these practices.  This decision led to increased persecution of Witnesses in the United States.  The Supreme Court overruled this decision a mere three years later, in \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\", 319 U.S. 624 (1943).\nGravel v. United States:Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), was a case regarding the protections offered by the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution.  In the case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the privileges and immunities of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause enjoyed by members of Congress also extend to Congressional aides, but not to activity outside the legislative process.\nAbington School District v. Schempp:Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided 8–1 in favor of the respondent, Edward Schempp, and declared school-sponsored Bible reading in public schools in the United States to be unconstitutional.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court during this case was Earl Warren.\nElk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow:Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), was a case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The lawsuit, originally filed as Newdow v. United States Congress, Elk Grove Unified School District, et al. in 2000, led to a 2002 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance are an endorsement of religion and therefore violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  After an initial decision striking the congressionally added \"one nation under God\" language, [Newdow v. U.S. Congress, 292 F.3d 597 (9th Cir.  2002), the superseding opinion on denial of rehearing en banc was more limited, holding that compelled recitation of the language by school teachers to students was invalid.

Falvo, 534 U.S. 426 (2002) , was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held in favor of the school district that students scoring each other's tests and calling out the grades do not violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).  Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion for the unanimous court.  Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion in which he agreed with the ruling, but took issue with parts of Kennedy's opinion.\nForest Grove School District v. T. A.:Forest Grove School District v. T. A., 557 U.S. 230 (2009), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes reimbursement for private special education services when a public school fails to provide a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE) and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education services through the public school.\nSafford Unified School District v. Redding:Safford Unified School District v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a strip search of a middle schooler violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution where the school lacked reasons to suspect either that the drugs (Ibuprofen) presented a danger or that they were concealed in her underwear.  The court also held, however, that because this was not clearly established law prior to the court's decision, the officials involved were shielded from liability by qualified immunity.\nBethel School District v. Fraser:Bethel School District v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court involving free speech in public schools.  High school student Matthew Fraser was suspended from school in the Bethel School District for making a speech including sexual double entendres at a school assembly.

Garret F.: Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., 526 U.S. 66 (1999) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the related services provision in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) required public school districts to fund \"continuous, one-on-one nursing care for disabled children\" despite arguments from the school district concerning the costs of the services.\"  The judges relied heavily on Irving Independent School Dist.  v. Tatro, 468 U. S. 883 (1984).  Under the Court's reading of the IDEA's relevant provisions, medical treatments such as suctioning, ventilator checks, catheterization, and others which can be administered by non-physician personnel come within the parameters of the special education law's related services.  Disability advocates considered the Court decision to be a \"substantial victory for families of children with disabilities.\"  Amendments were made in the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 to increase IDEA funding as a result of the case.\nHenry W.

Sawyer worked as a corporate lawyer but is best known for his advocacy of civil liberties, especially in First Amendment cases.  In \"Abington School District v. Schempp\" and \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\", he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court of the United States that became the basis for all modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  He pursued civil rights causes in Philadelphia and in the South during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.  He also served a four-year term on Philadelphia City Council, where he worked for civil service reform and to increase the amount of public art in the city.\n\nAnswer:"

The songs have not appeared in any of the band's compilation albums and have not been performed live since Mike Morris left the band.\nList of songs recorded by Faith No More:Faith No More, a San Francisco-based band, have recorded approximately 100 songs over the course of their career; this includes material from six studio albums, one live album, and numerous B-side tracks and out-takes.  Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single \"Quiet in Heaven\" / \"Song of Liberty\".  Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, \"We Care a Lot\" and \"Introduce Yourself\", were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the \"metallic guitar\" of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music.  Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's \"The Real Thing\".  Their next studio album, \"Angel Dust\", moved away from the band's rap-influenced sound to experiment with different musical genres; a trend which became much more pronounced on the 1995 album \"King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime\".\nJefferson's Tree of Liberty:Jefferson's Tree of Liberty is the tenth album by Jefferson Starship, released on September 2, 2008.  It is the band's first studio album since 1999's \"Windows of Heaven\".  The new album includes cover songs from Irish, American, English, and Latin-American traditions.  The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"  The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba.  In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California.  About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\"  The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan.  On February 1, 2009, more tour dates and venues were announced by the band's manager Michael Gaiman, with additional plans to continue the tour through 2010 and bring it to Australia and South America.  David Grisman joined the band for the April 2009 tour dates.

Such beers may be similar to traditional beers such as Lambic and Oud bruin, and are typically fermented using a strain of \"brettanomyces\" for part or all of the fermentation.  The use of brettanomyces can result in a \"funky\" flavor profile.  Examples include Jolly Pumpkin Perseguidor, Avery 15 and Brabant, Ommegang Ommegeddon.\nLambic:Lambic is a type of beer brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium southwest of Brussels and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery.  Lambic beers include gueuze and kriek lambic.  Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast.  This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.\nRogue Beard Beer:Rogue Ales Beard Beer is an American wild ale brewed by Rogue Ales of Newport, Oregon using wild yeast originally cultured from nine beard hairs belonging to Rogue Ales' brewmaster, John Maier.\nWild Goose (beer):Wild Goose is a brand of beer brewed by the Logan Shaw Brewing Company of Washington, D.C..

This style is rarely brewed commercially today.  It was also locally known as \"Dark Cream Common Beer\", \"Cream Beer\" or \"Common Beer\".  The beer was top-fermented and wasn't krausened, i.e., it was fermented once and sent out for sale which meant the gravity would be moderate, the carbonation low and the taste full and sweetish.  Like cream ale, it was consumed fresh, usually as draught beer.  In 1913 it was estimated that 80% of the beer consumed in Louisville was of this type.  Many local breweries made this style of beer exclusively.\nHeavy Seas Beer:Heavy Seas Beer is brewed by Clipper City Brewing Company, in Baltimore, Maryland.

However, upon the arrival of a certain Filipino hero called, Galo, resistance started to organize.  Under Galo's command, they were able to resist China-born Limahong until Mexico-born Juan de Salcedo arrived from Ilocos with 300 Ilocano Warriors and Limahong was defeated and eventually forced to retreat.  Thereafter Limahong abandoned his plans to invade Manila and instead, set up a temporary kingdom in Pangasinan.\nBattle of Bataan:The Battle of Bataan (7 January – 9 April 1942) represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.  In January 1942, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.  The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders.  By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia.  The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.  Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward.  As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific.  The surrender at Bataan, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.  Soon afterwards, Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March.\nBattle of Attu:The Battle of Attu, which took place from 11–30 May 1943, was a battle fought between forces of the United States, aided by Canadian reconnaissance and fighter-bomber support, and the Empire of Japan on Attu Island off the coast of the Territory of Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign during the American Theater and the Pacific Theater and was the only land battle of World War II fought on incorporated territory of the United States.  It is also the only land battle in which Japanese and American forces fought in Arctic conditions.\nJapanese 20mm Cannon Blockhouse:The Japanese 20mm Cannon Blockhouse is one of many relics of World War II on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands.  It is a concrete blockhouse, semi-circular in shape with a diameter of about 6 m .  Its walls are 1.22 m thick with four firing ports large enough to accommodate 20mm cannons, originally equipped with steel sliding shutters.  A steel door 25 mm thick provides access to the structure at the rear, sheltered by a concrete wall and covered defensively by a machine gun port.  The blockhouse is located near the center of what is locally called Big Agingan Beach (Unai Dankulo Agingan), on the south coast of the island, about 20 m from the shore.  It was built in some haste by the Japanese forces defending Saipan in 1944, and was captured by Allied forces early in the Battle of Saipan.\nBattle of Hill 609:The Battle of Hill 609 took place at Djebel Tahent in northwestern Tunisia during the Tunisia Campaign.  The battle was for control over the key strategic height Hill 609 and its surrounding area between the American forces of the U.S. II Corps and German units of the Afrika Korps.  The battle proved a formative experience for the American forces - it their first clear cut victory of the campaign and has been called \"the American Army's coming-of-age\".\nBattle of Piqua:The Battle of Piqua, also known as the Battle of Pekowee or Pekowi, was part of the western campaign during the American Revolutionary War.  Led by General George Rogers Clark, over 1,000 soldiers (among them Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton) crossed the Ohio River near present-day Cincinnati and burned five Shawnee villages, including Old Chillicothe, along the Little Miami River.  Peter Loramie's Store, a British trading post-located in what was later Fort Loramie, Ohio in Shelby County, Ohio-, was also burned by Clark's men.  The Shawnee gradually withdrew during the first few days before finally engaging American forces 7 miles west of Springfield, Ohio on August 8, 1780.  Joseph Rogers, a cousin of George Rogers Clark, had previously accompanied him to Kentucky and was later captured by the Shawnee near Maysville.  Despite having been adopted by the tribe, he was killed during the battle while trying to join American forces.\nSouth German Offensive:The South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe.  The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the First Army of France.  Soviet troops linked up with American forces in Czechoslovakia notably in the Battle of Slivice.  The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the US 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps.  However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress.  However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction.  The VI Corps of the Seventh Army linked up with the US Fifth Army, which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into Austria and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east.  Fighting continued a few days after the Surrender of Germany on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets.\n\nAnswer:"

This protects pedestrians from the weather.  In North America skyways are usually owned by businesses, and are therefore not public spaces (compare with sidewalk).  However, in Asia, such as Bangkok's and Hong Kong's skywalks, they are built and owned separately by the city government, connecting between privately run rail stations or other transport with their own footbridges, and run many kilometers.  Skyways usually connect on the first few floors above the ground-level floor, though they are sometimes much higher, as in Petronas Towers.  The space in the buildings connected by skyways is often devoted to retail business, so areas around the skyway may operate as a shopping mall.  Non-commercial areas with closely associated buildings, such as university campuses, can often have skyways and/or tunnels connecting buildings.\nPiercing point:Piercing point: In geology, a piercing point is defined as a feature (usually a geologic feature, preferably a linear feature) that is cut by a fault, then moved apart.  Reconfiguring the piercing point back in its original position is the primary way geologists can find out the minimum slip, or displacement, along a fault.  This can be done on a large scale (over many kilometers), a small scale (inside a single outcrop or fault trench) or even a single hand sample/rock (see image).\nTelial stage:The Telial stage is one of the stages in the life cycle of a parasitic heteroecious fungus.  It is discernible by the formation of large teliospores that the fungi produces to overwinter.  The telial stage of heteroecious parasitic fungi is spent on the secondary host plant.  A primary aecial stage is spent parasitizing a separate host plant which is a precursor in the life cycle of heteroecious fungi.  Spores are released from the telia in the spring.  The spores can spread many kilometers through the air, however most are spread near the host plant (Brand, 2004).\n\nAnswer:"

The name is derived from the French and means bridge of the nose, and was probably given by the French boatmen who comprised keelboat crews in the fur trade in the upper Missouri River in Montana during the early decades of the 1800s.\nLittle Missouri Falls:The Little Missouri Falls is a sizable waterfall on the upper reaches of the Little Missouri River in southwest Arkansas in the Ouachita National Forest.  It is a stairstep fall in a deep gorge.  The falls can be reached by an all-weather gravel road, and there is a parking area with restrooms and a paved trail leading to observation sites.  Water flow is greatest during the winter and spring months.\nLittle Missouri River Bridge:The Little Missouri River Bridge, also known as the Nachitoch Bluff Bridge, is a historic bridge between rural southern Clark County, Arkansas and Nevada County, Arkansas.  Now closed to traffic, it once carried County Road 179 (apparently now numbered CR 479) over the Little Missouri River.  Believed to be built in 1910, it is the only known Camelback Pratt truss bridge in the state.  Its main span measures 185 ft , with a secondary Pratt truss span measuring 110 ft in length, and there are I-beam-supported approaches on either side, giving the bridge a total length of 315 ft .  The bridge is located on the historic route of the Natchitoches Trace, an early colonial French-Spanish trail through the area.\nUS 67 Bridge over Little Missouri River:The US 67 Bridge over Little Missouri River is a historic bridge carrying U.S. Route 67 (US 67) over the Little Missouri River, the border between Clark County and Nevada County, Arkansas.  It consists of three steel Parker Pony trusses, with a total length of 1161 ft .  Built in 1931, it is one of only seven surviving multi-span Parker truss bridges in the state.\nAntoine River (Arkansas):The Antoine River is a 50.4 mi tributary of the Little Missouri River in southwestern Arkansas in the United States.  Via the Little Missouri, Ouachita and Red rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.  According to the GNIS, it has also been known as Antoine Creek.  A short headwater tributary of the river is known as the Little Antoine River.\nCow Creek (Montana):Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 35 mi long, in north central Montana in the United States.  Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately 25 mi northeast of Winifred, Montana—or 22 mi upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge.  Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River.  The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri – at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier – a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains.  This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries.  During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west.  In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the \"Battle of Cow Island\", and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada–US border.  Today, modern highways have by passed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and the nomadic Indian are gone.  Cow Creek is dormant, in one of the most remote spots of the isolated regions of the vast area known as the Montana Missouri Breaks.\nMaramataha River:The Maramataha River is a river in the Manawatu-Wanganui Region of New Zealand.  The river rises west of Lake Taupo and flows generally west to become a tributary of the Ongarue River.\n\nAnswer:"

Drew later moved to Victoria and played premier cricket for Camberwell, and won the Jack Ryder Medal as Premier Cricket's best player in 2016/17.\nThe Cowsills:The Cowsills are an American singing group from Newport, Rhode Island.  They specialized in harmonies and the ability to sing and play music at an early age.  The band was formed in the spring of 1965 by brothers Bill, Bob, and Barry Cowsill; they shortly thereafter added their brother John.  Originally Bill and Bob played guitar and Barry was on drums.  When John learned how to play drums and joined the band, Barry went to bass.  After their initial success, the brothers were joined by their siblings Susan and Paul and their mother Barbara.  Bob's twin brother Richard was never the road manager, although this misinformation appears in several places on the internet.  The band's road manager was Richard 'Biggie' Korn.  When the group expanded to its full family membership by 1967, the six siblings ranged in age from 8 to 19.  Joined by their mother, Barbara Cowsill (née Russell), the group was the inspiration for the 1970s television show \"The Partridge Family\".\nTip of My Tongue (Lynsey de Paul song):\"Tip of My Tongue\" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue (originally registered as \"On the Tip of My Tongue\").  It was first released as the fifth single by Brotherly Love (a Liverpool-based group composed of three brothers, Mike, Ronnie and Lee Carroll) on CBS Records in 1973 and was produced by Phil Wainman.  It received positive reviews from the British music press and stalled just outside the Top 50 of the UK Singles Chart that year.  Barry Blue was credited as \"Barry Green\" on this release.  The female soul trio Ellie (aka the Hope Sisters - Ellie, Christine and Kathy) released their version of \"Tip of My Tongue\" as a single on the Fresh Air record label in the UK and on London Records in North America in 1974, and they performed the song on the German TV music program, \"Hits a Go Go\", on 22 October 1974.

Drew was the head coach of the Valparaiso Crusaders men's basketball team from 1988 to 2002 and 2003 to 2011.  His younger son, Bryce Drew, succeeded him as the head coach in May 2011.  His elder son Scott Drew is the head coach of Baylor University's men's basketball team after having served nine years assisting under Homer and one year as head coach of Valparaiso.  Homer Drew is best known for leading Valparaiso's improbable run in the 1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\nAustralian cricket team in Australia in 1962–63:The 1962-63 Australians drew 1-1 with the touring England team in the 1962-63 Ashes series.  Australia had beaten England 4-0 in 1958-59 and 2-1 in 1961 and it was thought unlikely that the tourists would beat Australia on their home ground.  Richie Benaud was a keen advocate of \"go ahead\" cricket and his attacking tactics and brilliant captaincy had won Australia five series in a row with what were seen as average teams.  Ironically, now he had a better team he drew his first series and his negative play in the last two Tests tarnished his reputation, though he did retain the Ashes.  This was the last Test series of Neil Harvey, Alan Davidson and Ken Mackay and Benaud himself played for only one more season.  There was a feeling that this was an end of an era and commentators wondered where the new batsmen and bowlers would come from.  Fears about the Australian batting proved short-lived as Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry formed one of Australia's great opening partnerships and were supported by Peter Burge, Brian Booth, Norm O'Neill and Barry Shepherd.  But they would soon be short of a decent bowling attack, which would rest on the broad shoulders of the 21-year-old fast-bowler Graham McKenzie until the emergence of Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson and Max Walker in the 1970s.\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:How many cards can a player choose from to be part of their hand in the card game that was the culmination game of the United States Poker Championship?\nDocs:Asia Poker:Asia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos.  Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low).  The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand.  After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand.  If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses.  If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins.  Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers.  Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand).  Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses.  The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.\nTexas hold 'em starting hands:In the poker game of Texas hold 'em, a starting hand consists of two \"hole cards\", which belong solely to the player and remain hidden from the other players.  Five community cards are also dealt into play.  Betting begins before any of the community cards are exposed, and continues throughout the hand.  The player's \"playing hand\", which will be compared against that of each competing player, is the best 5-card poker hand available from his two hole cards and the five community cards.  Unless otherwise specified, here the term \"hand\" applies to the player's two hole cards, or \"starting hand\".\nPyramid poker:Pyramid poker is a simplified version of pai gow poker, where instead of seven cards, three cards are dealt face down.  It uses a standard 52-card deck without jokers.  The hand rankings are just like in poker except that aces are always high.  The dealer deals the player and himself 3 cards, which is arranged into a 2 card hand and a 1 card hand which should be smaller than the 2-card hand.  There are no straights or flushes in the 2-card hand, and a higher ranked hand wins in both the hands.\nCommunity card poker:Community card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called \"shared cards\" or \"window cards\"), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players.  In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (\"hole cards\"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand.  The set of community cards is called the \"board\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern.  Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand.  The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.\nAnything's Wild:Anything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\".  The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand.  The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly.  The payoff is based on the value of the hand.  The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand.  Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play.  This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.\nTexas hold 'em:Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards (\"the flop\"), later an additional single card (\"the turn\" or \"fourth street\"), and a final card (\"the river\" or \"fifth street\").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called \"playing the board\".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)  Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.  Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.\nMuck (gambling):Muck in gambling has multiple meanings.  In poker, it most often refers to the pile of discarded cards into which players may throw their folded hands, and into which the dealer may place burned cards.  It may also refer to the action of throwing a hand into the muck.  When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet).  The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand.  In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand.  This is why many players will place a chip or other object on their cards: it helps to prevent errant cards from entering their hand.  Sometimes they are referred to as card covers, card guards or card protector.\nStar Wars Customizable Card Game:Star Wars: Customizable Card Game (SW:CCG) is a customizable card game based on the \"Star Wars\" fictional universe.  It was created by Decipher, Inc., which also produced the \"Star Trek Customizable Card Game\" and \"The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game\".  The game was produced from December 1995 until December 2001.  Operation and oversight of the game was then taken over by a Decipher created volunteer group called the Star Wars Customizable Card Game Players Committee.  To date, the Players Committee, or PC, still runs the game and creates new cards known as \"virtual cards\" that are released online in PDF format, and can then be printed and played with.  \"SW:CCG\" can also be played online: Holotable.com is the official Player Committee platform.\nBattleCards:BattleCards was marketed as a trading card game and published in 1993 by Merlin Publishing.  The game features a unique \"Scratch and Slay\" system created by Steve Jackson.  The cards come in 10 card booster packs which include warrior cards, spell cards, advanced combat cards, quest cards, and treasure cards.  The game was published in both the UK and the United States with a number of differences between the two releases.  Since the game is not played with a deck, and there is no collectibility involved (once the cards are scratched off they're worthless), this game does not strictly qualify as a collectible card game.  Darwin Bromley of Mayfair Games noted that when shuffled the scratch-offs would crack, and once scratched off \"you had to either play the game or collect it.\"  \"You couldn't have your cake and eat it too.\"\nSwipe it! Take what's yours... (card game):Swipe it! Take what's yours... (card game): Swipe it!  Take what's yours... is a card game developed by American creator Earl Johnson III of Los Angeles, California, and was published on December 20, 2014 by EJ3Games, a gaming company also founded by Johnson.  The game's name refers to the fact that players in the game are trying to \"Swipe\" or steal as many cards from each other as possible.  It is recognized by Boardgamegeek as a \"party and family\" card game.\n\nAnswer:"

It was released in 2001.  It was the first hardcore video ever listed on the Billboard music video sales chart.  Because of its huge success, it started a trend where rappers are put into the mainstream of the porn industry by hosting X-rated movies.  Many films of the genre followed, starring Necro, Mystikal, Too Short, Ice-T and Yukmouth.  It also allowed Hustler to expand its boundaries by launching new subsidiaries for their recently formed fashion line and CD label.  The scenes were shot at Snoop Dogg's house in Claremont, California.

The West Coast style in hip-hop that he developed from Dre's first album continued on \"Doggystyle\".  Critics have praised Snoop Doggy Dogg for the lyrical \"realism\" that he delivers on the album and for his distinctive vocal flow.  Despite some mixed criticism of the album initially upon its release, \"Doggystyle\" earned recognition from many music critics as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the most important hip-hop albums ever released.  Much like \"The Chronic\", the distinctive sounds of \"Doggystyle\" helped introduce the hip-hop subgenre of g-funk to a mainstream audience, bringing forward West Coast hip hop as a dominant force in the early-1990s.\nCoolaid:Coolaid is the fourteenth studio album by American West Coast hip hop recording artist Snoop Dogg.  It was released on July 1, 2016, by Doggystyle Records and eOne Music.  Recording sessions for the album took place during 2015 to 2016 at the Doggystyle Studios Records, in Diamond Bar, California.

He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal.  Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack.  Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career.  Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself.  By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's \"I Got Skillz\" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials.  Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend.  Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with \"Still a G Thang,\" one of the better songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told.  Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop—Tru's \"It's a Beautiful Thang,\" Silkk the Shocker's \"Get It Up\"—before playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: \"In Love With a Thug,\" \"Better Days,\" \"Gangsta Ride,\" among others.  In 2000 he reprised his role as one of Snoop's producers of choice, producing tracks for Tha Eastsidaz' self-titled debut and Doggy's Angels' Pleezbalevit, as well as Snoop's own Tha Last Meal (\"Go Away,\" \"Issues\").\nDead Man Walkin':Dead Man Walkin' is a compilation album released by Death Row Records on October 31, 2000, composed of archived Snoop Dogg recordings but was not authorized by Snoop Dogg, nor recognized on the discography on his website.  Snoop Dogg was an artist on Death Row from 1992 to 1998, when he left the label following labelmate Dr. Dre's departure and the death of Tupac Shakur.  The split between Snoop Dogg and Death Row head Suge Knight was less than amicable, and the title of this release was an unfriendly warning from Knight to Snoop Dogg, who had spoken out against the imposing Knight in several interviews and on record as well.  According to SoundScan (2005), it has sold 220,478 copies.  A music video was released for Head Doctor.\nGame Don't Wait:\"Game Don't Wait\" was the second single released from Warren G's third album, \"I Want It All\".  The remix of the song, which was the version released as a single was produced by Warren G's stepbrother Dr. Dre and featured fellow 213 members, Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg, as well as Xzibit.  It peaked at 58 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.  The original song was produced by Warren G and featured Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, but Xzibit was exclusive to the remix.\n\nAnswer:"

Mad Season released only one album, \"Above\", and is best known for the single \"River of Deceit\".  The band went on a semi-permanent hiatus in 1996 due to the band members' conflicting schedules and vocalist Layne Staley's problems with substance abuse.  Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group without Staley; however, the band dissolved following the death of bassist John Baker Saunders in 1999.  Staley died three years later of a drug overdose.\nJamboree (Beat Happening album):Jamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.

The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash \"In Between\" and the more typically understated \"Ask Me.\"  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as \"dark and sexy.\"  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener \"Bewitched,\" his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck.\nVan Conner:Van Conner (born March 17, 1967 in Apple Valley, California) is an American rock musician.

                "value": "Question:Woman's Era and Naj are what kind of magazines?\nDocs:Be Love:Be Love is a Japanese manga magazine targeting women published by Kodansha.  It debuted in September 1980.  It is one of the leading manga magazines for adult women, the first of its kind, and was instrumental in the rising popularity of josei manga in the 1980s, which led to the creation of other magazines targeted at women such as \"You\" and \"Big Comic for Lady\".  As of 2003, \"Be Love\", like \"You\" and \"Jour\", published stories focussing on \"the reality of everyday life\" experienced by its readers.\nPornographic magazine:Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature.  Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse.\nWhit Burnett:Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine \"Story\".  In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors.  Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".  While \"Story\" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era.\nAlternative press in Nigeria:The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage.  This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s.  The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings.  These magazines are known for their belligerent assault on national leadership and use of secret offices, sometimes called bush offices to print their publications.  Some critics have raised ethnic nationalism and cultural coloration as key factors which provided the impetus for most of the rhetoric.\nRichard Phillips (American painter):Richard Phillips (American painter): Richard Phillips (born 1962) is an American artist.  He was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts and lives and works in New York City.  Phillips is known for his large-scale glossy hyper-realistic paintings, recalling the pictorial style of magazines from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and reflecting traditions of popular image culture.  His paintings represent close-up portraits, predominantly of women from fashion and soft porno magazines, but also persons from the fields of pop music and politics.  He says \"My pictures involve a kind of wasted beauty - that's always been a thread in my work.\"\nLifestyle trends and media:Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media.  Media – films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world.  Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate.  Celebrity endorsements are prevalent.  Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.  At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like \"Life\", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination.  After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person.  The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication.  Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide.  The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible.  The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film.  With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared.  Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known.  Douglas Kellner writes, \"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \"us\" and \"them.\"\"\nChin (deity):In describing the customs of the Mayas inhabiting the Verapaz province (including the Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz) of 16th-century Guatemala, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas mentions sexual relationships, regulated by customary law, between unmarried young men and boys, as well as similar relations prevailing among adolescents receiving instruction in the temples.  Chin, together with Cu, Cavil ('idol'), and Maran, is mentioned as the name of the male deity said to have demonstrated sexual intercourse with another 'demon', and thereby to have introduced such relationships: \"From that time on some fathers gave their sons a little boy to be used as a woman; and if someone else took the boy, they demanded pay as is done when someone violates another's wife.\"  Institutionalized pederastic prostitution, including transvestism, is recorded in 17th-century Spanish reports of the Itzá Mayas living in the Petén.  Among the Classic Period scenes found in a cave of Naj Tunich is a depiction of a naked, sexually excited male creature embracing a nude Maya nobleman, possibly by way of initiation.\nRoller disco:A roller disco is a discothèque or skating rink where all the dancers wear roller skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline).  The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music.  The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines.  In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful.  Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights.  Some now use in-line roller-blades.  Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties.  As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used.  To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a \"free skate\" section in the middle of the roller rink.\nKathoey:Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: \"Kathoei\"  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand.  A significant number of Thais perceive \"kathoeys\" as belonging to a third gender, including many \"kathoeys\" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman.  However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as \"phuying\" (Thai: ผู้หญิง \"women\"), with a minority referring to themselves as \"phuying praphet song\" (a \"second kind of woman\") and only very few referring to themselves as \"kathoey\".  Related phrases include \"phet thi sam\" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , \"third gender\"), and \"sao praphet song\" or \"phu ying praphet song\" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning \"second-type female\").  The word \"kathoey\" is of Khmer origin.  It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia.\nMuseum of Decorative Arts, Isfahan:The museum of decorative arts in Isfahan was founded in 1995.  More than 3000 artworks from the Safavid and Qajar era are kept in the museum.  The building of the museum belongs to the era of Abbas I.  In the era of Abbas I and his successors, the building was used as the stable of Chehelsotoon palace and horse supplies were kept in its warehouse.  There is a multi-storey tower beside the museum, which belongs to the Qajar era.  The tower was used at first as watchtower and then as jail.  The tower does not have any kind of decorations, bit it is regarded as a notable relic of the Safavid architecture.\n\nAnswer:"

The town of Yellowknife did not exist yet at that point, but the discovery of gold at Burwash was the catalyst that brought more gold prospectors into the region in 1935 and 1936.  A short shaft was sunk in 1935-1936 at Burwash, and in the summer of 1935 a 16-ton bulk sample of ore was shipped to Trail, British Columbia for processing, yielding 200 troy ounces (6 kg) of gold.  The mine did not become a substantial producer and it is believed the gold vein was mined out.\nTemagami-Lorrain Mine:Temagami-Lorrain Mine is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.

The project has the potential to further enhance the long-term economics of Porcupine.  All material required permits, including the Advance Exploration permit, have been received to allow for the construction of a ramp into the deposit and the extraction of a 30,000 tonne bulk sample.  The ramp design for the purpose of the bulk sample is expected to be sufficient for ultimate mining purposes.  The underground platforms developed from the ramp access will further support exploration drilling of a deposit that remains open at depth and laterally.  A final feasibility study is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2019 after the completion of a bulk sample.  With the expected ramp completion and minimal additional infrastructure required for full scale mining, the company expects to reach commercial production six months following bulk sample extraction.\nGolden Fleece Mine (Colorado):The Golden Fleece Mine is a gold mining site in Hinsdale County, Colorado, 5 mi south of Lake City.

The last inspection of the Hastings Mine occurred in 1997 and found only slight erosion of the considerable mine tailings; however the tailings exceed 10000 cuyd of material, or one of the largest cinnabar tailings in the State of California.  Furthermore, the drainage from St. John's Mine flows to receiving waters of Rindler Creek and thence to Lake Chabot.  Miles of underground shafts were driven in the course of working the quicksilver deposits in the area.  In 1989, Earth Metrics reviewed old 1918 maps of workings of the Hastings and St. John's Mines and found that mine shafts were not driven into the site prior to the year 1918.\n\nAnswer:"

It was widely adopted into the laws of slavery in the colonies and the following United States.  The Latin phrase literally means \"that which is brought forth follows the womb\".\n\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Question:Erving Goffman was cited as higher than a literary critic on which guide?\nDocs:Erving Goffman:Erving Goffman (11 June 1922 – 19 November 1982) was a Canadian-American sociologist and writer, considered by some \"the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century\".  In 2007 he was listed by \"The Times Higher Education Guide\" as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, and ahead of Jürgen Habermas.\nGoffman (disambiguation):Erving Goffman (1922–1982) was a Canadian sociologist\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life:The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction.  Originally published in Scotland in 1956 and in the United States in 1959, it is Goffman’s first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association’s MacIver award in 1961.\nDramaturgy (sociology):Dramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life.  The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.\nTotal institution:A total institution is a place of work and residence where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.  The concept is mostly associated with the work of sociologist Erving Goffman.\nRay Birdwhistell:Ray Birdwhistell (September 28, 1918 – October 19, 1994) was an American anthropologist who founded kinesics as a field of inquiry and research.  Birdwhistell coined the term \"kinesics\", meaning \"facial expression, gestures, posture and gait, and visible arm and body movements\".  He estimated that \"no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.\"  Stated more broadly, he argued that \"words are not the only containers of social knowledge.\"  He proposed other technical terms, including kineme, and many others less frequently used today.  Birdwhistell had at least as much impact on the study of language and social interaction generally as just nonverbal communication because he was interested in the study of communication more broadly than is often recognized.  Birdwhistell understood body movements to be culturally patterned rather than universal.  His students were required to read widely, sources not only in communication but also anthropology and linguistics.  Collaborations with others, including initially Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and later, Erving Goffman and Dell Hymes had huge influence on his work.  For example, the book he is best known for, \"Kinesics and Context\", \"would not have appeared if it had not been envisaged by Erving Goffman\" and he explicitly stated \"the paramount and sustaining influence upon my work has been that of anthropological linguistics\", a tradition most directly represented at the University of Pennsylvania by Hymes.\nImpression management:Impression management is a conscious or subconscious process in which people attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event.  They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction.  It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1959, and then was expanded upon in 1967.  An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer.  At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching.  This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills.  Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game.\nPoliteness theory:Politeness theory accounts for the redressing of affronts to a person's 'face' by face-threatening acts.  The concept of face was derived from Chinese into English in the 19th century.  Erving Goffman would then go on to introduce the concept into academia through his theories of 'face' and 'facework'.  Although politeness has been studied in a variety of cultures for many years, Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson's politeness theory has become very influential.  In 1987, Brown and Levinson proposed that politeness was a universal concept, which has created controversy within academia.  Politeness is the expression of the speakers' intention to mitigate face threats carried by certain face threatening acts toward the listener.  Another definition is \"a battery of social skills whose goal is to ensure everyone feels affirmed in a social interaction\".  Therefore, being polite can be an attempt for the speaker to save their own face or the face of who he or she is talking to.\nIdentity management theory:Identity management theory (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an intercultural communication theory from the 1990s.  It was developed by William R. Cupach and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's \"Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior\" (1967).  Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural communication (speakers from different cultures) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture).\nIdentity Performance:Identity Performance: In everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance.  In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them.  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.\n\nAnswer:"

He was still bishop in the reign of King Causantín II of Scotland in 906 when, \"in his sixth year king Causantín and bishop Cellach upon the hill of credulity near the royal city of Scone, pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the rights in churches and gospels, should be kept in conformity with the [customs of the] Gaels\".  One interpretation of this passage is the demise of the \"Pictish church\" to the reforming Gaels, however it is certain that by the 15th century the bishop-list of the principal Scottish see was looking back at Cellach as its first bishop.  His death date is unknown, but unsurprisingly he was certainly dead by the 960s when his successor Fothad I died as bishop.\nSamuel Parker (Hawaii):Samuel Parker, known as Kamuela Parker (June 23, 1853 – March 19, 1920) was a major landowner and businessman on the island of Hawaii, heir to the Parker Ranch estate.  He was also a leading political figure at a critical time of the history of the Kingdom of Hawaii, serving in its last cabinet.\nSamuel Parker (Oregon politician):Samuel Parker (1806–1886) was an American pioneer of the Oregon Country, in what was to become the state of Oregon.  Parker would later participate in the legislatures of the provisional, territorial, and state governments of Oregon.\nEly S. Parker:Ely Samuel Parker (1828 – August 31, 1895), (born Hasanoanda, later known as \"Donehogawa\") was a Seneca attorney, engineer, and tribal diplomat.  He was commissioned a lieutenant colonel during the American Civil War, when he served as adjutant to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.  He wrote the final draft of the Confederate surrender terms at Appomattox.  Later in his career, Parker rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general.  President Grant appointed him as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to hold that post.\nBarony of Bannockburn:The Barony of Bannockburn is a Scottish feudal barony located in the historical county of Stirlingshire.  The first barons of Bannockburn were from the Sandilands and Vere families, descendants of a man named James who around 1348 had been granted the territory of Sandilands, Lesmahagow Lanarkshire, taking the territorial name as his surname.  He was also later granted the barony of Calder near Edinburgh.  The link of the Sandilands to Bannockburn was established on 14 July 1489, when King James IV confirmed James Sandelands of Calder and his wife Margaret Kerr his wife in the lands of Bannockburn.  By 7 July 1509, James Calder had transferred Bannockburn to his son.  On that date, King James IV confirmed a charter by Sir James Sandelands of Calder granting various lands including the barony of Ouchterbannok alias Bannockburn to his son James Sandelands.  On 23 August 1510, King James IV granted Sir James Sandelands of Caldour (nephew of Sir James Sandelands and his wife Mariota Forrester), various lands including the lands and barony of Bannockburn.  Robert De Vere the 6th.  Earl of Oxford accompanied Edward the 2nd.  on his campaign which culminated in defeat by the victorious King Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn on the 23rd and 24th.  of June 1314.  It is by a quirk of fate that the barony of Bannockburn was granted to the Sandilands as they were close relatives to the senior Scottish branch of the Veres both in blood and territorial location their estates in Lanarkshire being contiguous.\nSamuel Parker House (Reading, Massachusetts):Samuel Parker House (Reading, Massachusetts): The Samuel Parker House is a historic house at 132 West Street in Reading, Massachusetts.  The front, gambrel-roofed portion of this house, was probably built in the mid-1790s, and the house as a whole reflects a vernacular Georgian-Federal style.  The house is noted for a succession of working-class owners (of which Samuel Parker, a cooper, was one).  Its most notable resident was Carrie Belle Kenney, one of the earliest female graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nParker–Hutchinson Farm:The Parker–Hutchinson Farm is a historic farm property on Parker Bridge Road in Coventry, Connecticut.  It includes the Samuel Parker House which dates from 1850.  The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  The listing included an 8 acre area with a \"Cape\" farmhouse, and a number of outbuildings, including a horse barn, a sheep barn, and a shed.  There also are foundations of former buildings.\n21st Century King James Version:The 21st Century King James Version is a minor update of the King James Version which stays true to the Textus Receptus and does not delete Bible passages based on Alexandrian Greek manuscripts.  However, unlike the New King James Version, it does not alter the language significantly from the 1611 King James Version, retaining Jacobean grammar (including \"thee\" and \"thou\"), but it does attempt to replace some of the vocabulary which might no longer make sense to a modern reader.  The reader should notice almost no difference from reading the King James Version except that certain archaic words have been replaced with words that are more understandable.  The translation is directed towards readers who are looking for a very conservative King James update, but who would like to reduce the need to use a dictionary to look up obsolete words.\n\nAnswer:"

The bands are named for Victor Schumann and Carl Runge.\nRobert Schumann in Three Pieces:Robert Schumann in Three Pieces is the collective title given to three works, composed for the \"Avenue A\" ensemble by the British composer, Matthew King.  Together, they constitute a musical portrait of the German Romantic composer, Robert Schumann.  The first piece, entitled \"Ash on the Ground\" is a passacaglia in which various compositions by Schumann are quoted; the second piece, entitled \"Love in a Life\" has a soprano soloist, and is a miniature song cycle to texts by Robert Schumann himself, along with poems by Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  It has been described, by one critic, as \"rich and sumptuous, with some spine-tingling moments\" the third piece, entitled \"Night Phantoms and Rocking Horses\" is a rapid musical survey of Schumann's piano music at a furious galloping tempo.  The work ends with fragments of celeste and percussion sounding like a wound-down music box.\nRunge's theorem:Runge's theorem: In complex analysis, Runge's theorem (also known as Runge's approximation theorem) is named after the German mathematician Carl Runge who first proved it in the year 1885.  It states the following:\nDa Crime Posse:Da Crime Posse was one well-known group in the genre of Oriental Hip Hop in Germany.  The group was composed of two Turkish people (M.Ali and InceEfe), one German person (Olcay/Ole), and one Cuban person (Babalu).  In his essay addressing the development of hip-hop in Germany, author Timothy S. Brown suggests that many musical groups in Germany are adopting a sort of “symbolic ethnicity” which asserts that one “does not necessarily have to be Turkish” to assume the Turkish identity.  Furthermore, a scholar named Dietmar Elfein has cited Da Crime Posse as an example of how the “Turkish identity proposed is a mythological one” in the sense that one did not necessarily have to be Turkish to assume this symbolic ethnicity.  Perhaps one of the most important musical collaborations that Da Crime Posse has taken part in has been that with Karakan and Erci E.  Cina-i Sebeke (of Da Crime Posse) was the individual who met fellow Turkish hip-hop artists Karakan and Erci-E and spurred their musical collaboration.  Together, they established the legendary group Cartel and released a compilation album in 1995.  The only single from their self-titled album, composed by Big Porno Ahmet, brought the biggest success in the history of Turkish hip-hop.  With this unexpected success, they achieved Gold and Platinum status (plus many more awards) by selling more than 2,250,000 copies.\nMax Coyne:Max Coyne was a young man who ran messages through Bordeaux for the French Resistance during the Second World War.  One day he was stopped by German soldiers whilst carrying messages.  He managed to steal a gun and shoot one German, injuring him.  The soldiers gave chase, caught and shot Max.  He was seventeen years old.  There is now a street in Bordeaux named after Max (rue Max Coyne, 33100).\nHMS Ivanhoe (D16):HMS \"Ivanhoe\" was an I-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s.  During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.  Before the start of World War II, the ship was modified so that she could be used to lay mines by removing some of her armament.  \"Ivanhoe\" was transferred to Western Approaches Command shortly after the war began and helped to sink one German submarine in October 1939.  She was converted to a minelayer while undergoing a refit in November–December and laid minefields in German coastal waters as well as anti-submarine minefields off the British coast until she was reconverted back to her destroyer configuration in February 1940.  \"Ivanhoe\" reverted to her minelaying role during the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940 and then laid a number of minefields off the Dutch coast during the Battle of the Netherlands in May.  The ship participated in the Dunkirk evacuation until she was badly damaged by German aircraft on 1 June.  On her first minelaying mission after her repairs were completed, she struck a German mine and had to be scuttled on 1 September 1940 during the Texel Disaster.\nMollie's Nipple:Mollie's Nipple or Molly's Nipple is the name given to as many as seven peaks, at least one butte, at least one well, and some other geological features in Utah.  Some sources claim there are eleven geological features in Utah that bear this name.  At least some of those names are attributed to John Kitchen – a pioneer of an early exploration of Utah, who named them to commemorate a nipple of his wife (or his bride according to some sources) Molly.\nHMS Beagle (H30):HMS \"Beagle\" was a B-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy (RN) around 1930.  Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936.  During World War II, the ship spent the bulk of the war on escort duty, participating in the Norwegian Campaign, the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Torch, the Russian Convoys, and in the Normandy landings before accepting the surrender of the German garrison of the Channel Islands the day after the formal German surrender on 9 May together with another ship.  One exception to this pattern was when she helped to evacuate British soldiers and civilians during the Battle of France in 1940.  During the war, \"Beagle\" assisted in sinking one German submarine and claimed to have shot down two German aircraft.  Redundant after the war, she was broken up for scrap in 1946.\nList of New Zealand national cricket captains:This is a complete list of all of New Zealand's national cricket captains at official international level.

It is operated by BNSF Railway as part of their Northern Transcon.  The original line (built in 1893) was built as part of James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway transcontinental railway line.\nWishram station:Wishram is a train station in Wishram, Washington served by Amtrak's \"Empire Builder\" line.  The station consists of a platform adjacent to a modern, pre-fabricated building that contains BNSF offices.  Although Wishram is one of the smallest communities served by Amtrak, it is an important gateway to the scenic recreational opportunities offered by the Columbia River.\nC&amp;M Subdivision:The Chicago and Milwaukee Subdivision (commonly referred to as the C&M Subdivision or C&M Sub) is a railway line running between Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It is operated by Canadian Pacific Railway through its primary United States subsidiary, the Soo Line Railroad.  This had previously been owned by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, commonly known as the Milwaukee Road.  It carries Amtrak's \"Empire Builder\" and \"Hiawatha Service\", as well as commuter trains operated on part of Metra's Milwaukee District/North Line into Chicago.  The Union Pacific Railroad operates their Milwaukee Subdivision, a former Chicago and North Western line, parallel to this route just to the east.\nAlleghany Subdivision:The Alleghany Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia.  It was formerly part of the CSX Huntington East Division.  It become part of the CSX Florence Division on June 20, 2016.  The line runs from Clifton Forge, Virginia to Hinton, West Virginia for a total of 78.6 miles.  At its north end it continues south from the James River Subdivision and at its south end it continues south as the New River Subdivision.\nPasco Intermodal Train Station:Pasco Intermodal Train Station is a train station on the Amtrak's \"Empire Builder\" line in Pasco, Washington, USA.  The station stop serves the Tri-Cities of Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick.  The station and parking are owned by the City of Pasco.  The track and platforms are owned by BNSF Railway.  Greyhound Lines provides inter-city bus transport at the station.  Pasco is also a change point for Amtrak engineers on the \"Empire Builder\".\nCastleton Subdivision:The Castleton Subdivision is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in the U.S. state of New York.  The line runs from Schodack northwest to Selkirk along a former New York Central Railroad line.  At its southeast end, it junctions with the Berkshire Subdivision and Schodack Subdivision.  After crossing the Hudson River on the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge, it meets the River Subdivision and Port Subdivision at Selkirk and ends at Selkirk Yard, where the Selkirk Subdivision begins.\nColumbia Plateau (ecoregion):The Columbia Plateau ecoregion is a Level III ecoregion designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington, with small areas over the Washington state border in Idaho.  The ecoregion extends across a wide swath of the Columbia River Basin from The Dalles, Oregon to Lewiston, Idaho to Okanogan, Washington near the Canada–US border.  It includes nearly 500 mi of the Columbia River, as well as the lower reaches of major tributaries such as the Snake and Yakima rivers and the associated drainage basins.  It is named for the Columbia River Plateau, a flood basalt plateau formed by the Columbia River Basalt Group during the late Miocene and early Pliocene.  The arid sagebrush steppe and grasslands of the region are flanked by moister, predominantly forested, mountainous ecoregions on all sides.  The underlying basalt is up to 2 mi thick and partially covered by thick loess desposits.  Where precipitation amounts are sufficient, the deep loess soils have been extensively cultivated for wheat.  Water from the Columbia River is subject to resource allocation debates involving fisheries, navigation, hydropower, recreation, and irrigation, and the Columbia Basin Project has dramatically converted much of the region to agricultural use.\nNashville Terminal Subdivision:Nashville Terminal Subdivision: The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.\nEast Junction Branch:The East Junction Branch is a railroad line owned and operated by the Providence and Worcester Railroad in the U.S. state of Rhode Island and by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Massachusetts.  The line runs from the P&W's East Providence Branch in East Providence, Rhode Island northeast to Amtrak's Shore Line (Northeast Corridor) at East Junction in Attleboro, Massachusetts along a former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad line.  In Massachusetts, CSX Transportation operates local freight service via trackage rights, which it also has on the Shore Line north towards Boston.  The P&W has overhead trackage rights in Massachusetts over the East Junction Branch, Shore Line, and CSX's Middleboro Subdivision, New Bedford Subdivision, and Fall River Subdivision to the state line in Fall River, to reach its line to Newport, Rhode Island.\nSwanson, Ontario:Swanson is a settlement and unincorporated place in the Unorganized North Part of Algoma District, northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It lies at the south end of Esnagi Lake on the Magpie River where the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental main line crosses the river, between the settlements of Ryerson on the line 14 km to the west and Franz, the junction of the CPR with the Algoma Central Railway, 9 km to the east.  Canadian Pacific Railway has built, operates and maintains a signalled siding at Swanson as part of their White River Subdivision.  The signals and switches at Swanson and other signalled siding locations on the White River Subdivision are under Centralized Traffic Control (CTC), a train control system operated by a Rail Traffic Controller situated in the Canadian Pacific Railway headquarters in Calgary, Alberta.  Via Rail provides passenger train services with the Sudbury – White River train.\n\nAnswer:"

The first workers strike, in West Virginia, was the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 1912-1913.  With help from Mary \"Mother\" Jones, an important figure in unionizing the mine workers, the miners demanded better pay, better work conditions, the right to trade where they pleased (ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from company-owned stores), and recognition of the United Mine Workers (UMW).  The mining companies, however, refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired Baldwin-Felts Agents, equipped with high-powered rifles, to guard the mines, but more important to be strikebreakers.  After the Agents arrived, the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies, moving into coal camps that were being supported by the Union.  Approximately 35,000 people lived in these coal camps.  It wasn't until a month after the strike began that it became hostile with the arrival of the Baldwin-Felts Agents who provoked the miners.

Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada.  Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care.  By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners.  The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia.  However it was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.\n\nAnswer:"

The first high-speed rail lines in Europe, built in the 1980s and 1990s, improved travel times on intra-national corridors.  Since then, several countries have built extensive high-speed networks, and there are now several cross-border high-speed rail links.  Railway operators frequently run international services, and tracks are continuously being built and upgraded to international standards on the emerging European high-speed rail network.  In 2007, a consortium of European railway operators, Railteam, emerged to co-ordinate and boost cross-border high-speed rail travel.  Developing a Trans-European high-speed rail network is a stated goal of the European Union, and most cross-border railway lines receive EU funding.  Several countries — France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia and the United Kingdom — are connected to a cross-border high-speed railway network.  More are expected to be connected in the coming years as Europe invests heavily in tunnels, bridges and other infrastructure and development projects across the continent, many of which are under construction now.  Alstom was the first manufacturer to design and deliver a high speed train or HS-Train, which ended up in service with TGV in France.  Currently, there are a number of high-level manufacturers designing and building HSR in Europe, with criss-crossed alliances and partnerships, including Canadian company Bombardier, Alstom itself, the Spanish Talgo and the German Siemens.\nSoviet infrastructure in Central Asia:The legacy of the Soviet Union lives on in the infrastructure of Central Asia.  As it crumbles, or gets patched up, much of what was built in Central Asia is the backbone of the existing infrastructure for transportation, goods delivery and energy distribution.  Much of the industrial infrastructure underwent precipitous decline in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, especially in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.  The roads, railroads and energy lines are thus oriented towards the Russian Federation and away from other regional neighbors, such as China, Afghanistan or Iran.\nRail Users Ireland:Rail Users Ireland (previously Platform 11) is a rail transport pressure group in Ireland whose agenda is centred on the idea that there is an economic case for expanding rail transport in Ireland through better utilisation of existing infrastructure with only justified expansion of existing routes.  Through press releases, lobbying and leafleting they have promoted the DART Underground, a proposal to build a tunnel south of the Liffey to link up Dublin's Heuston Station with the existing DART and Luas lines.  The group is a member of the European Passengers Federation a European level representative body for rail users which shares the same outlook in terms of sustainable transport provision and improving standards on public transport.\nSTREAMS Integrated Intelligent Transport System:STREAMS® Integrated Intelligent Transport System is an enterprise traffic management system designed to operate in the Microsoft Windows environment.

It \"involves physically changing infrastructure to make it less susceptible to damage from extreme wind, flooding, or flying debris.  Hardening measures include adopting new technology, installing new equipment, constructing protective barriers, or changing communications/IT at the facility.  Hardening usually requires significant investment by the energy company.  Some projects take years to complete; for example, large earth-moving equipment may be brought in to build a new levee.  Sometimes the sheer magnitude of assets involved (e.g., thousands of wooden distribution poles) requires years of concerted effort to upgrade.\"\nCommunity Health Initiative (CHI):Impact India Foundation's Community Health Initiative (CHI) covers 1.5 million backward tribals in the State.

The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals.\nParacaleana:Paracaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.  The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to \"Caleana major\", but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  \"Paraceleana\" orchids, as well as hammer orchids (\"Drakaea\") are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers.\nCaladenia:Caladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state.\nCypripedioideae:Lady's slipper orchids (also known as lady slipper orchids or slipper orchids) are orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae, which comprises the genera \"Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium\" and \"Selenipedium\".  They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labellums) of the flowers – the pouch traps insects so they are forced to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower.\nCalochilus:Calochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.  Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia.\nWilliam Henry Nicholls:William Henry Nicholls: William Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 – 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to \"The Victorian Naturalist\", many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, \"Orchids of Australia\" in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include \"Caladenia caudata\", \"Caladenia echidnachila\", \"Caladenia ensata\", \"Caladenia ferruginea\", \"Caladenia magniclavata\", \"Caladenia ornata\", \"Caladenia praecox\", \"Caladenia radiata\", \"Pterostylis fischii\", \"Pterostylis hamiltonii\", \"Pterostylis hildii\" and \"Pterostylis tenuissima\".\n\nAnswer:"

The town suffered damages in the flash flood of May 25, 2004, which killed many citizens during the night and washed away hundreds of homes.\nTanks of Bombay:Although the tanks have long vanished, the city of Bombay (now Mumbai) once had many water tanks within its city limits.  They were once the only source of water to the city.  The only testimony to their existence is the names of the roads in their vicinity, which befuddles many citizens as to the original location to these mystifying relics of the past.\nWashington, Alabama:Washington is a ghost town located in Autauga County, Alabama on the north bank of the Alabama River, just west of the mouth of Autauga Creek.  Washington was founded in 1817 on the site of the former Autauga Indian town of Atagi and named in honor of George Washington.  On November 22, 1819, the Alabama territorial legislature chose Washington as the county seat of Autauga County, which it remained until 1830.  A courthouse, hotel, jail, post office and pillory were constructed to meet the needs of the county government.  The county seat was moved to Kingston in 1830 in order to be closer to the geographic center of the county.  Soon after, many citizens began to leave, and Washington was deserted by 1879.  The post office in Washington was operated from 1824 to 1854.\n\nAnswer:"

He was followed by the missionary, linguist and folklorist Paul Olaf Bodding.  He studied at the missionary school of Johannes Evangelista Goßner in Berlin, where he was prepared for his mission.\nHistory of sport:History of sport: The history of sports may extend as far back as the beginnings of military training, with competition used as a mean to determine whether individuals were fit and useful for service.  Team sports may have developed to train and to prove the capability to fight and also to work together as a team (army).  The history of sport can teach us about social changes and about the nature of sport itself, as sport seems involved in the development of basic human skills.  Of course, as one goes further back in history, dwindling evidence makes theories of the origins and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support.\nLars Eikind:Lars Eikind, also known as Lars Eric Si, has been a part of the Scandinavian rock/metal scene for many years both as musician and producer.  He has been involved in numerous bands, either as a full-time or session member.\nLars Samuelson (physicist):In 1977 Lars Samuelson was awarded his PHD at Lund University.  Afterwards he was a postdoc at the IBM Research facility in San José, California between 1978-1979 and a professor of semiconductor physics at Chalmers University of Technology in 1986.  In 1988 he became a professor of semiconductor electronics at the Department of Physics at Lund University, and in the same year was involved in the creation of Scandinavia's first research center, Nanometer Consortium.  In 2000 he began to focus the Nanometer Consortium's research on Nanowires.  In 2002, he became one of the first in the world to show how to combine substances with different electrical properties in a nanowire.  Based on the research of nanowires, Samuelson founded three companies: Qunano, Sol Voltaics and Glo.

The sport was introduced to the country after the World War I, when the country was under British colonial rule.  The sport was intended for leisure and first played in schools.  For this reason, almost all primary schools in the country have a court.  Recruitment for the national team and other high level teams started at that level.  Netball Association of Tanzania (CHANETA) was created in 1966.  Women have historically dominated in leadership positions in CHANETA but men are still involved, especially in roles like coaching.  During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a push by the International Olympic Committee and the British Council to promote sport and women's sport in Tanzania.  Despite netball being the most popular women's sport at the time, no investment was made into the sport.\nNils Trygg:Nils Trygg (1914–1951) was one of the recognized masters of twentieth century woodcarving, most famous for the Scandinavian flat-plane style of woodcarving.  Nils Trygg was born in Småland, Sweden.  He was one of three sons of Carl Johan Trygg and Maria Axelina Andersson.  Nils worked with his father carving wooden figures of various common people in the Scandinavian flat-plane style of woodcarving.  Between Nils Trygg, his father and two brothers (Lars, and Carl Olaf), they carved over 10,000 figures.  Many of his carvings were sold to tourists for approximately $10 USD.  Adjusted for inflation what cost $10 in 1929 would cost $108 in 2005.\n\nAnswer:"

It is a through arch bridge with a main arch span of 361 yards (330 m).  It was opened in 1961 as a replacement for the Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge, and was initially known simply as the Runcorn Bridge or Runcorn–Widnes Bridge.  In 1975–77 it was widened, after which it was given its official name in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee.  It carries the A533 road and a cantilevered footway.  The bridge is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.\nMersey Gateway:The Mersey Gateway is a multi-million pound transport scheme between Runcorn and Widnes in Cheshire, England.  The main part of the project is the construction of the \"Mersey Gateway\" toll bridge that will span the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal.  The crossing, which will have three traffic lanes in each direction, will be located approximately 1.5 km to the east of the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge.  Apart from the new bridge, the project also includes major civil engineering work realigning the existing road network, constructing new interchanges and landscaping 9 km of highway.\nCatalyst Science Discovery Centre:The Catalyst Science Discovery Centre (originally known as The Museum of the Chemical Industry) is a science centre and museum focusing on chemistry and the history of the chemical industry.  It is located near Spike Island in Widnes, Cheshire, and next to the River Mersey.  The museum is accredited by the Arts Council England.\nCuerdley railway station:One source gives Cuerdley railway station as being on what is now the southeastern edge of Widnes, England, stating that it was located near the then bone works which the 1849 OS Map shows as at the convergence of Moss Lane, the railway, the Sankey Canal, a creek and the north bank of the tidal River Mersey.  Of these only Moss Lane is no longer readily identifiable on a modern OS Map.  The authoritative \"Disused Stations\" website does not include an article on Cuerdley station, however, it does repeatedly use a map which places Cuerdley station some distance nearer Warrington.  This is corroborated by the Engineer's Line Reference (ELR) database which gives Cuerdley station as 1 mile 10 chains from Fiddlers Ferry and Penketh station and 1 mile 31 chains from Carterhouse Junction.  Furthermore, the ELR data gives the station site as only 31 chains west of the modern-day junction for Fiddlers Ferry Power station.\nRuncorn:Runcorn is an industrial town and cargo port in Cheshire, England, located within the Borough of Halton.  In 2010, Runcorn's population was estimated to be 61,000.  The town is on the southern bank of the River Mersey, where the estuary narrows to form the Runcorn Gap.  Directly to the north across the River Mersey is the town of Widnes.  Upstream and 8 mi to the northeast is the town of Warrington, and downstream 16 mi to the west is the city of Liverpool.\nFiddlers Ferry power station:Fiddlers Ferry Power Station is a coal fired power station located in Warrington, Cheshire, in North West England, which is capable of co-firing biomass.  It is situated on the north bank of the River Mersey between the towns of Widnes and Warrington.  Opened in 1971, the station has a generating capacity of 1,989 megawatts (MW).  In a bid to combine efforts at the design and construction stages the Boiler and Turbo-generator plant were replicated at West Burton power station located between Retford and Gainsborough in North Nottinghamshire.\nDeschutes River (Washington):The Deschutes River is a 50 mi river in Washington, United States.  Its source is in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Lewis County, and it empties into Budd Inlet of Puget Sound at Olympia in Thurston County.  It was given its name by French fur traders, who called it Rivière des Chutes, or \"River of the Falls\", a translation of the First Nations name for the site.  (The city of Tumwater, founded in the same location, takes its name from another translation for \"waterfall\", this one in Chinook Jargon.)\nCottonwood River (Minnesota):Cottonwood River (Minnesota): The Cottonwood River is a tributary of the Minnesota River, 152 miles (245 km) long, in southwestern Minnesota in the United States.  Via the Minnesota River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 1313 sqmi in an agricultural region.  The river's name is a translation of the Sioux name for the river, Waraju, for the cottonwood tree, which is common along prairie rivers.  It has also been known historically as the Big Cottonwood River.\nMotijhil:Motijhil (also Motijheel, literal translation: Pearl Lake), also known as Company Bagh due to its association with the East India Company, is a horse-shoe shaped lake in Murshidabad, West Bengal, India.  It was created by Nawazish Muhammad Khan, the son-in-law of Nawab Alivardi Khan.  He also constructed a precious palatial palace beside this lake which is called the \"Sang-i- dalan\" (literal translation:stone palace) which is also known as the \"Motijhil Palace\".  It is located at the bend of this lake.  It was used as the residence of Nawazish and Ghaseti Begum, Nawazish's beloved wife.  It is said that after Nawazish died, Ghaseti Begum lived here until Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah took over the palace and seized humongous amount of treasures in 1756 AD.  With this money he built a similar lake with a beautiful palace, Hirajheel, on the opposite side of the Bhagirathi River.  The palace has a lofty gateway, a mosque known as the \"\"Shahamat Jang\"\" and the \"Kala Masjid\" and some other buildings which were all built by Nawazish.  This palace was built in 1740.  As far as etymology is concerned, the palace has been named so as it was built using black basalt pillars which were brought from the ruins of Gaur.  Thus, it was given the name of \"Sang-i-Dalan\" or the Stone Palace.  This palace was then decorated with different varieties of flower plants and precious marbles.  Inside the palace is a huge room having no doors or windows in it and closed on all the four sides.  Some say that huge quantity of wealth belonging to the Begum had been kept hidden underground the room.  Once labourers were employed to break open the masonry and excavate the treasure, but they ended up vomiting blood, so nobody dares to open it.  The room is 65 feet long, 23 feet broad, 12 feet high plinth area, 1339 square feet.\nLac qui Parle River:The Lac qui Parle River is a tributary of the Minnesota River, 118 miles (190 km) long, in southwestern Minnesota in the United States.  A number of tributaries of the river, including its largest, the West Branch Lac qui Parle River, also flow in eastern South Dakota.  Via the Minnesota River, the Lac qui Parle River is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 1,156 sqmi in an agricultural region.  Slightly more than two-thirds of the Lac qui Parle watershed is in Minnesota.  \"Lac qui parle\" means \"the lake which speaks\" in the French language, and was a translation of the Sioux name for Lac qui Parle, a lake on the Minnesota River upstream of the mouth of the Lac qui Parle River.\n\nAnswer:"

It has its origin in the Rila Mountains in Western Bulgaria, flowing southeast between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains, past Plovdiv and Parvomay (where the Mechka and the Kayaliyka join it) to Edirne, Turkey.  East of Svilengrad, Bulgaria, the river flows eastwards, forming the border between Bulgaria (on the north bank) and Greece (on the south bank), and then between Turkey and Greece.  At Edirne, the river flows through Turkish territory on both banks, then turns towards the south and forms the border between Greece on the west bank and Turkey on the east bank to the Aegean Sea.  Turkey was given a small sector on the west bank opposite the city of Edirne.  The river enters the Aegean Sea near Enez, where it forms a delta.  The Tundzha is its chief tributary; the Arda is another one.  The lower course of the Maritsa/Evros forms part of the Bulgarian-Greek border and most of the Greek-Turkish border.  The upper Maritsa valley is a principal east-west route in Bulgaria.  The unnavigable river is used for power production and irrigation.\nVauxhall Bridge:Vauxhall Bridge is a Grade II* listed steel and granite deck arch bridge in central London.  It crosses the River Thames in a south–east north–west direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Pimlico on the north bank.

The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry.\nSouth Bank Sky Arts Award:South Bank Sky Arts Award: The South Bank Sky Arts Award (originally The South Bank Show Award) is an accolade recognizing British achievements in the arts.  The awards have been given annually since 1996.  They originated with the long-running British arts programme \"The South Bank Show\".  The last South Bank Show Awards ceremony to be broadcast by ITV was in January 2010.  After the network had announced that \"The South Bank Show\" would be cancelled at the end of the 2009 season, the award ceremony continued to be broadcast by Sky Arts and was eventually renamed the South Bank Sky Arts Award.  Sky Arts revived \"The South Bank Show\" itself in 2012.\nMiddlesbrough during World War II:Middlesbrough was the first major British town and industrial target to be bombed during the Second World War.  The Luftwaffe first attacked the town on 25 May 1940 when a lone bomber dropped 13 bombs between South Bank Road and the South Steel Plant.

These include habitats in the Gulf of California to Panama; tropical Pacific Ocean islands including Hawaii; the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia; and the Indian Ocean to the east coast of Africa.  The common name, \"rockmover wrasse\", comes from their behavior of upending small stones and reef fragments in search of prey.  This species is the only known member of its genus.\nPartula (gastropod):Partula is a genus of air-breathing tropical land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Partulidae.

He is one of the early Aryacakravarti kings about whom historical and epigraphical evidence is available.  He was noted by Ibn Battuta in his well-known travelogue as well as he has left behind a few inscriptions.  He oversaw the international trade of the Jaffna kingdom with Yemen via the kingdom's powerful trading ships.  Martanda Cinkaiariyan accompanied Battuta to the peak of \"Sivanoli Padam Malai\" along with Yogis and other Hindus and companions of the king who visited the sacred Shiva site annually.\nMinhlange:Minhlange (Burmese: မင်းလှငယ် , ] ; 1418–1425) was king of Ava for about three months in 1425.  Minhlange ascended to the throne in August 1425 after his father King Thihathu had been killed in an ambush by raiders from the Shan State of Hsipaw (Thibaw).  He was only about seven years old.  The ambush was arranged by Thihathu's powerful queen Shin Bo-Me who wanted to place her lover, Kale Kyetaungnyo, the Saopha of Kale, on the throne.  About three months later, Shin Bo-Me poisoned the young king in early November 1425 and made Kyetaungnyo king a few days later.\nCoenwulf of Mercia:Coenwulf (also spelled Cenwulf, Kenulf, or Kenwulph) was King of Mercia from December 796 until his death in 821.  He was a descendant of a sibling of King Penda, who had ruled Mercia in the middle of the 7th century.  He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died.  In the early years of Coenwulf's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa's control.  Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene.  When Pope Leo agreed to anathematize Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and had his hands cut off.  Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald.  Coenwulf's coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control.  Several campaigns of Coenwulf's against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.\nRamesuan (king of Ayutthaya):Somdet Phra Ramesuan (Thai: สมเด็จพระราเมศวร ) (1339–1395), son of king Ramathibodi I, reigned as the second and fifth king of the kingdom of Ayutthaya.  When King Ramathibodi ascended to the throne of Ayuthaya, he sent King Ramesuan to reign in Lavo.  Upon King Ramathibodi's death in 1369, King Ramesuan traveled to Ayutthaya to assume the throne, but held it for less than a year before being deposed by his uncle, King Borommaracha I, the ruler of Suphanburi.  Sources differ over the nature of their conflict; official chronicles state that the older Boromaracha ruled with the willing consent of his nephew, while Jeremias van Vliet's \"Short History of Thailand\" indicated that Boromaracha's ascension came only after a bloody conflict bordering on civil war.\nColoman, King of Hungary:Coloman the Learned, also the Book-Lover or the Bookish (Hungarian: \"Könyves Kálmán\" ; Croatian: \"Koloman\" ; Slovak: \"Koloman Učený\" ; 10703February 1116) was King of Hungary from 1095 and King of Croatia from 1097 until his death.  Because Coloman and his younger brother Álmos were underage when their father King Géza I of Hungary died, their uncle LadislausI ascended the throne in 1077.  Ladislaus prepared Colomanwho was \"half-blind and humpbacked\", according to late medieval Hungarian chroniclesfor a church career, and Coloman was eventually appointed bishop of Eger or Várad (Oradea, Romania) in the early 1090s.  The dying King Ladislaus preferred Álmos to Coloman when nominating his heir in early 1095.  Coloman fled from Hungary but returned around 19 July 1095 when his uncle died.  He was crowned in early 1096; the circumstances of his accession to the throne are unknown.  He granted the Hungarian Duchyone-third of the Kingdom of Hungaryto Álmos.\nParakrama Pandyan I:Parakrama Pandyan I was a Pandyan king of Tamilakkam, ruling from the Pandyan capital in Madurai.  He was besieged in a Pandyan war by his contemporary, rival and throne claimant Kulasekhara Pandyan in 1169, a vassal of the Chola Dynasty.  Parakrama Pandyan I sought assistance from the Ceylonese king Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa but was subsequently executed.  Kulasekhara Pandyan ascended to the Madurai throne but was eventually forced to seek refuge in Chola country in 1171.  Parakrama Pandyan I's son Vira Pandyan III ascended on the Pandyan throne before he was defeated by Chola forces.  In 1212 CE a succeeding namesake royal of the dynasty, Parakrama Pandyan II invaded Ceylon and became monarch at Polonnaruwa for three years with the title Parakrama Pandya of Polonnaruwa.\nLü Buwei:Lü Buwei (291–235 BC) was a politician of the Qin state in the Warring States period of ancient China.  Originally an influential merchant from the Wey (衛) state, Lü Buwei met and befriended King Zhuangxiang of Qin, who was then a minor prince serving as a hostage in the Zhao state.  Through bribes and machinations, Lü Buwei succeeded in helping King Zhuangxiang become the heir apparent to the Qin throne.  In 249 BC, after King Zhuangxiang ascended the throne following the death of his father, King Xiaowen, he appointed Lü Buwei as his chancellor (相國) and ennobled him as \"Marquis Wenxin\" (文信侯).  After King Zhuangxiang's death in 247 BC, Lü Buwei became the chancellor and regent to King Zhuangxiang's young son, Ying Zheng, who later became Qin Shi Huang (First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty).\nPolitics of Swaziland:Swaziland is an absolute monarchy with constitutional provisions and Swazi law and Custom.  The head of state is the king or \"Ngwenyama\" (lit.  \"Lion\"), currently King Mswati III, who ascended to the throne in 1986 after the death of his father King Sobhuza II in 1982 and a period of regency.  According to the constitution of Swaziland, the King and Ingwenyama is a symbol of unity and the eternity of the Swazi nation.  By tradition, the king reigns along with his mother or a ritual substitute, the \"Ndlovukati\" (lit.  \"She-Elephant\").  The former was viewed as the administrative head of state and the latter as a spiritual and national head of state, with real power counterbalancing that of the king, but during the long reign of Sobhuza II the role of the \"Ndlovukati\" became more symbolic.  The king appoints the prime minister from the legislature and also appoints a minority of legislators to both chambers of Libandla (parliament), with help from an advisory council.  The king is allowed by the constitution to appoint some members to parliament for special interests.  These special interests are citizens who might have been left out by the electorate during the course of elections or did not enter as candidates.  This is done to balance views in parliament.  Special interests could be people of gender, race, disability, business community, civic society, scholars, chiefs and so on.  The Senate consists of 30 members, of which some are appointed by the king on recommendation of the advisory council and others elected by the lower house.  The House of Assembly has 65 seats, 55 of which are occupied by elected representatives from the 55 constituencies around the country, 10 appointed by the king on recommendation of the advisory council and the attorney general is the ex-officio member.  Elections are held every five years.\nSen Soulintha:Sen Soulintha: Sen Soulintha, Saen Surintha or Sen Sourintha (1511–1582) was born Chane Tian and became King of Lan Xang reigning 1571-1575 and again 1580-1582.  Sen Soulintha was not of noble birth, rising from royal page to King Setthatirath’s Chief Minister.  During the succession disputes in the Kingdom of Lan Na between King Setthatirath and King Mekuti, Sen Soulintha served Setthatirath as a general and successfully took several cities of Lan Na including Chiang Saen for which he was given the honorific name \"Lusai\" meaning “victory.”  Sen Soulintha supported Setthatirath in leading the guerrilla campaigns during the Burmese invasions of King Bayinnaung.  When Setthatirath died near Attapeu under suspicious circumstances in 1572, Sen Soulintha led the armies of Lan Xang back to Vientiane.  A succession dispute erupted, which nearly led to civil war and provided a pretext for another Burmese invasion ordered by Bayinnaung and led by the Chief Minister Binnya Dala.  Sen Soulintha defeated the Burmese and Lan Na forces led by Binnya Dala, an event which led to the latter’s exile, only to face a more massive invasion led by Bayinnaug the following year.  Sen Soulintha again attempted to resort to guerilla tactics, but lacked popular support from his seizure of the throne.  He and his son Ong Lo (Nakhon Noi) were captured by Bayinnaung and exiled to Pegu.  The Burmese placed Setthathirath’s brother, and former \"Ouphahat\" or Viceroy, Prince Tha Heua on the throne.  According to the Luang Prabang chronicles it was this brother, who had led a rebellion in Luang Prabang and tried to seize the throne from Setthathirath on the death of their father Photisarath.  Prince Tha Heua took the regnal name Voravongsa and reigned under Burmese suzerainty from 1575-1579.  Voravongsa was never popular, and drowned with his family while attempting to flee Vientiane in the face of popular uprising.  In 1579, Bayinnaung dispatched a sizable army to restore order.  According to Lao histories Sen Soulintha was then installed as king a second time in 1580.  By that time Sen Soulintha was an old man and reigned only for two years before his son ascended the throne as Nakhon Noi and another succession dispute ensued.\n\nAnswer:"

Approximately 5,000 students enroll each year.\nUIUC College of Education:The School of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was founded in 1905.  It was later renamed the College of Education in 1918.  The college offers undergraduate, graduate, and online programs in areas including elementary education, early childhood education, special education, and Educational Organization and Leadership.  It began with six departments; three of them merged and formed the largest department in the college.  All departments offer masters and doctoral degrees.  However, only two departments offer undergraduate degree programs: Special Education and Curriculum & Instruction.  The college also offers 16 online programs.  Students seeking an undergraduate degree in the college must meet the minimum graduation requirement set forth by the university.  To obtain a certification, students must also meet the requirements of the Council on Teacher Education, a professional educational administration at the University of Illinois.

It is considered to be greater level of education than a high school diploma or GED.\nBachelor's degree:A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin \"baccalaureus\") or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin \"baccalaureatus\") is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years (depending on institution and academic discipline).  In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed.  In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD).\nBachelor of Independent Studies:A Bachelor of Independent Studies is an undergraduate academic degree.  Its program of studies is unique to each student, and the individual curricula are largely determined by each student.  It may focus in any field, and generally has two phases: a pre-thesis phase, in which the student takes courses or reading courses, and a thesis phase, in which the student completes a substantial thesis.  A similarly name Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies is also awarded by some universities.  The degree can be considered akin to a degree in general studies.\nBachelor of Medical Sciences:A Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours) (BMedSci, BMedSc, BMSc, BSci(Med) or Bachelor of Medical Sciences is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for completed courses that generally last for 2–4 years.

While the degree has a major focus on computers and technology, it differs from a Computer Science degree in that students are also expected to study management and information science, and there are reduced requirements for mathematics.  A degree in computer science can be expected to concentrate on the scientific aspects of computing, while a degree in information technology can be expected to concentrate on the business and communication applications of computing.  There is more emphasis on these two areas in the e-commerce, e-business and business information technology undergraduate courses.  Specific names for the degrees vary across countries, and even universities within countries.\nBachelor of Pharmacy:A Bachelor of Pharmacy (abbreviated B Pharm) is an undergraduate academic degree in the field of pharmacy.  The degree is the basic prerequisite for registration to practice as a pharmacist in many countries and its about understanding the properties and impacts of medicines and developing the skills required to counsel patients about their use.  In some countries, it has been superseded by the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) degrees.  In the United States, this degree was granted as the baccalaureate pharmacy degree only at Washington State University, where it has now been superseded by the PharmD degree.  The degree previously offered within the US—and still the required degree in Canada—is the Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy.\nMaster of Laws:The Master of Laws (M.L. or LL.M.; Latin \"Magister Legum \" or \"Legum Magister \") is a postgraduate academic degree, pursued by those either holding an undergraduate academic law degree, a professional law degree, or an undergraduate degree in a related subject.

It allows a fluid to flow preferentially in one direction, without moving parts.  The device is named after Nikola Tesla, who was awarded a patent in 1920 for its invention.  The patent application describes the invention as follows: The interior of the conduit is provided with enlargements, recesses, projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance to the passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the opposite [direction].  Tesla illustrates this with the drawing in Figure 1, showing one possible construction with a series of eleven flow-control segments, although any other number of such segments could be used as desired to increase or decrease the flow regulation effect.\nTrela nera:One thing that characterizes Euboea and especially Chalkida is the phenomenon of \"trela nera\".  (i.e. Crazy Waters).  This phenomenon is a rare phenomenon that occurs in the Strait of Euripus under the bridge opening, where the flow of ocean waters changes.  That is, when the water flowing one direction and then in the exact opposite direction.  This change happens approximately every 6 hours.This phenomenon reaches its climax under the old sliding bridge where the speed of the water takes the maximum speed of 9 miles per hour.  It is said that this speed of the water, a shark will struggle to swim in the opposite direction.  This phenomenon is as follows: the waters move in the one direction for 6 hours, then for 8 minutes waters are stable and then they flow in the opposite direction for other 6 hours, then other 8 minutes the water is stable, and so on.  It is this strange phenomenon that has given the city of Xalkida the nickname of \"Crazy waters\".\n\nAnswer:"

The dune was created by winds that brought sand up the Chaco River.  When the dune was large enough, it dammed the Chaco Wash and created a small and shallow lake near the Ancestral Puebloan great house, Penasco Blanco.  Archeological evidence suggests that the dune was breached around 900 CE.  Chacoans filled the breach with masonry sometime in the early 11th century, and built an accompanying reservoir lined with stones that was visible until 1920.  The dam stopped Chaco Wash from further deepening, which helped raise the water table in the canyon, aiding Chacoan farming.  The absence of a lacustrine plain behind the dam led geologist Stephen A. Hall to question this interpretation.\nIngram–Schipper Farm:Ingram–Schipper Farm is a historic farm complex located near Boonsboro, Washington County, Maryland, United States.

The countries maintained relatively cordial relations after that, and Japanese immigration to the United States was prominent until the 20th century, up until the 1930s, when Japanese actions during the Second Sino-Japanese War caused the United States to impose harsh sanctions against Japan, ultimately leading to the Japanese surprise attack against the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, opening the Pacific War theater of World War II.

Japan surrendered, and was subjected to seven years of military occupation by the United States, during which the American occupiers helped rebuild the country, shared American technology, and carried out widespread political and economic reforms so as to transform Japan into a democracy and a potential bulwark against Communism.

His army was pursued by the forces of Tipu Sultan, who made two attacks early in September on the Maratha camp, which proved to be indecisive.  On 15 September 1786, Tipu's army encamped approximately 5 miles from Savanur.  On 1 October 1786, Tipu's army divided into four columns and made a surprise attack on the Maratha position.  The Marathas, however, were informed by their spies about Tipu's surprise attack and had evacuated their position.  The Marathas moved to a height from which they attacked Tipu's forces with artillery.  Tipu ordered his troops not to fire back to deceive the Marathas into thinking that he did not possess long range guns.  He did this to lure the Marathas to make an offensive.  The strategy had proven to be effective, and the Marathas advanced to the Mysore position.  When the Marathas had come close enough, Tipu's army unleashed a strong barrage of heavy fire on them.  Tipu's heavy firing on the Marathas continued for approximately 7 hours.  The Marathas were forced to retreat and Tipu Sultan entered Savanur on 10 October 1786 with support from the inhabitants of the city.\n\nAnswer:"

It is also the name of their humorous rock band.  Radioshow has started at radio station Radiocentras in 1992.  Later it has moved to the radio station Ultra Vires.  In 1995 Radioshow debuted as a comedy puppet show on TV at LNK station.  From 1997 till 1999 Radioshow was running at BTV TV station.  In 2004 it briefly ran on Vilnius radio station Užupio radijas before being shut down, because of swearing on the air.  However the show was immediately picked up by the regional radio station Vox Maris.\nWSYY-FM:WSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week (from 4:55AM through 11:10PM ET) under the slogan, \"\"Radio With An Attitude\"\".  Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to \"When Radio Was\").  \"The Mountain 94.9\" carries local high school sports in season.  \"The Mountain 94.9\" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on \"The Mountain 94.9\" during Baseball season).  The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades).  Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located.  The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc.  WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9.  Prior to their \"The Mountain 94.9\" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as \"North Country 95\", airing a full-time Country Music format.  The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent.  Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location).  On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC.  WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show.  WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET).  In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk.  In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air).\nGeorge Eldredge:George Eldredge (September 10, 1898 – March 12, 1977) was an American character actor.

Considered the first of his prophetic books, it is also the first poem in which Blake used free septenaries, which he would go on to use in much of his later verse.  \"Tiriel\" was unpublished during Blake's lifetime and remained so until 1874, when it appeared in William Michael Rossetti's \"Poetical Works of William Blake\".  Although Blake did not engrave the poem, he did make twelve sepia drawings to accompany the rough and unfinished manuscript, although three of them are considered lost as they have not been traced since 1863.\nThe Ancient of Days:The Ancient of Days is a design by William Blake, originally published as the frontispiece to a 1794 work, \"Europe a Prophecy\".  It draws its name from one of God's titles in the Book of Daniel and shows Urizen crouching in a circular design with a cloud-like background.  His outstretched hand holds a compass over the darker void below.  Related imagery appears in Blake's \"Newton\", completed the next year.  As noted in Gilchrist's \"Life of William Blake\", the design of \"The Ancient of Days\" was \"a singular favourite with Blake and as one it was always a happiness to him to copy.\"  As such there are many versions of the work extant, including one completed for Frederick Tatham only weeks before Blake's death.\nAuguries of Innocence (poetry collection):Auguries of Innocence is a poetry collection by Patti Smith, published in 2005.  This collection of poetry includes exactly twenty-six recent poems penned by the active, contemporary poet.  Drawing on some of her many influences such as William Blake and Arthur Rimbaud, Smith's collection here demonstrates over and over again her knack for detail.  Obviously William Blake is a dominant influence on the poet herself, since it shares its title, Auguries of Innocence, with one of William Blake's poems.  Upon reviewing both collections it is clearly obvious that both collections share more commonalities than just similar titles.  One commonality between this collection and that by Blake's, in regard to the content, is that the poems collected here exhibit subtle nods to Blake.  For example, in one of her poems, \"The Long Road\", by the end of the very first verse the reader has already been exposed to such suggestive visuals as the speaker of the poem sleeping in chimneys and chewing on bulbs, as well as the speaker \"sweeping time\".  Such visuals of Smith's conjure up recollections in the seasoned and experienced reader's mind of Blake's \"The Chimney Sweeper\" and \"The Blossom\".  While the majority of the twenty-six collected poems have some type of stanza-like arrangement the poet also incorporates several free-verse style poems into the collection, such as Mummer Love, Eve of All Saints, Our Jargon Muffles The Drum, and Written By A Lake.\nFreiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft:The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (FSK, Voluntary Self Control of the Movie Industry) is a German motion picture rating system organization run by the \"Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft\" (SPIO, Head Organisation of the Movie Industry) based in Wiesbaden.\nBeautiful Illusions:Beautiful Illusions (镜中人) is a Singaporean TV series which aired in 2005.

It was formed in the Spring of 1893 by Victor Emerson, manager of the New Jersey Phonograph Company.  Simon S. Ott and George E. Tewkesbury, heads of the Kansas Phonograph Company and inventors of an automatic phonograph joined later.  It was based in Newark, New Jersey.  After the collapse of the North American Phonograph Company in August 1894, the United States Phonograph Company became one of the industry's largest suppliers of records, competing mostly with the Columbia Phonograph Company who had joined with the American Graphophone Company to manufacture graphophones (at this point nearly identical to phonographs), blank wax cylinders, and original and duplicate records.  The USPC manufactured duplicates as well, which allowed their recording program to reach the scale of competing with Columbia's.  Their central location and proximity to New York allowed them to record the most popular artists of the 1890s, including George J. Gaskin, Dan W. Quinn, Len Spencer, Russell Hunting and Issler's Orchestra.  Emerson left the company to lead Columbia's recording department around the summer of 1896.  In 1897 the USPC worked with Edison's National Phonograph Company to retrofit phonographs with spring motors invented by Frank Capps.  The convenience and cost savings of spring-motor phonographs like these helped shift the phonograph from a public entertainment (in parlors or exhibitions) to a consumer good.  In October 1899 the company was prohibited by court order from manufacturing duplicate records, and they began supplying original records for the National Phonograph Company[7][6]<nowiki>[5]</nowiki>.  The later U.S. Phonograph Company of Cleveland Ohio is unrelated.\nNew Jersey State Opera:The New Jersey State Opera is an opera company based in Newark, New Jersey.

The process used a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of oil shale into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue.  The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moves from the bottom upward to the top, countercurrent to the descending hot gases, by a mechanism known as a rock pump.  The process technology was invented by the American oil company Unocal Corporation in late 1940s and was developed through several decades.  The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort.\nHaskelite:Haskell invented a process for making glue from blood-albumin.  The process used slaughterhouse blood from the Chicago stock yards.  The inexpensive waterproof adhesive was called \"black albumin glue.\"  It was used to bond wood pieces.  One product Haskell made from this was a lightweight waterproof plywood, first known as Ser-O-Ply.  He applied this glue to wood veneers and manufactured plywood for various applications.  Some of these applications were boats, airplanes, tanks, trucks, automobiles and rail cars.  They were from 1/8th inch thick to just over an inch thick, and had various layers of ply veneers.  Typical moldable plywood panels were about five feet wide by twenty feet long and 3/16th of an inch thick.  The plywood sheets made this way were eventually given the brand trade name of \"haskelite.\"  It is named after Henry L. Haskell, inventor of the glue bonding the plywood.\nNew Jersey v. Delaware:New Jersey v. Delaware, 552 U.S. 597 (2008), is a United States Supreme Court case in which New Jersey sued Delaware, invoking the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under  /1251 § 1251  (a), following Delaware's denial of oil company BP's petition to build a liquefied natural gas pipeline and loading facility on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River.  Delaware denied BP's petition because it violated Delaware's Coastal Zone Act.  BP then sought New Jersey's approval of the project.  Delaware objected because the construction would require dredging of underwater land within Delaware's borders, which extend to the low-tide mark of the New Jersey shore.  BP's proposal had not yet passed New Jersey's approval process when New Jersey and BP filed suit against Delaware.\nE-COM:E-COM, short for Electronic Computer Originated Mail, was a hybrid mail process used from 1982 to 1985 by the U.S. Postal Service to print electronically originated mail, and deliver it in envelopes to customers within two days of transmission.  The E-COM service allowed customers to transmit messages of up to two pages from their own computers, via telecommunication lines, to one or more of 25 serving post offices (SPOs) located in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC.  After an electronic message was received as a SPO, it was processed and sorted by ZIP Code, then printed on letter-size bond paper, folded, and sealed in an envelope printed with a blue E-COM logo.  In order to be eligible for the service, customers were required to send a minimum of 200 messages per transmission.\nDeep inelastic scattering:Deep inelastic scattering: Deep inelastic scattering is the name given to a process used to probe the insides of hadrons (particularly the baryons, such as protons and neutrons), using electrons, muons and neutrinos.  It provided the first convincing evidence of the reality of quarks, which up until that point had been considered by many to be a purely mathematical phenomenon.  It is a relatively new process, first attempted in the 1960s and 1970s.  It is an extension of Rutherford scattering to much higher energies of the scattering particle and thus to much finer resolution of the components of the nuclei.\nInduction programme:An induction programme is the process used within many businesses to welcome new employees to the company and prepare them for their new role.  Its helps in the effective integration of the employee into the organisation.\nSour mash:Sour mash is a process used in the distilling industry that uses material from an older batch of mash to start the fermentation of a new batch, analogous to the making sourdough bread with a starter.  The term \"sour mash\" can also be used as the name of the type of mash used in that process, and a whiskey made using this process can be referred to as a \"sour mash whiskey\".  Sour mash does not refer to the flavor of the whiskey, as is sometimes thought.\nJoint application design:Joint application design (JAD) is a process used in the life cycle area of the dynamic systems development method (DSDM) to collect business requirements while developing new information systems for a company.  \"The JAD process also includes approaches for enhancing user participation, expediting development, and improving the quality of specifications.\"  It consists of a workshop where \"knowledge workers and IT specialists meet, sometimes for several days, to define and review the business requirements for the system.\"  The attendees include high level management officials who will ensure the product provides the needed reports and information at the end.  This acts as \"a management process which allows Corporate Information Services (IS) departments to work more effectively with users in a shorter time frame\".\n\nAnswer:"
