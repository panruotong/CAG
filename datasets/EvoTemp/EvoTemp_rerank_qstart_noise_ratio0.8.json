Serious scholarly investigation of diet, ingredients, and rituals of consumption progressed rapidly over the last decades of the twentieth century. The founders of the influential Annales (1886–1944) school of historical analysis, Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), encouraged academicians to use archival documents, such as wills, household accounts, notarial records, and institutional inventories to study the diet and food habits of the past. Historians took up the challenge. By the 1960s and 1970s, research on European diet and food habits from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century focused on alimentation: food and drink production (planting and harvesting), distribution, and consumption. Quantitative studies dealt with a variety of specific historical questions from determining caloric intake to calculating per capita meat consumption. Despite a variety of criticisms about the incomplete or imprecise nature of the archival sources, notable Annalistes, such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Fernand Braudel, went on to establish the study of food and diet as a legitimate means to better understand the structures of everyday life in European history. date:2016/10/09\nThe staple foods of ancient feudal Europe varied depending on the region, but some common foods included grains such as wheat, barley, and rye; vegetables like cabbage, turnips, and onions; and legumes such as peas and beans. Meat, especially from domesticated animals like pigs, sheep, and cattle, was also an important part of the diet for those who could afford it. Additionally, dairy products like cheese and butter were commonly consumed. The diet of the common people in feudal Europe was often limited and basic, with a heavy reliance on locally available produce. date:None\n10 Indigenous Foods Thought to Be European:\nMuch confusion surrounds indigenous foods. \"Before 1492,tomatoes,potatoes,wild rice,salmon,pumpkins,peanuts,bison,chocolate,vanilla,blueberries and corn,among other foods,were unknown in Europe,Africa and Asia.

In California, gas taxes are about fifty percent higher than the national average, according to the American Petroleum Institute.\n date:2023/10/12\nWhat State Has the Highest Gas Prices?

The awards are named after Antoinette Perry, an American actress who died in 1946. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the Tony Award Productions, a joint venture of The Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing, to \"honor the best performances and stage productions of the previous year.\"[1]\nOriginally called the \"Tony Award for Actress, Supporting or Featured (Dramatic),\" Patricia Neal first won the award at the inception of the ceremony for her portrayal of Regina Hubbard in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest.

However,a new case was reported this week in which state? date:2023/05/12\nDocs:A child in Maine has tested positive for measles, state health officials said. While the virus was declared eliminated more than two decades ago, health officials say vaccination rates in the US have dropped in recent years, sparking new outbreaks.\n date:2023/05/07\nDuring January 1–October 1, 2019, a total of 1,249 measles cases and 22 measles outbreaks were reported in the United States. This represents the most U.S. cases reported in a single year since 1992 (1), and the second highest number of reported outbreaks annually since measles was declared eliminated* in the United States in 2000 (2). Measles is an acute febrile rash illness with an attack rate of approximately 90% in susceptible household contacts (3). Domestic outbreaks can occur when travelers contract measles outside the United States and subsequently transmit infection to unvaccinated persons they expose in the United States. Among the 1,249 measles cases reported in 2019, 1,163 (93%) were associated with the 22 outbreaks, 1,107 (89%) were in patients who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 119 (10%) measles patients were hospitalized. Closely related outbreaks in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS; excluding NYC), with ongoing transmission for nearly 1 year in large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, accounted for 934 (75%) cases during 2019 and threatened the elimination status of measles in the United States. Robust responses in NYC and NYS were effective in controlling transmission before the 1-year mark; however, continued vigilance for additional cases within these communities is essential to determine whether elimination has been sustained. Collaboration between public health authorities and undervaccinated communities is important for preventing outbreaks and limiting transmission. The combination of maintenance of high national vaccination coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and rapid implementation of measles control measures remains the cornerstone for preventing widespread measles transmission (4). date:2019/10/04\nMeasles Elimination\nThe United States has maintained measles elimination status for almost 20 years.\nWhile we expect importations of measles cases into the United States to continue, the risk for measles for the majority of the population would still remain low. That is because most people in the United States are vaccinated against measles. date:2020/11/05\nIt comes at a time when measles cases are rising at the fastest rate in several decades. In 2000, measles was declared\nTrusted Source\n as being eliminated from the US. However, in 2019, nearly 1,300 cases were reported across 31 states — all of which occurred from traveling abroad.\nSo far, 16 measles cases have been reported in the US this year, with 14 of these linked to international visits. The CDC estimates that twice as many Americans are planning on international travel this year compared to last.\n date:2022/06/28\nMeasles resurgence in the United States:Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 by the World Health Organization due to the success of vaccination efforts.[1] However,it continues to be reintroduced by international travelers,[1] and in recent years,anti-vaccination sentiment has allowed for the reemergence of measles outbreaks.[2][3]\nIn 2018,371 cases of measles were confirmed in the United States. From January to August 2019,1215 cases across 30 states had been confirmed as measles by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[4] This is the largest number of cases in one calendar year since the disease was declared eliminated.[5] In 2019,a state of emergency was declared in New York City[6] and Washington[7] in response to the extremely contagious disease. There is concern that the World Health Organization (WHO) may rescind the U.S.'s measles elimination status. date:2023/05/08\n\nAnswer:"

Laws passed before July 20, 2013, are grandfathered in, and a number of local governments in the Chicago area have laws that either prohibit or regulate the possession of firearms that they define as assault weapons.[80] These include the city of Chicago[81] and Cook County.[82] On December 7, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to grant a writ of certiorari to take up a challenge brought against a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which had upheld a local law banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois.[83] In refusing to hear the case, the Supreme Court allowed the ruling to stand and the ban to remain in place.\nIndiana[edit]\nIn March 1989 the Northwest Indiana cities of Gary and East Chicago city councils passed ordinances prohibiting both sale and possession of assault weapons. Gary City Councilman Vernon G. Smith (D-4th) sponsored the ordinance making it a crime to possess or sell assault-type weapons.[84] Both of these ordinances were invalidated under statewide pre-emption legislation enacted by the Indiana General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Mitch Daniels in 2011.\nIn July 2023, the Indianapolis City-County Council passed an assault weapons ban trigger law, which can only go into effect once the Indiana state preemption law is repealed or invalidated.\nMassachusetts[edit]\nBoston has a law prohibiting the possession or transfer of assault weapons without a license from the Boston Police Commissioner.[ date:2023/07/24\nIllinois Supreme Court upholds state’s assault-style weapons ban\nThe Illinois Supreme Court on Friday upheld the state’s assault-style weapons ban in a 4-3 ruling after months of legal challenges sought to dismantle the law.\nState lawmakers in January passed, and Democratic Gov.

The upper stage has a single TQ-12 main engine and a lower-thrust vernier engine. date:2023/07/12\nWhy the next generation of rockets will be powered by methane\nWhile the next generation of rockets and spacecraft won’t look wildly different on the surface, the biggest change is that we’ll get them back, give them a (metaphorical) hose down, and put them right back on the pad for their next mission.\nAccording to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, reusing rockets could bring launch costs down to $90m versus billions spent on conventional rocket launches. So it’s not surprising that the two companies pushing the boundaries of reusability of rockets are also both developing methane rocket engines – SpaceX’s Raptor and Blue Origin’s BE-4.\nWhen RP-1 fuel burns, it generates a lot of carbon, coating engine components with coke and limiting the potential for re-use. Cleaner burning methane engines are expected to improve that turnaround time and reduce launch costs even further.\nBut methane rockets’ future goes beyond just an expected improvement in reusability. In 2013 when the Raptor was announced, it was as a “highly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed for the exploration and colonisation of Mars.” date:2019/07/03\nThe wild physics of Elon Musk's methane-guzzling super-rocket\nThe other is the use of methane. No methane-powered rocket has ever made it to orbit, with Starhopper’s test hop the other day being the first time a methane-powered rocket engine had actually taken flight. Methane prevents a build-up of deposits in the engine compared to other fuels like kerosene, a process known as coking, while its higher performance allows for lower costs. date:2019/07/31\nIs Methane a Future Rocket Fuel?\nLooking through the timeline, it looks like serious research were not conducted on Methane that contributed to workable potential propellant. At the time when USA returned from the Moon, production of Methane was a tough process, so those responsibilities were considered specialist jobs; while now, due to heavy production and application it is considered a general job. NASA carried small experiments since 1972 but they were unable to conduct research on large-scale targeting commercial flights.\nMethane was only considered potential future fuel until SpaceX (Raptor engine, 2.2 mega-newton) and Blue Origin (BE-4 engine, 2.4 mega-newton) planned for commercial flight last decade. date:2022/10/21\nAs a result, all worldwide major players in space transportation are currently developing methane rocket engines. However, no actual flying methane rocket engines exist, except from first demonstrators and first successful flight demonstrations with flight times of a few minutes. date:2022/11/09\n\nAnswer:"

It will include $900 million in Hawaiian Airlines debt.\n“This is a fantastic deal that bring two airlines that have amazing loyalties in our regions together,” said Minicucci in a news conference, adding that the merger will give customers in both states expanded domestic and international choices. date:2023/12/03\nThe Business Case for Alaska Airlines-American Airlines Merger\nCurrently American Airlines has hubs at New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Philadelphia, Washington-National, Charlotte, Miami, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Forth Worth, Phoenix-Sky Harbor, and Los Angeles.\nCurrently Alaska Airlines has Hubs at Los Angeles, Portland, San Fransisco, Seattle, and Anchorage, with focus at Dallas-Love Field.\nThe merger between Alaska Airlines and American Airlines makes the most sense in the next few years for several key reasons; First, it gives American Airlines the opportunity to have a large presence on the West Coast of the United States and to supplement their strong east coast network of hub. Compete out of San Fransisco with United as they currently do at O'Hare, Open up West Coast Hub Gateway at Portland Airport to complement Delta's West Coast hub in Seattle and United's West Coast Hub in San Fransisco.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that, based on its analysis, Tesla’s FSD feature “led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.” And it warned FSD could violate traffic laws at some intersections “before some drivers may intervene.” date:2023/02/16\nTesla to recall nearly 55,000 Model X vehicles, auto regulator says\nOct 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto regulator on Tuesday said Tesla (TSLA.O) will recall 54,676 Model X vehicles manufactured between 2021-2023, as the vehicle controller is likely to fail to detect low brake fluid and not display a warning light.\nTesla has released an over-the-air (OTA) software update, free of charge, to fix the issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.\nThe electric vehicle maker is not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths that may be related to this condition as of Oct. 10, the regulator added. date:2023/10/18\nTesla recalls 362,000 U.S. vehicles over Full Self-Driving software\nWASHINGTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will recall more than 362,000 U.S. vehicles to update its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software after U.S. regulators said on Thursday the driver assistance system did not adequately adhere to traffic safety laws and could cause crashes.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the Tesla software allows a vehicle to \"exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner increases the risk of a crash.\" date:2023/02/17\nKey Takeaways.

Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes Ohio, where voters Tuesday enshrined abortion access in the state constitution. date:2023/11/08\nalifornia, Michigan, Vermont, Kentucky and Montana — have posed the future of abortion to their constituents in the upcoming midterm election. \nCalifornia, Michigan and Vermont have proposed constitutional amendments that would offer an affirmative right to abortion and reproductive freedom. \nBy contrast, Kentucky’s measure, if approved, would assert that there is no constitutional right to abortion in the Bluegrass State. Montana’s measure asks voters to state that infants “born alive at any state of development” require doctors attempt lifesaving medical care — a simple statement that all but ensures a ban on most forms of surgical abortion.\nBut it all starts with Kansas, the Republican-leaning state that shocked the nation earlier this year when voters overwhelmingly beat back a referendum aimed at opening the door to a statewide abortion ban. date:2022/10/18\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal Constitutional standard that had protected the right to abortion. Absent any federal standard addressing a right to abortion, states may set their own policies banning or protecting abortion. Explicit protections or restrictions in state Constitutions will limit the authority of state legislators to pass new abortion laws. Presently, five states have Constitutional amendments restricting state courts from interpreting a right to abortion or requiring state funding of abortion. Ten states have state supreme court rulings interpreting a right to abortion in their state Constitutions, but these rulings can be overturned. Most recently, in June 2022, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned its previous decision interpreting the right to abortion in its state Constitution. However, explicit state Constitutional amendments recognizing or restricting abortion remove the role of the state courts in interpreting the state Constitution to evaluate whether a right to abortion is recognized in that state. date:2022/11/14\nOhio voters approve amendment to establish right to abortion in state constitution, CBS News projects\nOhio voters have approved a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to establish a right to abortion, CBS News projects, delivering a crucial victory for abortion rights and adding momentum behind efforts to protect abortion access through citizen-led initiatives in the wake of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade. date:2023/11/08\nAbortion rights across the US: we track where laws stand in every state\nThe US supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade may have abolished the national right to abortion, but the state-by-state battle for abortion rights is far from over.\nSince Roe was overturned in 2022, 14 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, while two states – Georgia and South Carolina – have banned abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Other states have enacted laws or held ballot referendums to protect abortion rights. date:2023/11/10\n\nAnswer:"

On Friday, Gov. Greg Abbott signed his state’s bill, making Texas the largest state to ban transition care for minors. Another ban, in Missouri, was signed into law on Wednesday. date:2023/06/07\nNineteen of the 50 US states have enacted bans or restrictions on transgender care with many penalising doctors who provide puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for children—including 10 years in prison in Idaho, fines up to $25 000, and loss of medical license.1\nIn 10 states the restrictions are already in effect. In the other states the restrictions will go into effect on 1 July, in October, or in January 2024.\nMost states that ban or restrict transgender care for children are in the southern and central US. Florida, Nebraska, and Texas are among the most recent to pass such laws. date:2023/05/22\nBills Restricting Care for Trans Teens Skyrocket\nSixteen states have placed broad new restrictions on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender minors this year, with 16 others having introduced similar bills, in a record-breaking year.\nThese bills, which have been introduced mostly in Republican-controlled states, limit one or both of the main forms of gender-affirming care: medications that can delay the onset of puberty or hormones, and surgeries that aid in gender-transition. date:2023/05/23\nWHERE BANS STAND NATIONALLY\nAt least 22 states have enacted laws banning or restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most of the bans are being challenged in court.\nThe most recent state to enact a ban was North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of a measure banning medical professionals from providing hormone therapy, puberty-blocking drugs and surgical gender-transition procedures to anyone under 18, with limited exceptions. date:2023/08/22\nMinnesota to join at least 4 other states in protecting transgender care this year\nThis year, at least 12 states have passed legislation to limit or ban gender-affirming health care for young people, adding to several already on the books.

The court ruled that race-conscious admissions violate the equal-protection clause under the US constitution.\nEnvisioned as a tool to help remedy historical discrimination and create more diverse student bodies, affirmative action policies have permitted hundreds of colleges and universities to factor in students’ racial backgrounds during the admissions process. That consideration is supplementary, and taken in tandem with other factors such as applicants’ test scores, grades and extracurricular activities. date:2023/06/29\nThe History of Affirmative Action in the United States\nAffirmative action, as it exists today, began in the early 1960s to help alleviate racial discrimination when it came to hiring. President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925 into law in 1961. For employers, it required them to “not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin” and “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.” date:2022/12/22\nAffirmative action was developed in the 1960s to address racial inequality and racial exclusion in American society. Colleges and universities wanted to be seen as forward-thinking on issues of race.\nThen, in the late 1970s, affirmative action went to the United States Supreme Court. There, the only justification accepted, by Justice Powell, was the compelling state interest in a diverse student body in which everyone benefits from a range of perspectives in the classroom.\nColleges have fully taken on this justification — to the point that, today, they rarely mention the issue of inequality, or even of a diverse leadership, perhaps because they’re worried about getting sued. But this justification leads to what I call in my book a “diversity bargain,” in that many white students see the purpose of affirmative action as to benefit them, through a diverse learning environment. This justification, which ignored equity, leads to some unexpected, troubling expectations on the part of white students. date:2018/07/11\nDoes Affirmative Action Still Exist in College Admissions?\nA few decades ago, affirmative action became a reality in the college admissions process, an initiative that was intended to bridge the racial gap and bring blacks and, soon after, Latinos into the fold of the elite universities of America.  The basis of this rationale was to give these underrepresented minorities the same educational opportunities as whites and, in turn, provide them with the same employment opportunities after college. date:None\nFor decades, affirmative action programs have been used as one way to bring racial equity to college admissions. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases involving affirmative action, and is widely expected to say the practice is unconstitutional. The decision could come in early 2023. date:2022/09/09\n\nAnswer:"

She championed the expansion of NATO, pushed for the alliance to intervene in the Balkans to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing, sought to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, and championed human rights and democracy across the globe. date:2023/03/23\nMadeleine Jana Korbel Albright[1] (born Marie Jana Körbelová, later Korbelová; May 15, 1937 – March 23, 2022)[2][3] was an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the 64th United States secretary of state from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, Albright was the first woman to hold that post.[4]\nBorn in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Albright immigrated to the United States after the 1948 communist coup d'état when she was eleven years old. Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957.[5][6] Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring.[7] She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie from 1976 to 1978, before serving as a staff member on the National Security Council under Zbigniew Brzezinski. She served in that position until 1981 when President Jimmy Carter left office.[8]\nAfter leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of Georgetown University in 1982 and advised Democratic candidates regarding foreign policy. Following the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble President Bill Clinton's National Security Council. She was appointed United States ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997, a position she held until her elevation as secretary of state. Secretary Albright served in that capacity until President Clinton left office in 2001. date:2023/03/23\nMadeleine Albright, the first woman to become U.S. secretary of state, has died\nMadeleine Albright, the first woman to be U.S. secretary of state, has died, according to a statement from her family.\nAlbright was 84, and the cause of death was cancer, her family said.\n\"She was surrounded by family and friends. We have lost a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend,\" the statement said.\nShe served as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 during the Clinton administration.\n\"Hillary and I are profoundly saddened by the passing of Madeleine Albright. She was one of the finest secretaries of state, an outstanding UN ambassador, a brilliant professor, and an extraordinary human being,\" former President Bill Clinton said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \"Few leaders have been so perfectly suited for the times in which they served.\" date:2023/03/23\n\nAnswer:"

Trump over President Biden on the economy, foreign policy and immigration, as Mr. Biden’s multiracial base shows signs of fraying.\nVoters preferred Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden on immigration by 12 points, on national security by 12 points and on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 11 points. And though a 58 percent majority supported more economic and military aid to Ukraine — which aligns with Mr. Biden’s policy — that did not seem to benefit the president on broader questions of fitness to handle foreign affairs.\nMr. Biden’s strongest issue was abortion, where voters trusted him over Mr. Trump by nine percentage points. Mr. Biden also maintained the trust of voters by an even slimmer margin of three points over Mr. Trump on the more amorphous handling of “democracy.” date:2023/11/05\nVoters’ grim economic outlook helps boost Trump in new battleground poll\nA deeply pessimistic view of the U.S. economy among registered voters was a driving force behind new polling that shows support for former president Donald Trump outpacing President Joe Biden in five out of six key presidential swing states, one year ahead of the 2024 election.\nA survey released Sunday by The New York Times and Siena College found that if the election were held today, Trump would lead Biden in hypothetical matchups in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. The margins were between 4 and 10 percentage points, with a survey sampling error of between 4.4 and 4.8 points per state. date:2023/11/06\nAmid Campaign Turmoil, Biden Holds Wide Leads on Coronavirus, Unifying the Country\nMost Trump, Biden supporters say their differences go beyond policies to ‘core American values and goals’ date:2020/10/09\nVoters Prefer Biden Over Trump on Almost All Major Issues, Poll Shows\nJoe Biden leads President Trump, 50 percent to 41 percent, a New York Times/Siena College poll shows, with voters favoring him by wide margins on the coronavirus and law and order. date:2020/10/20\nHow enhanced US-China relations can aid both economiesScroll back up to restore default view.\nIf you’re an incumbent president running for reelection, you have to convince voters they’re better off than they were four years earlier.\nThis is where Joe Biden is running into trouble.\nBiden’s approval rating is stuck around 40%, and Americans rate his handling of the economy even worse. In a recent New York Times poll, swing state voters said they trusted former President Donald Trump over Biden on economic issues by 59% to 37%, the biggest gap of any issue. Voter mistrust of Biden on the economy, in fact, may be the only thing keeping Trump competitive, given the 91 criminal charges he faces and general disgust with Trump beyond his base in the Republican Party.\nThe Yahoo Finance Bidenomics Report Card rates the Biden economy a B, based on six metrics we’ve been tracking since Biden took office in 2021. Using data provided by Moody’s Analytics, we compare Biden with seven prior presidents and base his grade on performance relative to his predecessors. That allows us to compare the Trump and Biden economies directly, at the same point in each presidency. And it’s clear why many voters feel they were better off under Trump. date:2023/11/21\n\nAnswer:"

Law enforcement officials say organised gangs seek to conceal their shipments to Australian and European markets by bringing them into Sir Lanka, before switching the cargo into Sri Lankan containers and sending them onwards. Colombo’s high volumes of traffic and lack of effective security checks on cargo make it an attractive trans-shipment point.\nAccording to government officials, a spike in large-scale cocaine seizures (a drug previously uncommon in Sri Lanka) is a clear indication that the country is emerging as a key transit point for drug-smugglers. Counter-narcotics operations had traditionally focused their efforts on heroin and synthetic drugs. In December 2016, 928 kilograms of cocaine — the largest ever cocaine haul in South Asia — was discovered aboard a Colombian ship bound for India, one of several high value cocaine seizures in recent years.

They were to become the Founder Members of the Organization.\nThese countries were later joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962), Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973), Gabon (1975), Angola (2007), Equatorial Guinea (2017) and Congo (2018).\nEcuador suspended its membership in December 1992, rejoined OPEC in October 2007, but decided to withdraw its membership of OPEC effective 1 January 2020. Indonesia suspended its membership in January 2009, reactivated it again in January 2016, but decided to suspend its membership once more at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 30 November 2016. Gabon terminated its membership in January 1995. However, it rejoined the Organization in July 2016. Qatar terminated its membership on 1 January 2019.\nThis means that, currently, the Organization has a total of 13 Member Countries. date:None\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, /ˈoʊpɛk/ OH-pek) is an organization enabling the co-operation of leading oil-producing countries in order to collectively influence the global oil market and maximize profit. It was founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela). The 13 member countries account for an estimated 30 percent of global oil production.[2]\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the \"Seven Sisters\").[3] In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC.[4]\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources. OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil-market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel[5] (a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.[6]\nCurrent OPEC members are Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Angola, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Qatar are former OPEC members.[7] A larger group called OPEC+, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude-oil market.[8] Canada, Egypt, Norway and Oman are observer states. date:2023/12/25\nOPEC is an acronym for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It is a permanent, intergovernmental organization, created at the Baghdad Conference in September 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.

                "value": "Question:By how many votes did Felix Tshisekedi win the presidential election in the Republic of Congo? date:2024/01/01\nDocs:President Félix Tshisekedi has been declared the winner of Democratic Republic of Congo's election, which has been condemned as a \"sham\" by several opposition candidates demanding a rerun.\nThe president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said.\nThe 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems. date:2023/12/31\nViolence has always accompanied the change of leadership in the country.\nBut the row over the the results has dented hopes the election could bring the first orderly transfer of power since DR Congo's independence from Belgium in 1960.\nWhat about the 30 December poll?\nThe electoral commission earlier announced that Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote, compared with 34.7% for Mr Fayulu.\nRuling coalition candidate Emmanuel Shadary took 23.8%.\nHowever, Mr Fayulu had argued that Mr Tshisekedi had struck a deal with Mr Kabila, who has been in office for 18 years. date:2019/01/20\nFelix Tshisekedi has been named as the provisional winner of presidential elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a historic victory for an opposition leader.\nBut questions have been raised about the accuracy of the results amid accusations that Mr Tshisekedi is planning a power-sharing deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila.\nThe electoral commission said Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote on 30 December, compared to 34.7% for Martin Fayulu, another opposition figure. Ruling coalition candidate Emmanuel Shadary took 23.8%.\nThose raising doubts about the results include the country's influential Catholic Church, international experts based in the US, and the French and German governments. date:2019/01/16\nEarly this morning, the National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) finally announced official but provisional results from the Democratic Republic of Congo’s presidential elections held on 30 December 2018. Against all available independent evidence, CENI announced Felix Tshisekedi of the opposition Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) as the winner with 38.5%. Martin Fayulu, of the Lamuka opposition alliance, was said to have obtained 34.7% of the votes. The regime’s candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, garnered 23.8%. The participation rate was 47.6%.\nWhile rumors of a possible Tshisekedi victory had been swirling around the capital Kinshasa over the last few days – fed in part by alleged negotiations between his camp and the regime as well as the candidate’s recent benevolent declarations towards the outgoing President Joseph Kabila – the results are nonetheless highly implausible. Broadly reliable polling data by Congo’s BERCI and France’s IPSOS for the Congo Research Group (CRG) in December and actual voting count data by some 40,000 observers from the Catholic Episcopal Commission (CENCO) point instead to a solid and statistically robust victory by Fayulu.\nAs a matter of fact, and as explained in detail below, CRG’s data suggests that the probability Tshisekedi could have scored 38% in a free election is less than 0.0000. There is a 95% chance his real numbers would be somewhere between 21.3% and 25%. date:2019/01/10\nFélix Tshisekedi (UDPS) won with 38.6% of the vote, defeating another opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, and Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, backed by the ruling party PPRD. date:2020/06/30\n\nAnswer:"

The wind-driven fires prompted evacuations, caused widespread damage, killing at least 100 people and leaving four persons missing in the town of Lahaina on Maui's northwest coast. The proliferation of the wildfires was attributed to dry, gusty conditions created by a strong high-pressure area north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora to the south. date:2024/02/06\nThe 2020 California wildfire season, part of the 2020 Western United States wildfire season, was a record-setting year of wildfires in California. By the end of the year, 9,917 fires[1] had burned 4,397,809 acres (1,779,730 ha),[2][3][3] more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history (according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection),[5][6] though roughly equivalent to the pre-1800 levels which averaged around 4.4 million acres yearly and up to 12 million in peak years.[7] California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\", burning over 1 million acres across seven counties, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures[1] and cost over $12.079 billion (2020 USD) in damages, including over $10 billion in property damage and $2.079 billion in fire suppression costs.[4][2] The intensity of the fire season has been attributed to a combination of more than a century of poor forest management[8][9] and higher temperatures resulting from climate change. date:2021/09/23\nit is the second largest wildfire in Colorado state history by size. 2012, 18,247 acres (7,384 ha), Waldo Canyon Fire, Colorado, Rampart Range and West Colorado  date:2023/10/24\nStarting in the Bay Area, the Bay Area fire was one of the largest wildfire in US history and tore through parts of California, Oregon and Washington state. date:2020/09/14\n\nAnswer:"
