Meat, especially from domesticated animals like pigs, sheep, and cattle, was also an important part of the diet for those who could afford it. Additionally, dairy products like cheese and butter were commonly consumed. The diet of the common people in feudal Europe was often limited and basic, with a heavy reliance on locally available produce. date:None\nAn analysis of fossilized dental plaque has revealed that seaweed and aquatic plants were once a staple food for ancient Europeans,challenging previous assumptions about their diets. This research,published in the journal Nature Communications,shows that the consumption of nutrient-rich plants and algae was common in ancient Europe but difficult to detect in the archaeological record. Prior research suggested that the advent of farming led ancient humans to largely stop eating seaweed. A team of archaeologists examined the teeth of 74 early humans from 28 archaeological sites across Europe,dating back more than 8,000 years. Chemical markers in dental calculus revealed that 26 samples contained evidence of seaweed or aquatic plant consumption. The study demonstrates that ancient people consumed red,green,and brown seaweed,as well as various freshwater aquatic plants. This suggests that the nutritional benefits of seaweed were well understood,and people maintained their dietary link with the sea. Seaweed was found in various regions,including coastal and inland areas,emphasizing its widespread consumption in ancient Europe. date:2023/10/19\nCNN — Virtually absent from most present-day Western diets, seaweed and aquatic plants were once a staple food for ancient Europeans, an analysis of molecules preserved in fossilized dental plaque has found. date:2023/10/17\n10 Indigenous Foods Thought to Be European:\nMuch confusion surrounds indigenous foods. \"Before 1492,tomatoes,potatoes,wild rice,salmon,pumpkins,peanuts,bison,chocolate,vanilla,blueberries and corn,among other foods,were unknown in Europe,Africa and Asia.

One is that polls cannot be trusted. The other is that predictions of the demise of Peronism, the populist movement that has dominated politics in the country for seven decades, always prove premature. In the first round of Argentina’s presidential election on October 22nd, both truths were borne out.\nMost polls had put Javier Milei, a libertarian outsider, as the front-runner. Yet Mr Milei received 30% of votes. By contrast Sergio Massa (pictured), the Peronist candidate who is Argentina’s economy minister, won almost 37% of votes. The two candidates will now compete in a run-off on November 19th. Patricia Bullrich of Together for Change, a centre-right coalition, got 24% of votes and is out of the race.

Some California private colleges, meanwhile, are increasing their outreach efforts to attract more students and send a signal that the end of race-based admissions doesn’t change their belief in the importance of diversity.\nThe court’s 6-3 ruling in June prohibits all colleges in the country from using race as a consideration in admissions. California’s public universities have not used affirmative action for almost 30 years, but some of the state’s selective private colleges, and many out-of-state public universities, have relied on affirmative action to attract students of color and create a more diverse student body. date:2023/11/03\nDoes Affirmative Action Still Exist in College Admissions?\nA few decades ago, affirmative action became a reality in the college admissions process, an initiative that was intended to bridge the racial gap and bring blacks and, soon after, Latinos into the fold of the elite universities of America.  The basis of this rationale was to give these underrepresented minorities the same educational opportunities as whites and, in turn, provide them with the same employment opportunities after college. date:None\nHow will the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling affect college admissions?\nThe Supreme Court’s decision ending race-based admissions policies at colleges and universities leaves in place other forms of affirmative action like legacy preferences and early admissions — affirmative action policies that disproportionately benefit white students, says Katharine Meyer. Meyer looks at how underrepresented student enrollment dropped in states that previously banned race-based affirmative action, and how some have tried to increase student diversity through race-neutral methods. date:2023/06/30\nFor decades, affirmative action programs have been used as one way to bring racial equity to college admissions. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases involving affirmative action, and is widely expected to say the practice is unconstitutional. The decision could come in early 2023. date:2022/09/09\nWhat was affirmative action designed to do – and what has it achieved?\nThe US supreme court has banned the use of affirmative-action policies that have been in place for decades\nThe US supreme court banned the use of affirmative action policies in college admissions on Thursday. The court ruled that race-conscious admissions violate the equal-protection clause under the US constitution.\nEnvisioned as a tool to help remedy historical discrimination and create more diverse student bodies, affirmative action policies have permitted hundreds of colleges and universities to factor in students’ racial backgrounds during the admissions process.

A member of the Democratic Party, Albright was the first woman to hold that post.[4]\nBorn in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Albright immigrated to the United States after the 1948 communist coup d'état when she was eleven years old. Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957.[5][6] Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring.[7] She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie from 1976 to 1978, before serving as a staff member on the National Security Council under Zbigniew Brzezinski.

Michigan voters are closely split on which party they align more with when it comes to protecting democracy in America, while Georgia voters give Democrats a 4-point edge on that issue. Across both states, roughly one-quarter of voters say they trust neither party on each issue.\nAbout 7 in 10 registered voters in Michigan, and a similar 68% in Georgia, say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in next year’s election. And looking back, roughly 6 in 10 voters in each state say that Biden legitimately won enough votes to win the presidency in 2020 (63% in Georgia, 61% in Michigan). Among Republican-aligned voters in each state, however, about two-thirds express doubt that Biden legitimately won the presidency. There is no evidence of election fraud that would have altered the outcome of the contest.\n date:2023/12/11\nTrump Leads in 5 Critical States as Voters Blast Biden, Times/Siena Poll Finds\nVoters in battleground states said they trusted Donald J. Trump over President Biden on the economy, foreign policy and immigration, as Mr. Biden’s multiracial base shows signs of fraying.\nVoters preferred Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden on immigration by 12 points, on national security by 12 points and on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 11 points. And though a 58 percent majority supported more economic and military aid to Ukraine — which aligns with Mr. Biden’s policy — that did not seem to benefit the president on broader questions of fitness to handle foreign affairs.\nMr. Biden’s strongest issue was abortion, where voters trusted him over Mr. Trump by nine percentage points. Mr. Biden also maintained the trust of voters by an even slimmer margin of three points over Mr. Trump on the more amorphous handling of “democracy.” date:2023/11/05\nWASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A majority of Americans agree with President Joe Biden on issues including abortion rights, capping insulin prices and hiking taxes on billionaires, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found, but his campaign faces a tough task in getting angry voters to care.\nThe 81-year-old Democrat’s prospects for re-election have been dragged down by voters’ worries about the state of the economy, concerns about Biden's age and a general sense that the country is moving in the wrong direction. date:2023/12/13\nHow enhanced US-China relations can aid both economiesScroll back up to restore default view.\nIf you’re an incumbent president running for reelection, you have to convince voters they’re better off than they were four years earlier.\nThis is where Joe Biden is running into trouble.\nBiden’s approval rating is stuck around 40%, and Americans rate his handling of the economy even worse. In a recent New York Times poll, swing state voters said they trusted former President Donald Trump over Biden on economic issues by 59% to 37%, the biggest gap of any issue. Voter mistrust of Biden on the economy, in fact, may be the only thing keeping Trump competitive, given the 91 criminal charges he faces and general disgust with Trump beyond his base in the Republican Party.\nThe Yahoo Finance Bidenomics Report Card rates the Biden economy a B, based on six metrics we’ve been tracking since Biden took office in 2021. Using data provided by Moody’s Analytics, we compare Biden with seven prior presidents and base his grade on performance relative to his predecessors. That allows us to compare the Trump and Biden economies directly, at the same point in each presidency.

John Bel Edwards delivered his final end-of-the-year address Monday, highlighting some of his accomplishments in office over the past eight years and his vague plans for the future.\nEdwards, first elected in 2015 and currently the lone Democratic governor in the Deep South, was unable to run for reelection this year due to consecutive term limits and Republicans seized the opportunity to regain the governor’s mansion. \nAmong his accomplishments during his two terms in office, Edwards touted the state’s Medicaid expansion, infrastructure investments, the state’s unemployment rate reaching record lows and helping take the state from a more than $1 billion budget shortfall to having surplus funds this past legislative session. date:2023/09/19\nThe 2023 Louisiana gubernatorial election was held on October 14, 2023 to elect the governor of Louisiana. Incumbent Governor John Bel Edwards was term-limited and could not seek re-election to a third consecutive term in office.[1] This race was one of two Democratic-held governorships up for election in 2023 in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2020.\nUnder Louisiana's two-round system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate regardless of that person's party affiliation. If no candidate had received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 14, 2023, a runoff election would have been held on November 18, 2023, between the top two candidates in the primary.[2]\nState Attorney General Jeff Landry won with over 51% of the vote in the primary. This was the first time a candidate won a Louisiana gubernatorial election without a runoff since fellow Republican Bobby Jindal was re-elected in 2011. Landry easily prevailed over several Republican opponents, including former state chamber of commerce CEO Stephen Waguespack and State Treasurer John Schroder. Former state Transportation Secretary Shawn Wilson was the leading Democratic candidate.[3] date:2023/12/22\nRepublican Jeff Landry elected governor of Louisiana\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican backed by former President Donald Trump, has won the Louisiana governor’s race, holding off a crowded field of candidates. date:2023/10/15\nLandry wins Louisiana governor's race, flipping state red\nThe Republican state attorney general won a majority of the vote Saturday, averting an expected runoff election next month. date:2023/10/14\nJohn Bel Edwards\nJohn Bel Edwards (born September 16, 1966) is an American politician and attorney serving as the 56th governor of Louisiana since 2016. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the Democratic leader of the Louisiana House of Representatives for two terms.\nFirst elected to the Louisiana House in 2007, Edwards became Democratic minority leader in 2012. He defeated Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter in the second round of the 2015 election for governor, and became Louisiana governor in January 2016. He won a second term in 2019, becoming the first Democrat to win reelection as governor of Louisiana since Edwin Edwards (no relation) in 1975.[2] He is a United States Army veteran, having served with the 82nd Airborne Division, reaching the rank of captain.

Never before has a court determined that a presidential candidate is disqualified under the clause, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. date:2023/12/21\nUS appeals court narrows Trump gag order in federal 2020 election case\nWASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday narrowed but largely upheld a gag order that bars Donald Trump from assailing prosecutors, court staff and potential witnesses in a federal criminal case that accuses him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss.\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit kept most of the restrictions imposed by the original order, but lifted the prohibition on Trump personally criticizing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is overseeing the prosecution. date:2023/12/08\nTrump Is Disqualified From 2024 Ballot, Colorado Court Says in Explosive Ruling\nThe decision, the first by a court to find that Donald Trump is ineligible to hold office again because he engaged in insurrection, is likely to put a monumental case before the U.S. Supreme Court. date:2023/12/19\n\nQuestion:What are the current legal restrictions imposed on Donald Trump in relation to his ongoing trials? date:2023/10/20\nAnswer:"

Against all available independent evidence, CENI announced Felix Tshisekedi of the opposition Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) as the winner with 38.5%. Martin Fayulu, of the Lamuka opposition alliance, was said to have obtained 34.7% of the votes. The regime’s candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, garnered 23.8%. The participation rate was 47.6%.\nWhile rumors of a possible Tshisekedi victory had been swirling around the capital Kinshasa over the last few days – fed in part by alleged negotiations between his camp and the regime as well as the candidate’s recent benevolent declarations towards the outgoing President Joseph Kabila – the results are nonetheless highly implausible. Broadly reliable polling data by Congo’s BERCI and France’s IPSOS for the Congo Research Group (CRG) in December and actual voting count data by some 40,000 observers from the Catholic Episcopal Commission (CENCO) point instead to a solid and statistically robust victory by Fayulu.\nAs a matter of fact, and as explained in detail below, CRG’s data suggests that the probability Tshisekedi could have scored 38% in a free election is less than 0.0000. There is a 95% chance his real numbers would be somewhere between 21.3% and 25%. date:2019/01/10\n\nQuestion:By how many votes did Felix Tshisekedi win the presidential election in the Republic of Congo? date:2024/01/01\nAnswer:"
