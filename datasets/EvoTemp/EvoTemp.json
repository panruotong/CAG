                "text": "An analysis of fossilized dental plaque has revealed that seaweed and aquatic plants were once a staple food for ancient Europeans,challenging previous assumptions about their diets. This research,published in the journal Nature Communications,shows that the consumption of nutrient-rich plants and algae was common in ancient Europe but difficult to detect in the archaeological record. Prior research suggested that the advent of farming led ancient humans to largely stop eating seaweed. A team of archaeologists examined the teeth of 74 early humans from 28 archaeological sites across Europe,dating back more than 8,000 years. Chemical markers in dental calculus revealed that 26 samples contained evidence of seaweed or aquatic plant consumption. The study demonstrates that ancient people consumed red,green,and brown seaweed,as well as various freshwater aquatic plants. This suggests that the nutritional benefits of seaweed were well understood,and people maintained their dietary link with the sea. Seaweed was found in various regions,including coastal and inland areas,emphasizing its widespread consumption in ancient Europe.",

Serious scholarly investigation of diet, ingredients, and rituals of consumption progressed rapidly over the last decades of the twentieth century. The founders of the influential Annales (1886–1944) school of historical analysis, Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), encouraged academicians to use archival documents, such as wills, household accounts, notarial records, and institutional inventories to study the diet and food habits of the past. Historians took up the challenge. By the 1960s and 1970s, research on European diet and food habits from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century focused on alimentation: food and drink production (planting and harvesting), distribution, and consumption. Quantitative studies dealt with a variety of specific historical questions from determining caloric intake to calculating per capita meat consumption. Despite a variety of criticisms about the incomplete or imprecise nature of the archival sources, notable Annalistes, such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Fernand Braudel, went on to establish the study of food and diet as a legitimate means to better understand the structures of everyday life in European history.",

Before 1956, nominees' names were not made public:[2] the change was made by the awards committee to \"have a greater impact on theatregoers\".[3] The award was renamed in 1976, when Shirley Knight became the first winner under the new title for her role as Carla in Robert Patrick's Kennedy's Children. Its most recent recipient is Miriam Silverman, for the role of Mavis Parodus Bryson, in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window.\nSix actresses (Christine Baranski, Judith Ivey, Judith Light, Swoosie Kurtz, Audra McDonald, and Frances Sternhagen) hold the record for most awards in this category, each with two total.

This represents the most U.S. cases reported in a single year since 1992 (1), and the second highest number of reported outbreaks annually since measles was declared eliminated* in the United States in 2000 (2). Measles is an acute febrile rash illness with an attack rate of approximately 90% in susceptible household contacts (3). Domestic outbreaks can occur when travelers contract measles outside the United States and subsequently transmit infection to unvaccinated persons they expose in the United States. Among the 1,249 measles cases reported in 2019, 1,163 (93%) were associated with the 22 outbreaks, 1,107 (89%) were in patients who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 119 (10%) measles patients were hospitalized. Closely related outbreaks in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS; excluding NYC), with ongoing transmission for nearly 1 year in large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, accounted for 934 (75%) cases during 2019 and threatened the elimination status of measles in the United States. Robust responses in NYC and NYS were effective in controlling transmission before the 1-year mark; however, continued vigilance for additional cases within these communities is essential to determine whether elimination has been sustained. Collaboration between public health authorities and undervaccinated communities is important for preventing outbreaks and limiting transmission. The combination of maintenance of high national vaccination coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and rapid implementation of measles control measures remains the cornerstone for preventing widespread measles transmission (4).",

Laws passed before July 20, 2013, are grandfathered in, and a number of local governments in the Chicago area have laws that either prohibit or regulate the possession of firearms that they define as assault weapons.[80] These include the city of Chicago[81] and Cook County.[82] On December 7, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to grant a writ of certiorari to take up a challenge brought against a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which had upheld a local law banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois.[83] In refusing to hear the case, the Supreme Court allowed the ruling to stand and the ban to remain in place.\nIndiana[edit]\nIn March 1989 the Northwest Indiana cities of Gary and East Chicago city councils passed ordinances prohibiting both sale and possession of assault weapons. Gary City Councilman Vernon G. Smith (D-4th) sponsored the ordinance making it a crime to possess or sell assault-type weapons.[84] Both of these ordinances were invalidated under statewide pre-emption legislation enacted by the Indiana General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Mitch Daniels in 2011.\nIn July 2023, the Indianapolis City-County Council passed an assault weapons ban trigger law, which can only go into effect once the Indiana state preemption law is repealed or invalidated.\nMassachusetts[edit]\nBoston has a law prohibiting the possession or transfer of assault weapons without a license from the Boston Police Commissioner.[",

In the first round of Argentina’s presidential election on October 22nd, both truths were borne out.\nMost polls had put Javier Milei, a libertarian outsider, as the front-runner. Yet Mr Milei received 30% of votes. By contrast Sergio Massa (pictured), the Peronist candidate who is Argentina’s economy minister, won almost 37% of votes. The two candidates will now compete in a run-off on November 19th. Patricia Bullrich of Together for Change, a centre-right coalition, got 24% of votes and is out of the race.

So it’s not surprising that the two companies pushing the boundaries of reusability of rockets are also both developing methane rocket engines – SpaceX’s Raptor and Blue Origin’s BE-4.\nWhen RP-1 fuel burns, it generates a lot of carbon, coating engine components with coke and limiting the potential for re-use.

Compete out of San Fransisco with United as they currently do at O'Hare, Open up West Coast Hub Gateway at Portland Airport to complement Delta's West Coast hub in Seattle and United's West Coast Hub in San Fransisco. Less reliant on Los Angeles Airport in the near future with opening up the possibility of still having significant operations there by using Alaskas existing network. More likely I feel that American should push more for Portland Airport to be their Asian gateway because of the single Alaska Hub",

The storms quickly grew upscale and became severe, leading to a west-east line of severe thunderstorms which dropped south through southeast Michigan during the evening hours.\nStrong winds in the mid levels allowed for damaging winds to be the primary hazard, with areas of southeast Michigan seeing 60-80 MPH wind gusts which lead to extensive tree damage and power outages.

A surface low tracking through southern Lower Michigan was able to help spawn tornadoes, with an EF-2 developing over northeast Ingham.

But this justification leads to what I call in my book a “diversity bargain,” in that many white students see the purpose of affirmative action as to benefit them, through a diverse learning environment. This justification, which ignored equity, leads to some unexpected, troubling expectations on the part of white students.",

For employers, it required them to “not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin” and “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.”",

Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957.[5][6] Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring.[7] She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie from 1976 to 1978, before serving as a staff member on the National Security Council under Zbigniew Brzezinski. She served in that position until 1981 when President Jimmy Carter left office.[8]\nAfter leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of Georgetown University in 1982 and advised Democratic candidates regarding foreign policy. Following the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble President Bill Clinton's National Security Council.

Graduating number 1 from every school he has attended he first became a national celebrity thanks to a television game. It consisted in the candidates forming a team of two : one was to answer ever more difficult cultural questions and in case of wrong answer the other was to perform ever more difficult athletic performances. In his team Laurent Fabius was not answering questions but jumping with his horse above ever higher obstacles !",

He'd ascended pop's mountaintop as the outrageous half of OutKast, the best-selling hip-hop duo of all time. Then, without much explanation, he bowed out. He grieved the loss of three parents (mom, dad and stepdad) in a decade's time.

Michigan voters are closely split on which party they align more with when it comes to protecting democracy in America, while Georgia voters give Democrats a 4-point edge on that issue. Across both states, roughly one-quarter of voters say they trust neither party on each issue.\nAbout 7 in 10 registered voters in Michigan, and a similar 68% in Georgia, say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in next year’s election. And looking back, roughly 6 in 10 voters in each state say that Biden legitimately won enough votes to win the presidency in 2020 (63% in Georgia, 61% in Michigan).

In a recent New York Times poll, swing state voters said they trusted former President Donald Trump over Biden on economic issues by 59% to 37%, the biggest gap of any issue. Voter mistrust of Biden on the economy, in fact, may be the only thing keeping Trump competitive, given the 91 criminal charges he faces and general disgust with Trump beyond his base in the Republican Party.\nThe Yahoo Finance Bidenomics Report Card rates the Biden economy a B, based on six metrics we’ve been tracking since Biden took office in 2021. Using data provided by Moody’s Analytics, we compare Biden with seven prior presidents and base his grade on performance relative to his predecessors. That allows us to compare the Trump and Biden economies directly, at the same point in each presidency. And it’s clear why many voters feel they were better off under Trump.",

Incumbent Governor John Bel Edwards was term-limited and could not seek re-election to a third consecutive term in office.[1] This race was one of two Democratic-held governorships up for election in 2023 in a state that voted for Donald Trump in 2020.\nUnder Louisiana's two-round system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate regardless of that person's party affiliation. If no candidate had received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 14, 2023, a runoff election would have been held on November 18, 2023, between the top two candidates in the primary.[2]\nState Attorney General Jeff Landry won with over 51% of the vote in the primary. This was the first time a candidate won a Louisiana gubernatorial election without a runoff since fellow Republican Bobby Jindal was re-elected in 2011. Landry easily prevailed over several Republican opponents, including former state chamber of commerce CEO Stephen Waguespack and State Treasurer John Schroder. Former state Transportation Secretary Shawn Wilson was the leading Democratic candidate.[3]",

Law enforcement officials say organised gangs seek to conceal their shipments to Australian and European markets by bringing them into Sir Lanka, before switching the cargo into Sri Lankan containers and sending them onwards. Colombo’s high volumes of traffic and lack of effective security checks on cargo make it an attractive trans-shipment point.\nAccording to government officials, a spike in large-scale cocaine seizures (a drug previously uncommon in Sri Lanka) is a clear indication that the country is emerging as a key transit point for drug-smugglers. Counter-narcotics operations had traditionally focused their efforts on heroin and synthetic drugs. In December 2016, 928 kilograms of cocaine — the largest ever cocaine haul in South Asia — was discovered aboard a Colombian ship bound for India, one of several high value cocaine seizures in recent years. In March 2019, Sri Lanka’s police arrested two people and seized nearly 300 kilograms of heroin, estimated to be worth US$17 million — the island’s biggest haul of the narcotic.\nAccording to the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (the central government agency in charge of combating drug use), there were 79,378 drug-related arrests in 2016, a sharp rise from the 47,926 cases in 2012.

It was founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela). The 13 member countries account for an estimated 30 percent of global oil production.[2]\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the \"Seven Sisters\").[3] In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC.[4]\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources. OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil-market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel[5] (a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.[6]\nCurrent OPEC members are Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Angola, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Qatar are former OPEC members.[7] A larger group called OPEC+, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude-oil market.[8] Canada, Egypt, Norway and Oman are observer states.",

Against all available independent evidence, CENI announced Felix Tshisekedi of the opposition Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) as the winner with 38.5%. Martin Fayulu, of the Lamuka opposition alliance, was said to have obtained 34.7% of the votes. The regime’s candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, garnered 23.8%. The participation rate was 47.6%.\nWhile rumors of a possible Tshisekedi victory had been swirling around the capital Kinshasa over the last few days – fed in part by alleged negotiations between his camp and the regime as well as the candidate’s recent benevolent declarations towards the outgoing President Joseph Kabila – the results are nonetheless highly implausible. Broadly reliable polling data by Congo’s BERCI and France’s IPSOS for the Congo Research Group (CRG) in December and actual voting count data by some 40,000 observers from the Catholic Episcopal Commission (CENCO) point instead to a solid and statistically robust victory by Fayulu.\nAs a matter of fact, and as explained in detail below, CRG’s data suggests that the probability Tshisekedi could have scored 38% in a free election is less than 0.0000. There is a 95% chance his real numbers would be somewhere between 21.3% and 25%.",
