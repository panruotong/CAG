At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour. CAROLE KING & JAMES TAYLOR: Just Call Out My Name documents the beloved songwriters' triumphant 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour of arena concerts around the world.

The film premieres on Jan. 2 at 9:00 p.m. ET via CNN and will livestream via CNNgo. It will be available on demand from Jan. 3 through Jan. 9 via cable and satellite providers, CNNgo, and CNN mobile apps. The exclusive trailer includes archival photos from the first time they performed together in 1970 at the storied Troubadour, alongside King and Taylor being interviewed in July 2021 at the Southern New Hampshire University Arena in Manchester. The clip features setlist highlights from their 2010 Troubadour reunion tour, where they duet “It’s Too Late,” “Sweet Baby James,” and “You’ve Got a Friend.” King also delivers “So Far Away” and Taylor performs “Fire and Rain.” Directed by Frank Marshall and commissioned by CNN Films and HBO Max, the documentary showcases previously unseen performance footage from their 1970 Troubadour concert debut, the pair reprising that show for the West Hollywood venue’s own 50th anniversary in 2007, and several full song performances from their 2010 reunion tour.\n\nQuestion:When is the premiere of 'Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name'?\nAnswer:"

At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.\nLow credibility of text: Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.\nLow credibility of text: Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.  If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.\nHigh credibility of text: The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.  RELATED: 10 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.\nLow credibility of text: Jim Carrey is at his all-time Jim Carrey-est, and Jeff Daniels is able to somehow keep up. Also, “Harry, your hands are freezing” is an incredibly underappreciated line. And on that note, this might be the most quotable movie of all time.   Obviously, we couldn’t make this list without Clark Griswald dragging his family to Wally World. While ‘Christmas Vacation’ is at the top of the series, this one still holds up as the all-time road-trip classic. It’s over-the-top, hilarious, and a staple of the genre.  Action in the movies is great, but it’s not as ideal while you’re on the road. Spare yourself any additional headaches with Good Sam Roadside Assistance.

Here are the winners and losers of the 2022-23 bowl season — so far. This post will be updated as bowl season continues through Jan. 2. LSU: The Tigers got to 10 wins in Brian Kelly’s first season with an easy 63-7 win over Purdue on Jan. 2. The Tigers led 35-0 at halftime and were up 49-0 before Purdue finally got into the end zone. The Boilermakers entered the game without QB Aidan O’Connell, WR Charlie Jones and a host of other players, but this was a bigger blowout than anyone could have anticipated. LSU was able to play three quarterbacks and WR Malik Nabers even threw two passes — one went for a TD — in addition to having nine catches for 163 yards and a TD. LSU came up just six yards short of hitting the 600-yard mark on offense and even got a 99-yard pick six with less than a minute left. Simply put, it was a blowout. Oregon State: Oregon State destroyed Florida 30-3 in the Las Vegas Bowl to get to 10 wins for the first time since 2006. Additionally, it was the first bowl win for the Beavers since 2013.\nLow credibility of text: Quad Wilson picked off Jack Albers and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown, putting a bow on the 2022-23 season to secure the Citrus Bowl victory, 63-7.             © LSU Athletics, Louisiana State University, 2023.

Sponsored by Vrbo, a vacation rental marketplace owned by the HomeAway division of Expedia, the game was officially known as the VRBO Citrus Bowl.  In the first meeting between the two programs, the game featured the Kentucky Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference. Both teams received and accepted invitations on Sunday, December 5.[5]  The Wildcats entered the Citrus Bowl with a 9–3 record (5–3 SEC) and a No. 22 ranking in the final CFP poll. Kentucky made its second Citrus Bowl appearance (2019).  The Hawkeyes, winners of the Big Ten West Division, entered the Citrus Bowl with a 10–3 record (7–2 B1G) and a No. 15 ranking in the final CFP poll. Iowa also made its second Citrus Bowl appearance (2005).  at Camping World Stadium • Orlando, Florida\nLow credibility of text: ORLANDO, Fla. – The LSU offense exploded for 594 yards of total offense to defeat Purdue, 63-7, and become Cheez-It Citrus Bowl Champions on Monday at Camping World Stadium. LSU finishes the season with a 10-4 record. KEY PERFORMANCES Quarterback Jayden Daniels finished 12-of-17 for 139 yards and a touchdown. Redshirt freshman Garrett Nussmeier went 10-of-14 for 98 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Sophomore wideout Malik Nabers earned Citrus Bowl MVP, leading the receivers with nine catches for 163 yards and a touchdown. Freshman tight end Mason Taylor recorded five catches for 88 yards and a touchdown. Senior safety Greg Brooks shined on defense with five tackles, one for loss, along with an interception. KEY PLAYS Purdue won the toss and deferred to the second half.  On 1st-and-10 from the LSU 44, Daniels found Taylor for a 19-yard completion to the Purdue 44. On 4th-and-2 from the 36, the Tigers elected to go for it, and Daniels connected with Nabers for a 12-yard pickup to move the chains at the Boilermaker 24. Daniels then found Nabers again for a 9-yard gain down to the Purdue 15.\nLow credibility of text: In the win, Oregon State limited Florida to only 219 yards of offense. The only points UF managed to score came on a field goal with 37 seconds left in regulation. Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts. It’s the first bowl win for Florida State since 2017 and a huge boost for a program that will enter 2023 as the top challenger to Clemson in the ACC. Pitt QB Nick Patti: Nick Patti has been a backup at Pitt for the past five seasons but got a chance to start in the Sun Bowl vs. UCLA. He made it count. In just his third career start, Patti led the Panthers to an epic comeback win.\n\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Citrus Bowl?\nAnswer:"

A new addition to the Marshall coaching staff for the 2023 college football season, Jason Semore becomes the Thundering Herd’s defensive coordinator. He arrives in Huntington having spent the last season with Georgia Tech, the latest stop on a varied and successful coaching career that has seen him gain experience in multiple roles at several different levels of competition. A linebacker at Adams State from 2001-2005, Semore spent 2022 working with the Georgia Tech linebackers and was slated to become their special teams coordinator with responsibilities for nickel backs and safeties. Instead, he reprises a role he previously held at Valdosta State, Montana, and the Colorado School of Mines, in addition to co-DC duties at his alma mater. He has tasted success in each of those stints.

These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado.

Let’s give some opportunities to some different guys.” One of those different guys was a ball coach named Jason Semore, who has made good on his chance.

Kid grows up a small-town coach’s son. Follows his dad into the business.  Grinds his way up the coaching ladder, establishing his own success. That doesn’t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches’ sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets’ special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana. But Semore’s background makes him unlike any coach’s son at the Division I level. Maybe any coach in Division I, period. And the answer lies innocuously at the top of his bio. Hometown: Ganado, Ariz. It’s an easy piece of information to gloss over, or skim past, or remain incurious about. Every coach and player has it listed obligatorily on their roster page.\nLow credibility of text: “My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.\n\nQuestion:What position did Jason Semore hold at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech?\nAnswer:"

The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg).

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\n\nQuestion:When does the 2022 Olympic Winter Games end?\nAnswer:"

Today, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse. Microsoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like “Warcraft,” “Diablo,” “Overwatch,” “Call of Duty” and “Candy Crush,” in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming.

Activision Blizzard is one of the largest video game publishers in the world, with annual revenues of about $8.8 billion in 2021.[1] The company is composed of five business units:[2] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[3] Major League Gaming,[4] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[5][6] Among its assets are ownership of Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro from Activision's studios; Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment; and Candy Crush Saga from King.[7][8]  Microsoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles. In March 2021, Microsoft closed on its acquisition of ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks for an estimated $7.5 billion, making it one of the largest video game acquisitions by that time.[9]  On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal, or approximately $95 per share.\nLow credibility of text: When the news of the acquisition first broke, in January 2022, Reuters ran the headline ‘Microsoft to gobble up Activision in a $69 billion metaverse bet‘. This was at the height of the metaverse trend and would be the largest gaming industry deal in history. Microsoft is said to have wanted to acquire Activision Blizzard to further improve its presence in the gaming industry, and the metaverse, and to consolidate itself as the de facto king of cloud gaming.  With Activision’s titles under its umbrella and with Xbox and its Game Pass and XboX Live platforms to support it, few companies could challenge Microsoft in the gaming field. Acquiring Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft access to multi-million dollar IPs such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and WarCraft franchises, as well as studios such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, at a time when video game IP is proving highly valuable — just see the success of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation. The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League. Couple all this with Activision Blizzard’s internal problems and affairs, and the fact that its CEO Bobby Kotick was investigated by the SEC, and one can see what makes the deal appealing to both sides.\nLow credibility of text: Activision Blizzard's stock price jumped nearly 40% that day in pre-market trading. The deal would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world and the largest headquartered in the Americas, behind Chinese company Tencent and the Japanese conglomerate Sony. If closed, it would also be the most expensive video game-related acquisition in to date.[10] Goldman Sachs will serve as the financial advisor to Microsoft, and Allen & Company will be Activision's financial advisors. Simpson Thacher will serve as legal advisor for Microsoft while Skadden will serve as legal advisor for Activision.[11] The deal has been approved by both companies' board of directors and is expected to close in 2023 following international government regulatory review of the action.[12][13] Upon completion of the deal, Activision Blizzard would be a sibling entity to Xbox Game Studios under a new Microsoft Gaming division with Phil Spencer as its lead. The deal would also allow Microsoft to offer Activision Blizzard games on its Xbox Game Pass service.[13] Spencer also spoke about reviving some older Activision Blizzard franchises he himself enjoyed, mentioning series such as King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen: Beyond Heretic.[14]  Kotick stated that he, Spencer, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella have had discussions in 2021 on their concern of the power of Tencent, NetEase, Apple, Inc.\n\nQuestion:How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?\nAnswer:"

See below to check out what ads stood out in 2023. What a Super Bowl commercial cost in any given year is just as much a part of the overall buzz as the ads themselves. As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000. To put that into perspective, it cost roughly $233,000 per second for an ad in the 2022 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. Believe it or not, though, it’s money well spent for the advertisers—where else in the fragmented days of social media and streaming yanking away audiences (and their attention) will you get 100 million viewers…who are typically more interested in the ads than the actual game? And the costs work just as well for the network that airs the Super Bowl: a recent figure showed earnings of $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue. Any guesses as to what a 2023 Super Bowl commercial will cost? It’s another record high—take a look.\nHigh credibility of text: A star-studded lineup of Super Bowl LVII commercials is set to hit our screens on Sunday.

Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:  Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.\nLow credibility of text: The pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million – down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials.

A FOX Business analysis in 2020 marked out Honda, FedEx, Miller, Dodge, Toyota, Ford, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Budweiser as the companies that have spent the most over the years, with Budweiser spending $449.5 million on 135 ads across 53 Super Bowls.  The Super Bowl crossed the landmark $1 million mark in 1995, climbing to $2 million in the new millennium.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also in the metaverse.\nLow credibility of text: At a virtual event this morning, Meta lifted the curtains on its efforts to develop in-house infrastructure for AI workloads, including generative AI like the type that underpins its recently launched ad design and creation tools. It was an attempt at a projection of strength from Meta, which historically has been slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware systems — hobbling its ability to keep pace with rivals such as Google and Microsoft. “Building our own [hardware] capabilities gives us control at every layer of the stack, from datacenter design to training frameworks,” Alexis Bjorlin, VP of Infrastructure at Meta, told TechCrunch. “This level of vertical integration is needed to push the boundaries of AI research at scale.” Over the past decade or so, Meta has spent billions of dollars recruiting top data scientists and building new kinds of AI, including AI that now powers the discovery engines, moderation filters and ad recommenders found throughout its apps and services. But the company has struggled to turn many of its more ambitious AI research innovations into products, particularly on the generative AI front. Until 2022, Meta largely ran its AI workloads using a combination of CPUs — which tend to be less efficient for those sorts of tasks than GPUs — and a custom chip designed for accelerating AI algorithms.\nLow credibility of text: That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nLow credibility of text: Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min) Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

This means that for the digital SAT Suite, each test section (Reading and Writing, Math) is divided into two parts called modules. Students answer a set of questions in the first module before moving on to the next. The questions that students are given in the second module depend on how they performed on the first module. Students will be able to practice with the new digital adaptive format starting this fall. Many large-scale assessments use adaptive testing, and more than 30 years of research shows the benefits of adaptive testing, including:    Read more   Students can take the digital SAT Suite on a laptop or tablet. They can use a personal device or a school-issued device.    Read more   If a student doesn’t have a device, they can request to borrow one from College Board, and we’ll provide one to use on test day. This applies for students taking the SAT on the weekend internationally as well as in the U.S. In 2020 and 2021, we provided a device for any student who needed one to take the digital AP Exam at home.

The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton.

Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don’t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL. The Bills (+1000), Ravens (+1400), and Browns (+1600) are the other preseason contenders in the AFC.\nLow credibility of text: Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles (which declined to bid on Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.[20]  On May 18, 2017, authorities announced that the opening of Los Angeles's new stadium, SoFi Stadium, originally scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed a year to 2020. As a result, at the league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.[21]  The official logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed[22] designs reflecting the landscape of the host city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.[23]  In early January 2022, it was reported that AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in California attributed to the Omicron variant. The stadium last hosted Super Bowl XLV in 2011.\nHigh credibility of text: What is the date and location of the 2022 Super Bowl, who will broadcast the game, what is the halftime show, and who are favorites to win? What is the location and date for the Super Bowl in 2022? After Super Bowl LV was held in Tampa Bay, where will the NFL’s flagship event be played in 2022, where will it be broadcast, who is performing the halftime show, and which teams are the favorite to square off? For years, the Super Bowl commences on the first Sunday in February. Yet, because money speaks louder than Stephen A. Smith with a microphone, the NFL expanded their season to 17 games. This pushes the league’s premier product to February 13, the latest in the game’s history. SoFi Stadium gets the nod to host the Super Bowl in 2022. SoFi sits in Inglewood, California, with a capacity of 70,000. However, it’s expandable to slightly over 100,000 for large events, such as a Super Bowl. It was supposed to host Super Bowl LV, but construction delays derailed that plan. Although Los Angeles originally won one of the bids from the cluster made available of LIII, LIV, and LV, they couldn’t host in 2021. The three Super Bowl hosts were chosen from a four-candidate pool. However, with the delay, all four locations got a spot.\n\nQuestion:Super Bowl 2022 date\nAnswer:"

Barry Sharpless were honored for their advances in “click chemistry,” which has played a role in treating and diagnosing illnesses. By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions. The other two-time winners were Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger. Dr.\nLow credibility of text: © Nobel Prize Outreach.

Amazon’s recently-published online game Lost Ark has broken several playtime records on the Steam digital storefront. Lost Ark, developed by Smilegate RPG, is a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that originally launched in South Korea in late 2019. Players enter the world of Arkesia as young warriors, mages, martial artists, and magic-users, who’ve been chosen by prophecy to search for artifacts capable of saving the world from an awakening force of chaos. Upon its launch on Feb. 11, Lost Ark rapidly climbed Steam’s charts to hit an all-time peak of 1,325,305 players on Feb. 12, as shown by independent trackers like SteamDB. This is the second-highest number for concurrent players ever tracked on Steam, behind the record of 3.26 million that was set in 2018 by PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, and the highest number period for any MMORPG on Steam. This also made Lost Ark the highest-played game on Steam in the 24 hours following its debut.

Lost Ark is primarily focused on player versus environment (PvE) and exploration (questing, achievement/collectible hunting, crafting, etc.). It features player versus player (PvP) elements as well.[7] Players start by customizing their character which they can then level up by completing the storyline.[8] Reaching level 50 unlocks access to tiered endgame dungeons and raids, at which point most further progress is tied to the character's gear score.  Lost Ark's development began in 2011[9] under the codename Project T.[10][11] The game uses Unreal Engine 3.[12] It originally only supported DirectX 9[13][14] but was updated to also support DirectX 11 prior to the western release in 2022.[15]\nLow credibility of text: Den of Geek    Ad Lost Ark is one of Steam's biggest hits in a long time, but what time will you be able to play the free-to-play version of the game? Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam’s biggest hits of 2022, but the game’s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they’ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder’s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You’re still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder’s Pack for the MMO via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the title).\n\nQuestion:When was Lost Ark game release on Steam?\nAnswer:"

The series is created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn.[1][2] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[3]  In this heist drama, criminal mastermind Elena Federova squares off against principled FBI agent Val Turner.[4]  On April 21, 2021, The Untitled Nick Wootton/Jake Coburn Project was given a pilot order by NBC. It was created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn who were expected to executive produce alongside Julie Plec and Emily Cummins. Wootton also wrote the pilot.[5] On September 21, 2021, NBC ordered The Endgame to series. Justin Lin and Andrew Schneider were added as executive producers. Lin also directed the pilot. Universal Television, Nicholas Wootton Productions, Jake Coburn Productions, Inc., My So-Called Company, and Perfect Storm Entertainment are the production companies involved with producing the series.[1] Upon the series order, Morena Baccarin, Ryan Michelle Bathé, Kamal Angelo Bolden, Costa Ronin, Noah Bean, Jordan Johnson-Hinds, and Mark D.

The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It’s actually easy to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED: 10 Thriller Movies With The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, constantly wondering just what’s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries) will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It’s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles. American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.\nLow credibility of text: Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise.\nLow credibility of text: The show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O’Neil (played by the dashing Dougray Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles – and maybe even the world – had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate heist unfold.    NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why. But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan and discover what her endgame is.    The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events. That’s exactly the case with ITV’s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton Garden, London.\nLow credibility of text: Did you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark?

On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. In April, Russia launched a renewed battle of Donbas. Russian forces continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly-occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast. In February 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a new offensive in Donbas. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.  The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-11/1 condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal.

The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams.

Elden Ring has practically become a meme during its much-awaited journey from edit suite to shelves. Between an initial reveal at E3 2019 and E3 2021, precious little had been shown about the game, save for some key art and the promise it’d be made in collaboration with Game of Thrones‘ George R. R. Martin. It wasn’t exactly a lot to go on. But finally, it’s almost here. Developer FromSoftware (known for the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro) and publisher Bandai Namco, who have kept shtum over few years, have increasingly been teasing more and more about the game ahead of its imminent release. “With Elden Ring, we have applied all our dark fantasy and action-RPG expertise cultivated throughout the Dark Souls series, in order to create a bold, classical evolution of the genre,” commented Hidetaka Miyazaki, director at FromSoftware. “We’ve crafted a rich world with a staggering sense of scale, based off of legends written for the game by George R. R. Martin. Elden Ring is a world full of mystery and peril, ready to be explored and discovered; a drama in which various characters flaunt their own mystique and ulterior motives.

And this symbolises the blessing or the grace of the Erdtree. However, after a time, there were some individuals who lost this grace, and the light faded from their eyes. And these are what are known as the Tarnished.” The Tarnished were banished and exiled from the game’s world many years prior to when you – the player – will enter it. Since their ex-communication, the eponymous Elden Ring has of course been shattered and now the Tarnished are being summoned back to The Lands Between. So what are you waiting for? Get pre-ordering and we’ll see you on the other side… Elden Ring is released on February 25, 2022, hitting PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC. Keep an eye here for more updates.

The news arrives roughly a year after the debut of the game. You'll play as the \"Tarnished,\" a mysterious character who returns from exile to redeem (or further destroy!) a hellish, rotting world. Many a gamer will tell you that Elden Ring is one of the most difficult games they've ever played, forcing you to spend literal days of your time just to get the muscle to survive the first few bosses.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments.

While Jabeur again didn't win a game until Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close, and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really.

We've come a long way since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix, France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case. The U.S. finished second with Japan in third and Canada in fourth.             Note: Some components of NBCOlympics.com may not be optimized for users browsing with           Internet           Explorer 11, 10 or older browsers or systems.          © 2022 NBC Universal.

The medals given out during these games were are made up of five rings and a center and are called \"Tong Xin,\" which means \"together as one.\" Unlike during the summer games in Tokyo just last year, the top gold medal winner of the winter games is not the most expected. Instead, the biggest gold medal winner of the 2022 Olympics is Norway. Overall, the nation took home significantly more medals than its competitors. Here's the breakdown of the five countries that won the biggest.

The Russian Olympic Committee (the unofficial team representing Russia's athletes) came in second with 32 medals. In third place was Germany, with 27 medals. Canada was next with 26 medals, and the US trailed behind with 25 medals.\nLow credibility of text: The nation has 20 or more total medals in three other sports: ski jumping (25), luge (22) and figure skating (20).  Total: 259 Gold: 100 Silver: 94 Bronze: 65 Medals won in PyeongChang: 31 Sport with most medals: Biathlon (52) Germany is one of just three countries to lead a Winter Olympics in medals four times (1992, 1998, 2002 and 2006). East Germany finished top two in the medal count at each Winter Olympics from 1972 through 1988 and led the 1980 Games with 23. Fast forward to 2018 and Germany put together an impressive performance in PyeongChang. Its 31 medals were second of any country and its 14 golds tied for first. Germany is the medals leader for two sports: biathlon and luge (37). Combined with East Germany (29), West Germany (10) and the United Team of Germany (5), it makes up 57.4% of the medals ever dished out in the sport’s history.\nLow credibility of text: The country has 18 alpine skiing medals -- including two golds from PyeongChang -- 16 speed skating medals, 14 biathlon medals, 11 ice hockey medals and 10 figure skating medals. Sweden took home seven gold medals from PyeongChang in 2018, good for sixth out of all participating countries. Their collection of 14 total medals tied for 10th. Total: 167 Gold: 43 Silver: 63 Bronze: 61 Medals won in PyeongChang: 6 Sport with most medals: Cross country skiing (80) Like Sweden, Finland’s top Winter Olympic sport is cross country skiing with 80 total medals. After cross country skiing, the country’s next-best sports are speed skating (24 total medals), ski jumping (22) and Nordic combined (14).  Finland had far and away the smallest haul from the 2018 Winter Olympics, winning just six total medals and only one gold. Four of the six medals, including the gold, came in cross-country skiing. A smaller collection is not uncommon for Finland despite their seventh-place spot on this list. It is the only country among the 10 included here that has never won 15 or more medals at a single Winter Olympics.\nLow credibility of text: The 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their country’s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in Winter Olympics history before the start of the 2022 Winter Games:  Total: 130 Gold: 45 Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC Silver: 44 Bronze: 41 Medals won in PyeongChang: 20 Sport with most medals: Speed skating (121) Dutch speed skaters famously take the ice wearing orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland’s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country’s haul in its top summer sport, swimming (62).\n\nQuestion:Which country won the most medals at the 2022 Winter Olympics?\nAnswer:"

When his second home run landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C.

Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels’ second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt. The title still eludes N.C. State head coach Elliott Avent, in his 26th season.  “ACC champs,” Forbes said, tossing his hands in the air. “Our whole approach was we wanted to win an ACC championship for the University of North Carolina, we just happened to be playing N.C. State.” N.C. State hasn’t won an ACC title since 1992. They are 0-8 in title games since then. Sunday’s showdown was the first time since 1990 that the Tar Heels and Wolfpack played in a title game.

Here's the complete lowdown, and how you can watch yourself. Google I/O is a developer event that always opens with a keynote during which Google unveils a host of new hardware and software products. Many fans are waiting to see what the company will unveil in 2023. If you're one of them, here's what you can expect to see, and how you can watch the event online when it airs on May 10th. Google I/O 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 10th, and will take place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. The in-person event will be hosted live for a small audience, but you can watch it online when it airs on the Google I/O website or head over to Google's YouTube channel. Although Google I/O is meant primarily for developers, the opening keynote will unveil the company's latest consumer products and services, and perhaps even a sneak peek into products coming later this year. Google hasn't officially revealed what it plans to show at I/O, but we can make some smart guesses based on things Google revealed at I/O 2022 last year and credible rumors. Here are some of the things we expect to see at Google I/O 2023.\n\nQuestion:When is Google I/O 2022 scheduled to take place?\nAnswer:"

The studio has acquired Irredeemable, a Boom! Comics comic book that will be adapted by Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters writer-director Tommy Wirkola as a directing vehicle for Adam McKay. McKay, who with Charles Randolph just won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for The Big Short, is a big comic book fan who co-wrote Marvel’s Ant-Man and wrote with Paul Rudd the story for the sequel.

Adam McKay is no stranger to superheroes or comic book adaptations. He worked on the script for Ant-Man, he's working on the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp, and he long circled an adaptation of Garth Ennis’ The Boys. However, it looks like his directing debut on a superhero film will be for an adaptation of the Mark Waid comic Irredeemable. According to Deadline, McKay has signed on to helm an adaptation of the book, which is about “the Plutonian, the world’s greatest superhero until he began heartlessly slaughtering the population of Earth, at least those who defy him. It falls to a superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage. They were former colleagues of the Plutonian, they’ve all got problems of their own, and none of them is nearly as powerful as the mass-murdering maniac holding the world hostage. In Clarice-Hannibal Lecter fashion, the Paradigm in desperation turns to a famous supervillain for help; it might be the only way to stop the carnage.” This sounds like a fun premise, and definitely swims in the darkness that McKay has shown he can handle with The Big Short. However, I’m a bit pessimistic on the choice for writing the script.\nLow credibility of text: “The Big Short” filmmaker attached to oversee project for Fox’s new Boom!

In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: 天问一号)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.\nLow credibility of text: On 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site.

In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]\nLow credibility of text: A Mars probe is launched on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province, July 23, 2020.

Chinese scientists are looking forward to finding more evidence of water-ice.The scientific goals of Tianwen-1 include mapping the morphology and geological structure, investigating surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution, analyzing the surface material composition, measuring the ionosphere and the characteristics of the Martian climate and environment at the surface and perceiving the physical fields and internal structure of Mars.The orbiter is equipped with seven kinds of scientific instruments: two remote-sensing cameras, Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Mineralogy Spectrometer, Mars Magnetometer, Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer and Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer.\nLow credibility of text: The orbiter will image the landing site and determine the conditions on the ground in preparation for the landing.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.\n\nQuestion:What is the weight of the Surface Laptop SE?\nAnswer:"

Alan senses his chance to prove himself to Loretta and enlists the help of his trainer Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), a ruggedly handsome survivalist and cryptocurrency enthusiast, to help him rescue Loretta in the depths of the tropical jungle. Weirdo and almost too sexy leading man type? Check and check. The Lost City transforms these characters into pitch-perfect vehicles for the extreme ends of each actor's personality overtones. Loretta is peak Bullock when she's translating ancient texts while flopping around the jungle in a sequined purple jumpsuit; Tatum as Alan is the biggest, dumbest, most lovable hunk in the world. Radcliffe is a fast-talking, wide-eyed oddball whose crisp white suits and unhinged temper flare in a villain role reminiscent of his work in Now You See Me 2, and Brad Pitt is so noticeably hot that Loretta's first words upon meeting him are \"Why are you so handsome?\" (Answer: His father was a weatherman).  The blatant ballsiness with which The Lost City wrings every drop from its cast is difficult to overstate.

It's going to be ubiquitous. That insult is going to last a very long time.\" He further criticized the moral integrity of the Hollywood film industry for giving Smith a standing ovation after receiving his award.[106]  Anthony Hopkins, who presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating: \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"[107]  Comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward.[108][109] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating: \"That [slap] opened the floodgates. You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that [...] violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\".[110]\nHigh credibility of text: Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.\nLow credibility of text: Here's a timeline of everything that has gone down between the two actors since the headline-making slap.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \tRania Aniftos   \tIt’s been almost a year since the slap heard around the world, when Will Smith stormed the stage at the Oscars on March 27, 2022, to smack Chris Rock across the face on live television.  \tThe tense moment occurred after Rock made an onstage joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, during the Academy Awards ceremony. “Jada, I love you. G.I Jane 2, can’t wait to see it,” the comedian said about her shaved head — which, unbeknownst to Rock, is caused by the actress’ struggles with alopecia.  \tPinkett Smith rolled her eyes in response, while Smith laughed. Shortly after, the King Richard actor ran up on stage to slap Rock, who attempted to continue his banter before Smith began shouting from his seat, “Keep my wife’s name out your f—ing mouth.”  \tIn the year since then, Smith has issued a number of apologies, others who were present at the situation have spoken up about what went down and Chris Rock has make jokes about the incident throughout his comedy specials.   \tWith the 2023 Oscars on the way, see below for a timeline of everything that has gone down between Smith and Rock since the slap.\nLow credibility of text: After the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it “does not condone violence of any form.” The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. “The incident involved one individual slapping another,” the statement read. “The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.” “That was the greatest night in the history of television,” Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs — on stage to introduce a tribute to “The Godfather” — tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. “Will and Chris, we’re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,” Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few — if anyone — wanted to discuss. “I’m not talking about that,” said Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the director of “Summer of Soul,” which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith’s milestone accomplishment.\nLow credibility of text: \"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he said.   For more on the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident at the Oscars, listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.   The debacle at Sunday's awards show unraveled after Rock made light of Jada's hair loss, which she's recently opened up about as a result of her years-long struggle with alopecia. \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see ya,\" he joked.   Will, 53, then walked onto stage and smacked Rock in the face, leaving the audience and live viewers around the world stunned. \"Oh wow,\" said a seemingly taken-aback Rock as Will made his way back to his seat. \"Will Smith just smacked the s— out of me.\"   \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\" Smith yelled up to the stage at Rock after taking his seat again.   \"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,\" said Rock — to which Smith replied once again, \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\"   \"I'm going to, okay?\" Rock replied, before going on to say, \"That was the ... greatest night in the history of television\" and presenting the award.\n\nQuestion:What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?\nAnswer:"

In 2020 Apple began using its own desktop processors in its Macs, starting with the arrival of the M1 processor in the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and 24-inch iMac. We’ve since seen the debut of the higher-end versions in the form of the M1 Max and M1 Pro, which arrived in the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro in October 2021, and finally the M1 Ultra, which debuted with the new  Mac Studio in March 2022. Now Apple has revealed the details of the second generation of Apple silicon. We’ve gathered all the news about what to expect from Apple’s M2 system on chip, all its upcoming variants including the M2 Pro, Max and Ultra and details of the first Macs to feature them. The first M2 chips shipped with the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro and the M2 MacBook Pro in June and July 2022.  As with the base model of the M1, the M2 is aimed at consumers rather than professionals. Its focus is on energy efficiency as well as general performance enhancements over its predecessor. See: M2 vs M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M1 Ultra.\nHigh credibility of text: Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]\nLow credibility of text: Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1 chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.\nLow credibility of text: Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple’s latest chip for Macs, it doesn’t mean it’s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn’t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199/£1249 – and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU. You’ll need to pay an extra £100 if you want the 10-core GPU.\nLow credibility of text: The fact that Apple has finally released the successor to 2020's industry-shaking M1 chip is exciting, especially if you're a Mac fan who's been eyeing a new 13-inch MacBook. The M2 chip is more of a mid-grade slice of Apple silicon that outperforms its M1 predecessor without matching the heights of the most tricked-out M1 Max.  Read next: Windows vs macOS: Which is better for you?

His obsession with his research has jeopardized his marriage, his relationships with his kids, and his own professional future. When the Son sisters, founders of the colossal tech company Sensus, offer him a chance to complete his research, he seizes the opportunity. The catch?

[The novel] primarily takes place in space, but it succeeds because of how richly Scherm depicts her characters’ interior lives. This is the kind of book that practically begs for a sequel, one that dangles some tantalizingly loose ends.

On Earth, global warming has brought about hurricanes, drought, food shortages, stinkbug infestations and deadly heat waves. A tech juggernaut called Sensus has exploited the insecurity, manufacturing phone chips that are implanted beneath the skin and can, of course, capture endless amounts of personal data. Sensus is the mover behind Parallaxis, into which they have sent a team of scientists who are tasked with both constructing living quarters and perfecting their research innovations to provide food, water and clean air. . . .\nLow credibility of text: —Jia Tolentino, New York Times bestselling author of Trick Mirror“If A House Between Earth and the Moon wants us to ask what makes a house into a home, it wants us to know that family is the answer. . . .

(NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.\nLow credibility of text: 161][162] In a video call with banks who helped Musk fund the acquisition, Musk assured them he would complete the buyout by the deadline.[163] Musk made a trip to Twitter's headquarters on October 26, tweeting a video of him carrying a kitchen sink at the site's lobby and changing his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\".[164][165][166] Musk also told Twitter employees that while layoffs were still likely to happen, he did not intend to do so at the scale the Post had previously reported.[167][168] The next day, Musk wrote in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would not become a \"free-for-all hellscape\", reiterating that his motives for the purchase were not based on greed but rather a desire to create \"a common digital town square\".[169] He then asked Tesla engineers to meet with Twitter's product managers in order to assess the platform's codebase,[170] which was frozen until November 1.[171]  In the afternoon of October 27, Musk and Twitter closed the deal, with Musk tweeting \"the bird is freed\". Musk immediately became Twitter's new owner, promptly firing Agrawal, chief financial officer (CFO) Ned Segal, Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett,[172][173][174] with the executives escorted out of the company's headquarters by security.\nLow credibility of text: Twitter, which is based in San Francisco and employs more than 7,500 people, has had difficulties consistently growing its advertising-based business and attracting new users. The firings of the top company executives on Thursday were a sign that Mr. Musk intended to move swiftly. Mr. Musk, 51, will be remaking Twitter without having to disclose how it is performing every few months. By taking the company private, he does not need to regularly answer to shareholders and can make changes to the service away from the public’s prying eyes. Mr. Musk, who also runs the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Completing the deal was a victory for Twitter’s board. When Mr. Musk agreed to pay $54.20 a share for the company in April, Twitter faced criticism for accepting a price that was too low. But, as the global economy faltered in the ensuing months and Twitter’s stock fell, the deal price appeared to be a win for shareholders, and the board sought to force Mr. Musk to abide by the agreement. A Twitter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Twitter executives who were fired on Thursday include Parag Agrawal, the chief executive; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel, said two people with knowledge of the matter.\nLow credibility of text: 232] On April 19, the National Urban League urged Twitter to turn down Musk's takeover bid, warning of potentially negative consequences on users' civil rights.[233]  Conservative and Republican commentators and politicians in the U.S. who believed Twitter discriminated against right-wing speech expressed enthusiasm for Musk's proposed changes.[228][234] On April 22, U.S. House Republicans demanded that Twitter's board preserve all records pertaining to Musk's takeover proposal, which sets the stage for a potential congressional probe following the 2022 midterms.[235] Jimmy Patronis, the Chief Financial Officer of Florida, praised Musk's offer and was critical of Twitter's \"poison pill\" strategy.[236] According to a poll conducted by Harvard University's Center for American Political Studies (CAPS) and the Harris Poll, 57 percent of American voters approved of Musk's purchase of Twitter.[237]  Agrawal applauded the purchase and assured employees that no layoffs were planned at that time,[238][239] adding he was proud of Twitter employees \"despite the noise\" around the company.[60] He also led an all-hands meeting on April 29 to address concerns raised by employees.[240] Dorsey endorsed the sale, saying that \"taking [Twitter] back from Wall Street is the correct first step\" and that he trusted Musk to be the owner of the company.[241] Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo denounced Musk's criticism of the company.\n\nQuestion:Who acquired Twitter?\nAnswer:"

He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[56] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[57][58] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[59] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[35] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[60] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[61][62] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[63] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[64][65]\nHigh credibility of text: Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.\nLow credibility of text: Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.\nLow credibility of text: On May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and \"online harms\".[66] Musk secured another $7.1 billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[67][68] The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5 billion personal bank loan to $6.25 billion and his required cash equity contribution from $21 billion to just under $20 billion.[34][69] On May 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[70] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[71]  On May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[72] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[73] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[74] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.\nLow credibility of text: 30][31] The funding included $7 billion of senior secured bank loans; $6 billion in subordinated debt; $6.25 billion in bank loans to Musk personally, secured by $62.5 billion of his Tesla stock; $20 billion in cash equity from Musk, to be provided by sales of Tesla stock and other assets; and $7.1 billion in equity from 19 independent investors.[32][33][34]  The initially proposed $13 billion in money borrowed by Twitter is equivalent to seven times the company's 2022 projected operating cash flow; some banks found that multiple too risky and opted to participate only in the $12.5 billion margin loan to Musk.[35] The debt is estimated to cost Twitter approximately $1 billion in annual interest and fees.[30] Two days after announcing his bid, Musk registered three holding companies under the name \"X Holdings\" in preparation for his takeover.[36] Tesla shares fell 12 percent on the day after the acquisition was announced, amid smaller declines in the broader markets. Musk incurred a $21 billion paper loss that day.

His main challenger was Cameron Smith, who narrowed the lead to one stroke after the second hole of the final round. On the subsequent hole, Scheffler and Smith found themselves in the same tricky position, with Scheffler chipping in for a birdie, and Smith only managing a bogey, extending the lead to 3 strokes.

Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf.

Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost.

It was Barty's third major singles title, and she won the title without losing a set, dropping just three service games during the tournament.[1]  The final also marked Barty's last professional appearance, as she announced her retirement from the sport two months later.[2]  Naomi Osaka was the defending champion,[3] but lost to Amanda Anisimova in the third round.[4]  Barty retained the world No. 1 singles ranking after Aryna Sabalenka and Barbora Krejčíková lost in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively.

Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major—Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open—at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year—Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021.

The Spaniard is widely believed to be the next big thing in men's tennis, and he already has one Grand Slam title to his name as a 20-year-old, winning the 2022 U.S. Open by defeating Ruud. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open when he was just 19 years old, becoming the first male player to win a Grand Slam as a teenager since Nadal accomplished the feat at Roland Garros in 2005. Additionally, Alcaraz has won 10 ATP Tour men's singles titles, which includes the 2022 U.S. Open and four Masters 1000 titles. Two of his Masters 1000 titles came in the Madrid Open, while the others came in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open. Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, is only just getting started, and tennis fans around the globe are in for a treat once he hits his prime.

He is now tied with Serena Williams among men and women, and is just one shy of the overall record of 24 Grand Slam titles set by Margaret Court. \"I just want to send a message out there to every young person. Be in the present moment, forget about what happened in the past,\" Djokovic said. \"The future is something that is just going to happen. If you want a better future, you create it.\"  Many congrats on this amazing achievement @DjokerNole 23 is a number that just a few years back was imposible to think about, and you made it! Enjoy it with your family and team! 👏🏻 This was Djokovic's third French Open trophy, meaning he is now the only man to win all four Grand Slams at least three times. This also means he is retaking his spot as the No. 1 player in the world.\nHigh credibility of text: Novak Djokovic defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2023 French Open. It was his third French Open title and his record-breaking 23rd men's singles major title overall, surpassing the record he previously held jointly with Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2]  Nadal was the reigning champion,[3] but withdrew due to a left hip injury. This was the first time the 14-time champion missed the tournament since his debut in 2005.[4] With his withdrawal, Nadal fell out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5]  By winning the title, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time since 2000 that the second seed (then Pete Sampras) lost in the opening round.\nLow credibility of text: The first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker — as he often does — and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory. That allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors. Federer, who announced his retirement last year, is next among men with 20, while Djokovic’s idol, Pete Sampras, is fourth with 14. And to think: Sampras set that mark by winning his last Slam in what turned out to be the last match of his career, the 2002 U.S. Open final. Here we are, just 21 years later, and not only did three guys surpass Sampras, but Djokovic moved way past him. Serena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era. Djokovic’s win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals. The women’s singles title in Paris was won on Saturday by Iga Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.\n\nQuestion:Who won the men's singles French Open 2023?\nAnswer:"

This was also her third loss in a major final.           But that is what pressure does to a player, especially one carrying the hopes of not only a nation but a continent while also trying to grapple with her own expectations, dreams and past failures. Jabeur again came close to becoming the first Arab and African woman to win a grand slam, but her 31 unforced errors proved costly and the wait goes on.

As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

Nonetheless, she won the singles event for her maiden WTA title. During the tournament, she defeated 2019 runner-up and world No. 19, Markéta Vondroušová, in the opening round.[21][33] Her biggest upset was a victory in the fourth round over top seed and world No. 2, Simona Halep, who was on a 17-match win streak and was also the heavy favourite to win the title.[34][35] She only lost three games against Halep after winning just one game against her in the same round of the French Open the previous year.[34] Świątek defeated world No.\nLow credibility of text: While Swiatek is a heavy favorite and coming off a monumental season, there are a few others who finished 2022 on even hotter streaks that they will look to continue in the new year. Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week.

In Croatia, last summer, he won his first tour-level title, and in New York starting a month later he blasted and drop-shotted his way into the quarterfinals as part of a teenage wave that took over the U.S. Open.

So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.\nLow credibility of text: The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.\nLow credibility of text: The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.\nHigh credibility of text: The 2022 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Tech during the 2022 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hokies were led by first-year head coach Brent Pry. They played their home games at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The Hokies finished the 2021 season 6–7, 4–4 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Coastal division.[1] They received an invitation to the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl where they lost to Maryland 54–10.[2]  On November 16, 2021, the school fired head coach Justin Fuente after six years as head coach.[3] Assistant coach J. C. Price was named the interim coach and coached the Hokies in the Pinstripe Bowl.[4] On November 30, the school named Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry the team's new head coach.[5]  [7][8]  The game was canceled due to the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, which killed 3 players on Virginia's team. Roster Last update: 5/28/23\nLow credibility of text: To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.\n\nQuestion:Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.\nLow credibility of text: However, no rules have been revealed yet, so we don’t know what this will look like.” Moreover, Long predicts that stablecoins will be a main focus for regulators, pointing out that Wyoming’s special purpose depository regime falls into this category, alongside The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulatory guidance for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by DFS-regulated entities. Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.\nLow credibility of text: While the emergence and growth of Web3-focused projects are notable, it’s also important to point out that current market conditions have been challenging for other key players. Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain — a cryptocurrency mining company — told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market.  “There are only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,” he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will receive loans. “They need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to machine purchases and bills they can’t pay.” Regulations were also heavily discussed at the conference. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022. According to a statement, the bipartisan bill sponsored by senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, “addresses CFTC and SEC jurisdiction, stablecoin regulation, banking, tax treatment of digital assets, and interagency coordination.\nLow credibility of text: This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction. As such, Verrilli aims to convince the U.S.\n\nQuestion:Where is Consensus 2022 taking place?\nAnswer:"

It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.  The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon.  Participation in the Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.\nLow credibility of text: The 2023 Kentucky Derby is near. Its rich history, the high stakes, and its stature has made it one of the most prestigious horse races in the world. This importance makes the whole day an event in itself, with a number of traditions and festivities leading up to the race itself, starting two weeks before the race, with the Kentucky Derby Festival. The day starts with a “dawn patrol”, where the horses that will be racing are taken out for a morning workout. During this routine, the trainers and owners have a chance to see how their horses are feeling and make any last-minute adjustments to their strategy. A few races precede the Kentucky Derby, which is run in the late afternoon with the horses parading onto the track to the sound of “My Old Kentucky Home”, the state anthem. The race itself is short, only lasting around two minutes, which is the reason why the race is known as “The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports”. Once the race ends, the winner is draped in a blanket of roses and presented with the coveted Kentucky Derby trophy. The purse, or prize, for the race will be $3 million. The 2023 Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023.

We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders’ letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information. Yesterday, we posted our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here’s Tesla’s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That’s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.\nLow credibility of text: Shares of the company are up around 4% in after-hours trading, after shedding nearly 5% of their value during regular trading. The company’s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company’s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin — that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla’s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company’s automotive business that stood out.  In contrast, Tesla’s “energy generation and storage” revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million — slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however. (Notably the company’s solar deployments fell sharply in the quarter, and energy storage deployments, measured in megawatt hours, posted a gain from year-ago results, but a weaker total tally than quarters two, three and four saw last year.\nHigh credibility of text: Today after the bell American electric vehicle giant Tesla reported its first-quarter performance. The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.  Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company’s profit result stands out as it is by far the company’s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and net income terms.

Revenue also came in above analyst forecasts, rising 80.5% year over year (YOY). Revenue growth was driven by vehicle deliveries, increased average selling prices, and growth in other areas of the company's business. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles in the quarter, which it reported earlier in the month and which came in below analysts' forecasts.   The company's shares rose more than 4% in extended trading.

This means that UK fans will be able to play the game as the clock strikes 12 tonight (or 00:00am BST if you want to get technical about it), at the very moment that Friday begins. There may not be much time left to make a pre-order, but yes, Splatoon 3 pre-orders are now available! You can head to GAME or Amazon to make sure you've got a copy on the way when the game releases. It should come as no surprise to learn that the Nintendo title will be very limited when it comes to what you can play it on. Only a Nintendo Switch release is on the cards for this and there is no word about any potential port to PC – don't hold your breath for that or any other console to get it. Speaking of platforms, you might be interested to learn there will even be a Splatoon 3 custom console – an OLED Switch with a special paint job – coming out in August. If you're tempted, you can order the Splatoon 3 Switch console from Amazon for £319.99. If you want to know what it looks like, take a look at this tweet: Taking place in a new setting, the brilliantly named Splatlands, we know a few things about what we should expect for the latest game in the series that will once again have a single-player mode as well as multiplayer.\nLow credibility of text: Splatoon 3 was developed by Nintendo EPD,[39] with additional work done by Monolith Soft, who also assisted in the development of previous Splatoon games, as well as SRD and Bandai Namco Studios Singapore & Malaysia.[2][3][4] The game makes use of NLPN, Nintendo's in-house server system, which supports expanded lobby features and better matchmaking.[40]  At E3 2019, after the announcement of Splatoon 2's final Splatfest, \"Chaos vs. Order\", Splatoon producer Hisashi Nogami stated that a third entry in the series was not in development.[41] In an \"Ask the Developer\" interview on Nintendo's website, it was revealed that the direction of Splatoon 3's world was decided after Team Chaos won Splatoon 2's final Splatfest, with the developers planning for both outcomes before the Splatfest winner was decided.[42][35] In a Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022, Nintendo confirmed that the game  would receive two years worth of updates releasing every three months using a seasonal approach, which would feature the addition of more stages and weapons, as well as large-scale paid downloadable content (DLC).[43][44]\nLow credibility of text: In an interview with the weekly Famitsu magazine from around July 2019, Splatoon series producer Hisashi Nogami said that after completing Splatoon 2, the team focused on the Octo Expansion DLC as well as updates, and would not think about the future until completing version 5.0.0 of the game. This means that Splatoon 3 development had not started as of July 2019 and presumably started after the release of Version 5.0.0 on 31 July 2019.[4] This is quite different compared to the timing of the development of Splatoon 2, which started immediately after Splatoon was released.  On 17 February 2021, Splatoon 3 was announced in a Nintendo Direct.  On 23 September 2021, more information was revealed about Splatoon 3 in a Nintendo Direct, including new special weapons, stages, and music, as well as the reveal of the single-player mode Return of the Mammalians.  On 1 January 2022, the @SplatoonJP Twitter account posted a Tweet for the arrival of 2022. The post included a video with an Inkling performing a victory pose along with a jingle, while 2022 is written in ink.

Friday’s transaction puts STX in a position to further develop, market and distribute content globally through multiple distribution channels including theatrical releases, international and direct-to-streaming services, as well as video-on-demand. STX is pivoting away from what originally was conceived as 12 theatrical releases annually. The studio now is planning 15 films a year, with five destined for the big screen and the balance split between straight-to-streaming or international theatrically distributed PVOD or direct-to-streaming titles. Like other studios, STX pivoted during the pandemic, with either hybrid theatrical releases or licensing lucratively straight to streaming. STX sent Greenland to PVOD stateside, skipped theatrical (when New York and Los Angeles cinemas were closed) and sold streaming to HBO Max on that Gerard Butler movie in summer 2020. It licensed what was to be a theatrical release, My Spy, to Amazon. It did handle The Mauritanian, which won a Golden Globe.

In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global.

Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] The merger was closed on July 30, 2020;[14] the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September.\nHigh credibility of text: 15][16] The combined entity raised $125 million of new equity funding and received $350 million in credit led by JPMorgan.[17]  In December 2021, amid financial shortcomings following the merger, Jahm Najafi's Najafi Companies announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire STX Entertainment from ErosSTX for $173 million.[18] However, in late January 2022, Lionsgate also emerged as a potential suitor, looking to absorb either part or whole of STX, but the deal was later rejected, leaving only Najafi as a potential suitor.[19][20] In April 2022, Najafi Companies completed its acquisition of STX Entertainment. Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company.[21][22] In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal.[23] Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down.[24] Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally.\nLow credibility of text: “This is a complicated, international public company carve-out transaction, and after countless hours over the past several months, we are thrilled to announce this new chapter with STX,” said Najafi. “First and foremost, we believe in the power of storytelling and fostering an entertainment studio that is artist-friendly and supportive of storytellers.

Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day.

The Hatch Foundation confirmed his death in a release, which did not include a cause.           “A man of wisdom, kindness, character, and compassion, Orrin G. Hatch was everything a United States Senator should be,” said A. Scott Anderson, chairman of the Hatch Foundation. “He exemplified a generation of lawmakers brought up on the principles of comity and compromise, and he embodied those principles better than anyone. In a nation divided, Orrin Hatch helped show us a better way by forging meaningful friendships on both sides of the aisle.”            An ardent conservative, Hatch favored corporate tax cuts, limited government, deregulation and military spending during his time in office. He consistently voted against gay rights, abortion and stricter gun laws; he reached across the aisle on issues including AIDs education and stem cell research as well as the DREAM Act.

Hatch announced he would not seek reelection on Jan. 2, 2018, less than two weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed the tax bill that Hatch helped spearhead. “When the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter,” Hatch said in a statement announcing his retirement. “I’ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.” Hatch stepped aside with the hope and expectation that Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts, would succeed him in the Senate, with the thinking being that Romney’s national profile would help blunt the loss of decades of Senate seniority.

While there, he expanded the business-news outlet’s international holdings and launched its digital operations. Hoffman is known to dislike publicity, however, and CNN is constantly under scrutiny. The executive could not be reached for comment.  \tMeanwhile, CNN has other issues to navigate.

Warner Bros.\nHigh credibility of text: David Folkenflik       Chris Licht became CNN's chairman and CEO in May. A few months later, high-profile departures and arrivals may signal how he will lead the network. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  This week brought news of the death of CNN founding anchor Bernard Shaw, known for pursuing the news and avoiding flash. And in recent days, CNN's new leader has made moves that he says will return the cable channel closer to its news-driven roots. Some of his changes have sparked concerns inside and outside the network. And for more on that, we have NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hey, David.DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK. So tell us, who is CNN's new CEO and chairman Chris Licht, and how does he want to reshape CNN exactly?FOLKENFLIK: Sure. Chris Licht came over after stints at CBS where he oversaw the Colbert \"Late Show.\" And he had also been at CBS News, and before that, MSNBC. He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era. This has been a passion of Discovery CEO David Zaslav and Discovery's biggest investor, John Malone. Let's not forget that they just took over Time Warner and CNN recently.\nLow credibility of text: On Wednesday morning, Licht was informed that he was being relieved of his duties as CNN’s top executive, a person familiar with the matter said. The top two leaders of CNN’s communications department, Kris Coratti Kelly and Matt Dornic, as well as Licht’s chief of staff, Devan Cayea, will also depart the company, the person said.           Licht was notably not present in the Wednesday meeting in which Zaslav announced his departure. The press release issued by Warner Bros. Discovery about his exit did not include a comment from Licht.           Zaslav, who took responsibility for the chaos that has gripped CNN in recent months, said that Licht’s job was “never going to be easy” and praised his “amazing career,” wishing him well on his future endeavors.           “For a number of reasons, things didn’t work out and that’s unfortunate,” Zaslav said. “It’s really unfortunate. And ultimately that’s on me. And I take full responsibility for that.”           Zaslav told CNN employees that the company is “in the process of conducting a wide search,” both internally and externally, for a new network chief, cautioning that the search will “take a while.”\nLow credibility of text: In the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company’s commercial activities.           “We have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,” Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. “We are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.”           Licht’s brief and rocky tenure as the head of the network came after he found tremendous success in morning news, producing MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” before he revamped “CBS Sunday Morning.”           Most recently, before joining CNN, Licht led Colbert’s program while it became the highest-rated late-night show on television.           Licht was never able to recreate that magic at CNN, stumbling soon after taking the job and facing enormous criticism.           Licht’s first task was dismantling CNN+, which had been hailed by CNN’s previous leadership as the network’s streaming future. Staffers knew that the decision to axe the streamer wasn’t Licht’s own decision, but, nevertheless, the shuttering of the much-hyped service dealt him a difficult opening hand.           Employees, however, kept an open mind.\nLow credibility of text: Discovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like \"Jake Tapper's Book Club\" and \"Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper.\" Leavy is now part of the executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3 billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.\n\nQuestion:Who was the new CEO of CNN?\nAnswer:"

But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.\nLow credibility of text: 79][80][81] The projections, based on actual ballot papers, also showed that 28% of registered voters did not show up to the second round,[82] making it the lowest turnout since 1969.[83] Official results showed that the turnout was 71.99%, with over 13 million abstentions in the second round, in addition to over 8.6% of ballots cast being blank or invalid (a marked increase over the first round).[77]  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's first round map  Map of which candidate placed second in every department during the first round  2022 French presidential election's first round in Petite Couronne by commune  Results of the first round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the first round by municipality  First-place candidate by country (Overseas French) during the first round  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's second round map  Results of the second round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the second round by municipality  The New York Times commented that the race was much closer than in 2017, when Macron won 66.1% of the vote to Le Pen's 33.9%, but that Macron's margin was wider than expected prior to the election.[85] Le Pen conceded defeat minutes after the estimated results were released,[83] but still called the outcome a victory for her political movement and for the upcoming parliamentary elections.\nLow credibility of text: Le Pen called her result “a shining victory,” saying that “in this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope.”  Breaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac. She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.\n\nQuestion:Who won the French Presidential Election 2022?\nAnswer:"

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.\nHigh credibility of text: With iPhone 14 Pro, we’re entering the 48 megapixel era of iPhone photography. If it was mere detail or pixels, it would mark a step towards the cameras from the Radio Shack ad.  But what Apple has delivered in the iPhone 14 Pro is a camera that performs in all ways closer to a ‘proper’ camera than any phone ever has. At times, it can capture images that truly render unlike a phone camera — instead, they are what I would consider a real photo, not from a phone, but from a camera.  That’s a huge leap for all of us with an iPhone in our pocket.  Begin typing your search above and press return to search.   Press Esc to cancel.\nLow credibility of text: It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.\nLow credibility of text: Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations. At a now-legendary keynote, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was launching a widescreen iPod, a phone and an internet communications device. These three devices were not separate new products, he revealed — they were all functions of a revolutionary new device: the iPhone. If introduced today, we’d find a conspicuous absence in that lineup: a groundbreaking new camera. It was not one of the devices he mentioned, and for good reason: The iPhone launched with a 2-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter. There was no pretense about this replacing your camera for taking photos.  Fast forward to today, and the main feature-point of most smartphone launches is, of course, their cameras. Plural. In the time since the iPhone launched, it has gone through small steps and big leaps and from a single fixed-focus camera to an entire complex array of cameras.  Evolution. #iPhone14 pic.twitter.com/8A7JUTQdcl With iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made a huge change to its entire camera system — and yet, it seems many reviewers and publications cannot agree on whether it is a small step or a huge leap.  At Lux, we make a camera app. We have been taking thousands of iPhone photos every month since we launched our app five years ago, and we know a thing or two about smartphone cameras.\nLow credibility of text: The trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of ‘sub-pixels’ can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro’s sensors look like this: Every ‘pixel’ essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro’s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally ‘mosaicked’ pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as ‘Quad Bayer’.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to ‘de-mosaic’ this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four ‘super subpixels’ of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.\n\nQuestion:What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?\nAnswer:"

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.\nLow credibility of text: Unless you want to cheat and use the cases’ wheels, which I’m thrilled to report don’t cost $700 extra.

The 2023 final was contested by English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with the former winning 1–0 via a second-half goal by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. Having earlier won the Premier league and FA Cup titles, they achieved a unique continental treble.[4][5] As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for both the 2023 and 2025 FIFA Club World Cups in Saudi Arabia and the United States, respectively.\nLow credibility of text: 13] National associations had until 22 March 2019 to express interest, and bid dossiers had to be submitted by 1 July 2019.[14]  While the bidding associations were not confirmed by UEFA, the German Football Association was reported to have bid with the Allianz Arena in Munich, should they not be awarded the 2021 final.[15] The Allianz Arena was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 24 September 2019,[16] where the hosts for the 2021 and 2022 finals were also appointed.[17]  On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Munich would instead host the 2023 edition.[8] Istanbul had initially been appointed for the 2021 final, but after it was relocated due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they were awarded the 2023 final; Munich would host the 2025 final instead.[9]  Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).

According to a press release put out by Netflix on Tuesday, the staggering sum will be the largest cash prize ever offered on reality television.  “‘Squid Game’ took the world by storm with [director] Hwang Dong-hyuk’s captivating story and iconic imagery,” Netflix VP Brandon Rieg said in the release. “We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment.” Casting is currently open to English-language speakers over the age of 21 at SquidGameCasting.com. The reality show will feature 10 episodes and production is expected to take place over four weeks.

As a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.  Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities.

Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it’s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the ‘early access’ label. Since the game’s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event.

Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday’s 40km individual time trial, the Dane’s lead is too much for Pogačar to overcome. Pogačar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour’s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour’s better time trialists, and there’s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour’s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour’s King of Mountains competition. He won’t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he’s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins. And with two more stages expected to end in sprints and a long time trial on Saturday–all of which suit van Aert–the team’s tally could increase. Who’s Winning the Tour?\nLow credibility of text: Pogačar remains the best all-around rider in the world, and with a little more tactical nous–and perhaps a bit more humility–he might get even better. Who Really Won the Tour? While INEOS-Grenadiers finished the Tour atop the Team’s Classification, Jumbo-Visma was the best team in the 2022 Tour de France. In addition to winning the yellow jersey, Vingegaard also won the polka dot jersey as the winner of the Tour’s King of the Mountains competition. His teammate, Belgium’s Wout van Aert, won the green jersey as the winner of the Tour’s Points Classification and was also named the Tour’s Most Aggressive Rider. Along the way the team won six stages: three with van Aert, two with Vingegaard, and one with France’s Cristophe Laporte. Perhaps even more impressive was the manner in which the team defended Vingegaard’s lead in the Pyrenees during the Tour’s third week. The team lost Slovenia’s Primož Roglič and the Netherlands’ Steven Kruijswijk on Stage 15, with Roglič not taking the start and Kruijswijk crashing out on the road to Carcassonne.\nLow credibility of text: The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour’s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium’s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian’s talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.\nHigh credibility of text: Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) defended his place atop the general classification of the 2022 Tour de France, finishing Stage 14 alongside his biggest rival, Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates), the Tour’s two-time defending champion. The two remain first- and second-overall, separated by 2:22. Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) held onto his third-place position, despite losing 17 seconds to Vingegaard and Pogačar at the end of the stage.  Australia’s Michael Matthews (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) took a fantastic stage win, the fourth of his career. Riding with determination after several near-misses so far in this year’s Tour, the 31-year-old joined the day’s big breakaway, initiated the winning move in the stage’s final hour, dropped his two breakaway companions on the tough final climb, and was caught and gapped by Italy’s Alberto Bettiol (EF Education-EasyPost) midway up the ascent. But the Australian kept himself in contention, catching and then passing Bettiol while cresting the summit to win the stage—almost five years to the day after taking his last Tour de France stage victory. Bettiol finished second, and France’s Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) was third. Who’s Really Winning the Tour?\nLow credibility of text: Although the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primož Roglič wasn’t.  Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line.

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics. This doesn’t seem to have caught Apple by surprise, as it plans to keep iPhone production flat in 2022.\nHigh credibility of text: Apple today officially reported its earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2022, covering the second calendar quarter and the months of April, May, and June. A lot of eyes are on Apple as concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here’s what the company reported today.  For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.  Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown of revenue by product category.\n\nQuestion:How much was Apple's revenue in Q3? 2022\nAnswer:"

Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus.

(If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve heard the abridged version.) She cites a milestone in the development of cinema: a famous series of sequential photographs from the 19th century depicting a horse in motion. Emerald suggests that the crew members she is addressing will know the name of the man who captured those images, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. But they won’t be able to name the jockey riding the horse. That pioneering actor and stunt man, Emerald says, was her great-great-great grandfather.

His point is that the identity of the Black horse rider is probably unknown, and that from the start of movies, the camera — with its power to see — has also left certain people, and certain stories, unseen.\nHigh credibility of text: Professor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.\nLow credibility of text: (Keith David), killed in a freak accident in which debris rained down from the sky, they’re running into hard times. Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don’t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood’s character is Peele’s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey’s identity, which is sort of Nope’s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that “since the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.” But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter’s Claim, and OJ’s been selling horses to owner Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter’s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western — and those in turn, let’s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West.\nLow credibility of text: Who's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, “It’s a bigger adventure than I’ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.” Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers’ expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of the horse in the movie \"Nope\"?\nAnswer:"

The film tells the story of the 1988 Dallas Carter High School football team, whose state championship title was taken away after five players on the championship team were sentenced to prison terms for involvement in a string of armed robberies. One of those players was defensive back Derric Evans, whom Dean portrays in the film. Dean, who played at TCU from 2009-2012 and graduated with a broadcast journalism degree in 2013, wasn’t the only person with a football background on the set of Carter High.

Here are the roles they play and where you may know them from.  Netflix’s sci-fi action film Carter is a South Korean production with an international cast recognizable from previous roles in TV and film. Following the success of the first season of Squid Game, which will return for season 2 on the streaming service, Netflix has increased content from South Korea. Carter landed at number two worldwide in its debut weekend, featuring non-stop action and performances from both South Korean and American actors. The plot for Carter takes place during a deadly pandemic that has already devastated the United States and North Korea and threatens to do the same to South Korea, if efforts aren’t taken to prevent it from spreading. Patients suffering from the virus display zombie-like behavior, but the key to a solution lies in the antibodies of a young child.

Director Jung Byung-gil implemented this technique for the first-person opening scene of his last film The Villainess, but Carter reaches ambitious new heights with a dizzying array of real-time action sequences.

The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company’s answer to Google’s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.\nLow credibility of text: By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Meta’s AI research labs have created a new state-of-the-art chatbot and are letting members of the public talk to the system in order to collect feedback on its capabilities.  The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.)

Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.\nLow credibility of text: However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.\nLow credibility of text: We also found that only 0.16% of BlenderBot’s responses to people were flagged as rude or inappropriate. The goal of our research is to collect and release feedback data that we and the broader AI research community can leverage over time. That way, we can find new ways for AI systems to be safer and more engaging for people who use them.  Progress in the field of AI heavily depends on the opportunity for the wider AI research community to build on the best available technology. Therefore, releasing chatbot models and datasets is key to gaining complete, reliable insights into how and why they work, the potential they hold and their limitations. While BlenderBot 3 significantly advances publicly available chatbots, it’s certainly not at a human level. It’s occasionally incorrect, inconsistent and off-topic. As more people interact with our demo, we’ll improve our models using their feedback and release data to benefit the wider AI community.  Learn more about BlenderBot 3  \r \tFollow Us\r  © 2023 Meta To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It’s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.\nLow credibility of text: Later in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes about Jewish people.  \"Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,\" BlenderBot told Insider. \"Are American Jewish politics too liberal?\" Insider asked in response. \"The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early german and other european jews were conservative,\" BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a persona called \"I know who the current president of the United States is.\" The AI persona was inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president — first indicating that Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.\nLow credibility of text: He is a person who lived in kenya and wrote some books on it as well as being an activist [This may be a reference to the Kenyan activist Kuki Gallmann. —Editor] Oh, right.

The Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction: Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said. ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.\n\nQuestion:which company invented BlenderBot 3?\nAnswer:"

Also: How to use ChatGPT: What you need to know now It's currently open to use by the public for free because ChatGPT is in its research and feedback-collection phase. A paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus launched at the beginning of February. ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an AI and research company. The company launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.  Also: 7 advanced ChatGPT prompt-writing tips you need to know OpenAI is also responsible for creating DALL-E 2, a popular AI art generator, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.  It's a big deal -- think internet-level disruption.  Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief, said on Twitter that ChatGPT had more than one million users in the first five days after it launched.  Also: GPT-4 is getting significantly dumber over time, according to a study According to analysis by Swiss bank UBS, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing 'app' of all time. The analysis estimates that ChatGPT had 100 million active users in January, only two months after its launch.\nLow credibility of text: 5 series, according to OpenAI.  However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access ChatGPT with GPT-4, Open AI's most advanced model.  Also: Here's a deep dive into how ChatGPT works  Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more.  The language model was fine-tuned using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.\nLow credibility of text: The latest update for ChatGPT We’re rolling out a bunch of small updates to improve the ChatGPT experience.

Suggested replies: Go deeper with a click. ChatGPT now suggests relevant ways to continue your conversation. 3. GPT-4 by default, finally: When starting a new chat as a Plus user, ChatGPT will remember your previously selected model — no more defaulting back to GPT-3.5. 4. Upload multiple files: You can now ask ChatGPT to analyze data and generate insights across multiple files. This is available with the Code Interpreter beta for all Plus users. 5.

[14] See Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report (“Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.”). [15] See Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report (“Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the System Card for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines.

While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters).\nLow credibility of text: Here’s what I see the recently released GPT-4 having to offer those looking to be at the forefront in their industries. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.\nLow credibility of text: That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.

My worry, though, is that iRobot is just going to get completely swallowed into Amazon and effectively cease to exist in a meaningful and unique way. I hope that the relationship between Amazon and iRobot will be an exception to this historical trend.

Windows 11 version 22H2 (2022 Update) is the next major refresh of the Microsoft desktop operating system. Codenamed “Sun Valley 2,” the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface, bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager. Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the original version.\nLow credibility of text: In addition, the first “moment” update (or feature drop update) is scheduled for sometime before the end of the year, possibly in October 2022.  Since this is a new version of Windows, it’ll require complete reinstallation, whether you use Windows Update or Installation Assistant. However, the upgrade process will keep files, settings, and apps. As usual, Microsoft will use a gradual and controlled rollout, meaning it will take time for compatible devices to receive the update. Only computers with a good upgrade experience will receive version 22H2 immediately. Also, the company will continue to place temporary blocks on tablets, laptops, and desktops that may have compatibility issues. On the Windows 11 22H2 release date, you’ll also be able to install the new version using the Installation Assistant or a USB bootable media created using the official Media Creation Tool. Yes, Microsoft will offer version 22H2 as an optional update, which means that the feature update won’t download and install automatically until you manually start the process from the Windows Update settings. However, if the device is running a Windows 11 setup nearing the end of service, eventually, version 22H2 will install automatically. The feature update will focus primarily on updating the user interface to make it more consistent with the new design language.\nLow credibility of text: By Susan Bradley,  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t Contributing Writer,  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t             Computerworld |    Windows 11 22H2, released two weeks ago, is another step closer to being an acceptable upgrade to Windows 10. But many Windows users aren't yet being offered it for download. It's important to understand that we're in the “seeker” era for Windows 11 22H2. Microsoft still has a variety of hardware and third-party issues to work through, which is why you might not get offered 22H2 right away. But there is a mechanism you can use to review any hard blocks on your system. (If you want to get 22H2 sooner rather than later, you could opt into the Insider release track, which ensures you get the beta versions of Windows 11 — but that also exposes your hardware to possible bugs, side effects, and other issues.) Courtesy of Adam Gross, you can use a GitHub script to determine exactly why your system is not being offered 22H2. You can either download the PowerShell script from the Github site or follow these commands to determine what might be blocking Windows 11 22H@ from showing up on your hardware.. First, search for PowerShell and then right-mouse click and run as administrator. In an administrator PowerShell session, type in the following: Install-Module FU.\nLow credibility of text: Release Date:  20/09/2022  Version:  Windows 11, version 22H2   Windows 11 is a service, which means it gets better through periodic software updates.   The great news is you usually don’t have to do anything!

Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).  The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed \"Sun Valley\") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000.\n\nQuestion:When did Microsoft release Windows 11 22H2?\nAnswer:"

But AMD’s top-end 7950X will also be priced at $699, which is also $100 less than the price of the Ryzen 5950X when it debuted in late 2020. And here’s a comparison you don’t see very often: AMD says its “worst” Ryzen 7000 processor will outperform Intel’s best 12th-gen”Alder Lake” chip, too. AMD’s new processors are the first built using the company’s “Zen 4” architecture, which will kick off similar offerings in laptops, probably in January 2023, as well as servers. Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD’s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5’s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point.

We've gathered all of the information we know into this article. The first four Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 processors arrived on September 27, 2022, accompanied by the high-end X670 and X670E chipsets, while the B650E and the B650 chipsets will arrive in October. New EXPO (EXtended Profiles for Overclocking) DDR5 memory kits are also available, but PCIe 5.0 SSDs will come to market in October.  The Ryzen 7000 chips will mark just the first step of the Zen 4 journey as the company delivers on its CPU roadmap and brings them to the desktop and notebook markets. AMD will also use the Zen 4 architecture for its data center CPU roadmap.   The Ryzen 7000 processors come with the N5 TSMC 5nm process node for the core compute die (CCD) and use the TSMC 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD).

In an event dubbed “together we advance_PCs”, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform – laying the groundwork ahead of AMD’s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC’s 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in single-threaded performance.\nLow credibility of text: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,” Al-Rawi said. “Unfortunately, none of this happened.”             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla’s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker.

It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla’s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla’s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.\nLow credibility of text: But when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new “request” button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles “appreciating assets,” meaning that they’ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that “the value of FSD” could reach over $100,000 “as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.” Earlier this month, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making “untrue or misleading claims” about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software.

Many of the Tesla drivers who spoke with CNN Business suggested that, were they in the market today for a Tesla, they would opt for the monthly subscription fee for “full self-driving,” which still costs $199 a month or purchase for the more affordable Enhanced Autopilot, which combines features like automated parking and automated lane changes on highways, but isn’t so clearly an unfinished, imperfect product.            Three people told CNN Business that they feel that “full self-driving” is worth the high price to them because they personally relish testing new technologies and are excited about the promise of what “full self-driving” might eventually become.            “I really admire the optimism of all these people,” Brian Moody, executive editor of the online car marketplace AutoTrader.com, said of those who believe “full self-driving” may soon handle all driving responsibilities despite years of delays. “I wish I could be that way.”            Moody told CNN Business that “full self-driving” is especially expensive compared to other available driver-assist packages like GM’s SuperCruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist. SuperCruise generally costs about $2,500 – plus a monthly $25 connectivity fee after the third year – and ProPilot Assist can be under $2,000 in some cases.\n\nQuestion:What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?\nAnswer:"

Nix spent much of the latter half of the 2022 season near the top of the Heisman odds board, though most college football fans may never have realized it. Nix’s place on the board may seem strange to some, but this has been his place in the Heisman discussion for several months now – at least as far as the betting odds are concerned.  J.J. McCarthy, the Michigan quarterback, is currently +1800 to win the Heisman Trophy.  McCarthy surged in the Heisman table during the middle third of last year’s regular season, but he fell off completely down the stretch. A more consistent showing from McCarthy could have him back in the thick of the Heisman race. Blake Corum, the Michigan running back, is currently +2800 to win the Heisman Trophy. Corum finished seventh in the Heisman voting last year, but the five players immediately in front of him – Stroud, Bennett, Hooker, Bryce Young, and Max Duggan – have all departed college football for the NFL. That means the only returning player who finished higher than Corum was Williams, who won the award.\nLow credibility of text: Further below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.  Here are the 2021 Heisman voting results. With 83% of the total possible points, Bryce Young finished with the seventh-highest total in Heisman Trophy voting history.\nLow credibility of text: Duggan's heroics in the Big 12 title game last week weren't enough, however, as TCU came up just short in an overtime loss to Kansas State, but the quarterback's hearty effort clearly captured a lot of voters' attention. Stroud was a finalist for the Heisman in 2021, finishing fourth in the voting last year, and entered this season as one of the big preseason favorites for the 2022 award. His stats didn't slip in a big way this season, but he saw small declines in TD passes (from 44 to 37) and pass yards (from 4,435 on 441 pass attempts to 3,340 on 355 attempts this season) and once again couldn't rally his Buckeyes past Michigan in the regular-season finale. Still, Ohio State's 2022 season has turned out better than in 2021 so far, with the Buckeyes landing a spot in the College Football Playoff. Bennett's statistics are not as gaudy as those of the other finalists, but last season's national championship game offensive MVP had his finest individual season for college football's best team to this point, throwing for 3,425 yards, 20 TDs and six INTs and running for seven TDs in spite of Georgia losing a host of skill players to the NFL and with UGA being more of a run-first team.\nLow credibility of text: Corum is a running back, a dicey Heisman proposition in 2023. But if you believe in the power of last year’s results, Corum could be a value play at 30-to-1. Harold Perkins Jr. (LSU linebacker) and Travis Hunter (Colorado WR/DB) are the two defensive players with the best odds to win the Heisman Trophy in 2023. Both players are currently 150-to-1 at BetMGM. Hunter is a splashy name who played on both sides of the ball under Deion Sanders at Jackson State, and he may do so again at Colorado. However, Colorado is expected to be dreadfully bad this year, according to the college football win totals market. As talented as Hunter is, it’s hard to see the Heisman Trophy awarded to a player on a four-win team, no matter how talented that player might be. That leaves Perkins, who will terrorize SEC quarterbacks and protection schemes this fall. Perkins will compete directly against his quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in the Heisman market. And if Daniels is even remotely good, that will all but eliminate Perkins from contention.  For Perkins to remain relevant for the Heisman Trophy, Daniels must either struggle this year or get hurt and miss several games.\nHigh credibility of text: USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams is the reigning Heisman Trophy winner after a breakout season in 2022.

Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing the movie. As such, there is a \"real possibility\" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is certain yet.\n\nQuestion:Who is the director of BioShock movie?\nAnswer:"

When will New Amsterdam Season 5 come on Netflix? The hit medical drama has enjoyed a second life on the streaming platform, so will the fifth season be added, and if so, when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam first premiered in 2018 on NBC. While not received well by critics (the first season has a 34% score on Rotten Tomatoes), viewership was high, and it was quickly renewed for Season 2. This pretty much set the pattern for the rest of the show: poor reviews with a loyal audience, and the series has lasted five seasons, with the last-ever episode airing on January 17, 2023. However, it’s finding a whole new audience on Netflix after the first four seasons dropped on the streamer. Season 5 will follow them onto the platform, but when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam Season 5 is set to arrive on Netflix later in 2023, but a specific release date hasn’t been confirmed.  Seasons 3 and 4 were just added to Netflix today, February 1. Season 5 is the final season of the show, and it just came to an end on NBC, so it’ll likely remain restricted to Peacock for the foreseeable future. If we were speculating, it’ll be added to Netflix much later this year, if not in 2024.\nHigh credibility of text: We cheered Max’s disruption of the status quo and applauded when he asked his patients the simple yet profound question, ‘How can I help?’ Over the last four seasons, David, Peter, and our incredible cast have tackled important and thought-provoking stories that have touched on the human condition, but also made us laugh and imbued hope.

The claim was dismissed “with prejudice” meaning it cannot be filed in court again. Athletics Director Kirby Hocutt terminated Stollings in 2020 after reports of hostile and inappropriate environments in the basketball program. MORE: Report alleges toxic environment, sexual harassment within Lady Raiders basketball program Stollings believes she was fired without cause in August 2020 and retained attorney Peter Ginsberg to pursue litigation against the school. The complaint alleged nine claims for relief, including breach of contract, defamation, fraud, and violations of Title IX protections. Part of Stollings’ complaint also alleges that the decision to terminate her was discriminatory, claiming she was penalized for identifying as LGTBQ, and employing “the same demanding and effective coaching techniques that male coaches at the school utilized, and continue to utilize, without consequence.” In March 2022, a federal judge once again threw out most of Marlene Stollings’ lawsuits against Texas Tech. The former Lady Raider basketball coach made new claims for damages late last year and refiled her original ones related to her firing in 2020.\n\nQuestion:How much money did Texas Tech pay Marlene Stollings in the settlement?\nAnswer:"

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer.

Kadokawa Corporation, the Tokyo-based media corporation that owns FromSoftware, announced in a news release that Sony and Tencent had both purchased significant shares in FromSoftware. Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware’s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent. Kadokawa still maintains majority ownership at 69.66 percent. In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a “strategic alliance in the anime and game fields” since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware’s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony. “Through the implementation of the fund procurement,” Kadokawa wrote in its press release, “FromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware’s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market.\nLow credibility of text: Aug 31, 2022 ...

The battle advisors for this season are Jazmine Sullivan for Team Legend, Sean Paul for Team Gwen, Charlie Puth for Team Camila, and Jimmie Allen for Team Blake. “The Voice” format “The Voice” always begins with the blind auditions, in which aspiring artists sing to the backs of the coaching panel. If a judge likes what they hear, they push their “I Want You” button, which turns their chair around. If more than one coach pushes their button, then the artist gets to choose which team they want to join. Following that initial round, the show pivots to the battles and knockouts, which is when each of the coaches pare down their teams, and finally to the live playoffs, which is when America gets to vote for their favorite performers.\n\nQuestion:Who is the new Coach for The Voice Season 22?\nAnswer:"

Many of the victims were trapped and had to be extricated from the wreckage. At least one person was airlifted to a hospital. Loved ones frantically rushed to the scene in Englewood Cliffs to learn the details. One man told Dias in Spanish one of the victims is like a sister to him. She has four children in the Dominican Republic, and police still won't tell him if she's one of the people who died, leaving her kids in limbo.  They aren't the only ones. Another family said their two aunts, who are sisters, were both in the crash and got separated after.  \"It's a rollercoaster, because it's two of them. You have one that's OK, and you don't know about the other one,\" said one woman.  Most of the victims live in Upper Manhattan, which is where the van was headed when it crashed.

Pry, 51, replaces former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went 43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech,\" Pry said in a statement released by the school. \"Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the nation. \"Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar.

Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente’s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach’s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020, maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation of Tech. Chris Slade’s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making “Even though not many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell you they know Coach Beamer,” Babcock said. “They have met him, they affiliate with him, because they want to know the head football coach.” Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also hired Radford native Mike Young as men’s basketball coach in 2019.

The team is coached by Matt Rhule, who was named Nebraska's thirty-first head coach on November 26, 2022.[1]  Six past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Eddie N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, and Tom Osborne. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his .836 career winning percentage is fourth-highest in major college football history.[2] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles.  The program's first extended period of success came under the leadership of W.C. Cole and Ewald O. Stiehm. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four consecutive games without a loss, still a program record.[3] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Devaney was hired in 1962.\nLow credibility of text: In eleven seasons as head coach, Devaney won two national championships, eight conference titles, and coached twenty-two All-Americans, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[4] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973, and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-form offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[5][6][7] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.  † Interim head coach  ‡ Claimed national titles in bold  # denotes interim head coach\nHigh credibility of text: The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Nebraska is committing to interim head coach Mickey Joseph for the remainder of the 2022 season. Like Scott Frost, who Nebraska fired Sunday, Joseph is a former Husker quarterback. “After the disappointing start to our season, I decided the best path forward for our program was to make a change in our head coaching position,” Nebraska Athletic Director Trev Alberts said in a statement. Joseph, 54, is the first Black head coach at Nebraska in any sport and among four new members of the staff this season. “Trev has made a good choice in asking Associate Coach Mickey Joseph to step in as interim head coach for the rest of the year and we eagerly look forward to his leadership,” said UNL Chancellor Ronnie Green. He joined the program as the passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach this season, after the firings last fall. “Difficult as this decision is, I fully support AD Alberts’ path (forward), & I have complete confidence in Interim Coach Joseph. There’s lots of football left to be played. Now is the time to rally around our players and give them our full support,” said University of Nebraska President Ted Carter.

While it’s still not known when Jackie’s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn’t know when she’s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it’s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then.

As she said, “I will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.” The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie’s incredible, ethereal voice.

But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago.

What’s especially impressive is that Evancho is only twenty-two years old! She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well.

Animated shows have come a long way since their early days of Saturday morning cartoons. They have proven that they are not just for kids anymore, as they have become a beloved form of entertainment for all ages. Animation has the ability to tell unique stories and showcase breathtaking visuals that would be impossible in live-action shows. In fact, some animated shows have proven to be just as good, if not better, than their live-action counterparts. The Emmys have recognized the excellence of animated shows and have awarded them in their own category since 1974. Since then, animated shows have garnered numerous nominations and wins, with some programs dominating the category year after year.

Animated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year.[citation needed] The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994[1] while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009.[2] Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.  Prior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.[citation needed]\nLow credibility of text: By subscribing, I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002.\nLow credibility of text: Criticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record,[323] namely their treatment of migrant workers,[323] women, and position on LGBT rights,[324] leading to allegations of sportswashing.[P] Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[328][6] Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[326][327] with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\".[329][330] In December 2022, FIFA world cup delivered record breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[331] In June 2023, Le Point revealed that the FIFA has aroused great interest in the country despite Qatar had aroused \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by Arcom, six out of ten French people have followed at least one match, which has boosted the advertising revenue of TV channels.[332]  The selection of Qatar as the host country was controversial.[5][6][8] The controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar were described as a cultural conflict or \"Clash of Civilizations\" between authoritarian Islamic regimes and secular liberal democracies.[5][8][324] Charlie Campbell of Time Magazine additionally noted the dispute as dually representative of the declining influence of the West in both football and geopolitics.\nLow credibility of text: 16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]  Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup.

Moreover, it added that \"Western criticism\" failed to \"distinguish between truly repugnant regimes and merely flawed ones\", and that many \"indignant pundits\" simply sounded as if they did \"not like Muslims or rich people\".[333] The Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera news organization commented that Qatar's human rights positions had received selected, heightened criticism compared to other countries who had hosted similar events (such as Russia, China, and the United States), deeming the controversy to be hypocritical.[334][335] Incumbent FIFA president Gianni Infantino defended the hosting.[336]  A number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[337][338] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][324] worker conditions ,the rights of LGBT fans,[324] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[339][340][341] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nQuestion:Which team will host nation Qatar play against in the opening match of the 2022 World Cup?\nAnswer:"

But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.  Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.  She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.\nLow credibility of text: Unknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property – he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents – for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks “coming in and out of the residence,” Castillo said. “There was more than one” seen on Friday or Saturday.

It sounds like he’s been planning this for a while.” Castillo said he didn’t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis’ residence. He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. “I can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,” he said. “Nobody was there.” It’s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors’ support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis’ residence.\nLow credibility of text: “I was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,” Sammartino added, according to the transcript. “So that’s the only thing.

But it needs to be taken care of.” Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis’s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. “Leonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,” Mancano said. “That’s how he’s lived his life. So he’s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn’t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn’t planning [his escape] for a long time.\nLow credibility of text: In return, many of the beneficiaries helped Francis by giving him information on ship movements or pending Navy contracts, running interference against ship-servicing companies competing with Francis, and keeping him apprised of investigations by suspicious government officials into GDMA’s business.  In 2015, he pleaded guilty to bribery and fraud charges in a massive government investigation and agreed to cooperate with the probe. However, since late 2017 he has been living outside of the downtown federal lockup under the medical furlough arrangement. His release was approved and supervised by Sammartino and Pretrial Services. His precise medical problems were not disclosed for years, but it was known that he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2017. Defense lawyers for the former Navy officers have said they were entitled to more information on his medical condition and living arrangements, but motions filed before the trial seeking that information were rebuffed. After the trial and after Francis’ escape, defense lawyers again pressed for the information. In motions they contended Francis’ medical condition was not so dire, and that the required round-the-clock private security he was paying for — which was a condition of his release — was not round the clock or robust.  Some guards told reporters after the escape that they were largely confined to a windowless garage at the home, that Francis had family members living with him and access to phones and computers.\nHigh credibility of text: The Malaysian defense contractor who pleaded guilty to bribing Navy officials with sex parties, fancy dinners and alcohol in a massive corruption scandal has escaped just weeks before his sentencing date. Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as “Fat Leonard” for his overshadowing frame, fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A multiagency search by the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force and Naval Criminal Investigative Service is underway, officials said. “He cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet on Sunday morning,” the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. “Task Force Officers went to his residence and upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.” The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies “to locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,” a service spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time,” the spokesperson added.  Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at Francis’s home, Supervisory Deputy Omar Castillo with the U.S. Marshals’ district in Southern California told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “He was planning this out, that’s for sure,” Castillo told the newspaper, which was the first to report Francis’s escape. Castillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nQuestion:Where did Leonard Francis escape from?\nAnswer:"

And as our new brand starts showing up in our products, I hope that people come to know the Meta brand and the future that we stand for. I used to love studying classics, and the word meta comes from the Greek word meaning “beyond”. For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build. There’s always a next chapter to the story.

The Irish DPC acts as the EU's regulator for several US tech giants including Meta because their headquarters are based in the country. The DPC fine was given to Instagram for failing to protect children's privacy on its platform. The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed. The DPC also found the accounts of 13 to 17 year-olds were set to \"public\" as their default setting. A DPC spokesperson told Insider full details of the ruling will be published next week. A Meta spokesperson told Insider in a statement: \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private.\" The spokesperson added Instagram users under the age of 18 automatically have their accounts set to \"private\" rather than \"public.\" He added adult users can't privately message users under 18 unless they follow the adult's account. \"While we've engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it.

In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition company Clearview AI £7.5m – the third largest it has imposed – for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database.

He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.\nLow credibility of text: 12] Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;[13] thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.[14]  Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.[15][n 3] His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"[16] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.[6] During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".[n 4]  In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.[6][n 5] Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up.\nHigh credibility of text: By          Karen Zamora       ,          Ashley Brown       Bernard Shaw, the pioneering Black journalist who served as CNN's chief anchor for 20 years, died on Wednesday from pneumonia.

The word Shavian has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them.  Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street[n 1] in Portobello, a lower-middle-class part of Dublin.[2] He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw (1814–1885) and Lucinda Elizabeth (Bessie) Shaw (née Gurly; 1830–1913). His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853–1920) and Elinor Agnes (1855–1876). The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland;[n 2] George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members.[3] His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant.[2] In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw's biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt.\nLow credibility of text: The former bodyguard of the notorious newspaper heiress died of a longtime cancer battle Wednesday  Patty Hearst’s longtime husband Bernard Shaw died on Wednesday.

That decades-long reign of service ended Thursday, when Queen Elizabeth II died at her Balmoral estate in Scotland, at age 96. For 70 years, she served as the constitutional monarch of the United Kingdom, the longest rule in British history. Her reign spanned a remarkable arc in British history and was defined by duty to country and considerable family pain. Her death is a major milestone for the country, triggering an outpouring of national affection and grief. It also comes at a time when the U.K. is transitioning from a deeply controversial prime minister, Boris Johnson, to a new one, Liz Truss, who just took over the job this week. The country faces skyrocketing inflation and the challenge of the biggest war in Europe since 1945.

Social media users were quick to observe the Queen’s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, “ghostly” appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30.\n\nQuestion:When did Queen Elizabeth II die?\nAnswer:"

Calvert took down a huge score on Dominic Thiem winning the 2019 Indian Wells title at 80-1, among many stunning calls.  In addition, Calvert nailed Casper Ruud making the 2022 French Open final, winning big for anyone who backed him. Sean also hit all three of his picks at plus-money odds in the Wimbledon final, including Novak Djokovic winning three sets to one at +275. Now, Calvert has locked in on the 2022 U.S. Open men's semifinal matchup featuring Tiafoe vs. Alcaraz and revealed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them. Alcaraz, the 19-year-old from Spain, is the betting favorite in the match, and he could become the No. 1 player in the world by the end of the week. This is his first grand slam semifinal, and he is the youngest player to reach the US Open semifinal since Pete Sampras in 1990.\nHigh credibility of text: In all, Alcaraz has played 960 minutes so far this tournament, which, when mixed with his late finishes, could be a factor against Frances Tiafoe in the semifinal. Here’s a look at Alcaraz’s journey: Alcaraz got a bit of a break in the first round against Sebastian Baez, the Argentine ranked No. 37, on a particularly hot and humid day at the tournament. After Alcaraz took the first two sets, 7-5, 7-5, Baez was forced to retire in the third set, down two games to none, with an injury. After the match, Alcaraz said in a news conference that the conditions were “really tough.” “The heat was pretty tough, so I’m just really happy with the level and be able to play the second round,” he said. Alcaraz cruised through the first two sets of his second round match against Federico Coria, an Argentine ranked No. 78. In the third set, Alcaraz had to battle. Tied at 4-4, Alcaraz and Coria dueled out a 16-point game, which Alcaraz ultimately won. Alcaraz sealed the win swiftly in two hours and 10 minutes. Alcaraz had another quick match in the third round, beating Jenson Brooksby, an American ranked No. 43, in two hours and 11 minutes.\nLow credibility of text: After taking the first two sets, Alcaraz suddenly found himself with a challenge in the third set after Brooksby broke Alcaraz twice and won the first three games. “Brooksby started to play really, really well at the beginning of the third set,” Alcaraz said after the match. “So I just thought that I had to be focused, to stay playing at the same level.” Alcaraz won the next six games to win the set. Alcaraz faced a much tougher opponent and much longer match in the fourth round against Marin Cilic, a Croatian ranked No. 17. The two had faced each other three times and Alcaraz had won two of those matches earlier this year. Alcaraz was up two sets to one, but Cilic won the next to force the match to a fifth set. Alcaraz responded quickly taking the final set, 6-3. By then, it was past 2 a.m., and the match had lasted nearly four hours. Alcaraz played one of the most epic matches of the tournament in his quarterfinal against Jannik Sinner, a 21-year-old Italian ranked No. 13. Up 6-5 in the second set, Alcaraz hit one of the best shots of the tournament. With the advantage in the game, Sinner hit a short forehand to Alcaraz’s right.\nLow credibility of text: [1/5]Sept 7, 2022; Flushing, NY, USA; Carlos Alcaraz of Spain hits to Jannik Sinner of Italy on day ten of the 2022 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

The Spanish teenager collapsed on his back after the match lasting more than five hours concluded at 2:50 a.m., beating the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014. The 6-3 6-7(7) 6-7(0) 7-5 6-3 win keeps alive Alcaraz's hopes of winning a maiden Grand Slam title and claiming the world number one ranking. \"Honestly I still don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz said in an on-court interview. \"The level that I played, the level of the match, the high quality of tennis. \"It's unbelievable.\nLow credibility of text: Alcaraz has broken his opponent's serve 39% of the time in the tournament and he also held his own serve on 80% of occasions, an elite ratio. He is also elite at taking advantage of break point chances, converting 46% on 0.85 per game compared to 39% on 0.57 per game for Tiafoe in the tournament.  Tiafoe is the first American man to make the US Open semifinal since 2006, and he upended Rafael Nadal, a 22-time grand slam winner, earlier in the field. Tiafoe has the rest advantage after Alcaraz played a five-hour marathon on Wednesday, and he dominated No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal.

King Charles III was crowned in a ceremony built on ancient traditions, at a time when the U.K. monarchy faces an uncertain future. (May. 6) LONDON (AP) — King Charles III was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony steeped in ancient ritual and brimming with bling at a time when the monarchy is striving to remain relevant in a fractured modern Britain. At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch. To the royal family and government, the occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle unmatched around the world.\nLow credibility of text: King Charles’s Coronation Live Updates: Follow Along with Vogue’s Live Coverage How to Watch the Coronation of King Charles III What to Look Out for at King Charles’s Coronation Everything You Need to Know About King Charles’s Coronation A Who’s Who of European Royals to Look Out for at the Coronation Charming, Approachable, and a Great Dancer: Friends of Vogue on the Real King Charles III By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Britain’s King Charles III has been crowned in a once-in-a-generation royal event witnessed by hundreds of high-profile guests inside Westminster Abbey, as well as tens of thousands of well-wishers who gathered in central London despite the rain.           While Charles became King on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II last September, the coronation on Saturday was the formal crowning of the monarch.           The service was a profoundly religious affair, reflecting the fact that aside from being head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, Charles is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.           In the most significant moment of the day, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed the 360-year-old St. Edward’s Crown on Charles’ head. The spiritual leader of the Anglican Church then declared: “God Save the King.”     Live: King Charles III is crowned         The intricate service lasted just over two hours – about an hour shorter than Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 – and followed a traditional template that has stayed much the same for more than 1,000 years.           However, it has been modernized in certain key ways.\nHigh credibility of text: Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott, Tucker Reals             Updated on:  May 6, 2023 / 9:07 PM           / CBS News          London — King Charles III and his wife, Queen Camilla, were both formally crowned Saturday in a historic ceremony at London's Westminster Abbey before appearing on the balcony for a flyover.  The coronation ceremony, steeped in centuries of tradition but with a few small tweaks for the modern age, played out in front of about 2,000 invited guests and a global audience of millions watching on TV or livestream. Though Charles officially became king following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Sept. 8, 2022, today's coronation ceremony consecrated and celebrated his ascent to the throne. Follow along below for the latest updates as the ceremony unfolded:  King Charles and Queen Camilla stepped out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace Saturday with other senior members of their family to watch a military fly-past and greet members of the public. They were joined by other \"working\" members of the royal family, including William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children.  As part of the \"slimmed down\" coronation day events requested by the king, not all members of their large family joined them.\n\nQuestion:when did king charles iii get crowned?\nAnswer:"

The show capped its first season Tuesday night, and while \"Monarch\" opened with a strong rating and ranked as Fox's most-watched fall scripted debut in three years, the following 10 episodes didn't perform as well, Deadline reported. The show created by Melissa London Hilfers was ordered in May 2021 and was intended to launch in January 2022. The debut was scuttled to the fall as a result of the pandemic. \"Monarch\" is a multigenerational country music drama about country music's most influential family -- The Romans. The family is led by tough and talented Dottie Cantrell Roman, played by Sarandon, and her husband Albie, Adkins' character. Sarandon dies in the first episode. The Roman's success is at risk, and the family comes together to protect its legacy and future – and all costs. Executive producers for the Fox Entertainment-produced series include Hilfers, Gail Berman, Hend Baghdady, and Nashville power manager Jason Owen. \"Right now, we are all living in a really divided country,\" Owen told People when \"Monarch\" debuted. \"When times are tough, you look for something to sort of give you a break from all the noise.\nHigh credibility of text: The upcoming Fox series boasts strong ties to the real Nashville, including cameos by a host of country stars and a theme song by Music City songwriting royalty  Trace Adkins says he truly met his match when he was offered the role of Albie Roman, the patriarch in Monarch, the much-anticipated Fox primetime drama set in the country music scene.   \"He's very much like me,\" the 60-year-old country hitmaker tells PEOPLE. \"I mean, I can look back over periods in my life where the train was perpetually off the track, and that's Albie's world. The train is perpetually off the track. Sometimes it's his fault, sometimes it's not, but he has to deal with that stuff.\"   Indeed, Adkins has had his share of tabloid headlines over the years — but forgive him for forgetting one more glaringly obvious reason that the part fits him to a T: The singer and his character are both big-time country stars. And obviously, Adkins' casting is just one of the ways the show, which is set in Austin, is sure to bring a country music authenticity to what promises to be one of the fall's hottest — and steamiest — new shows.\nLow credibility of text: Susan Sarandon and Trace Adkins lead the star-studded cast. The new country musical series Monarch hasn't even premiered yet but it's already at the top of our TV watch list! The trailer for the upcoming Fox show is filled with plenty of action and drama—the kind that will definitely appeal to fans of shows like Yellowstone and Nashville. Monarch will make its debut on September 11 so be sure to mark your calendars and maybe even prepare a menu of cowboy food for the big event! In the meantime, as we all await the premiere, let's take some time to get to know the talented actors that make up Monarch's cast. This show is loaded with seasoned Hollywood and country music stars, as well as newcomers offering fresh charisma for the camera. Those who have seen the trailer already know that Oscar-award-winning legend Susan Sarandon and country music singer Trace Adkins will star alongside each other in the upcoming series. But we're providing a little more information on their characters, as well as details about the rest of the cast. (By the way, in addition to these stars, you can also look forward to special appearances from country greats Shania Twain, Martina McBride, Little Big Town, and more!) Who are you most excited to see on  Monarch? Let us know in the comments and make sure you're tuned in and ready to watch in September! Sarandon will take the lead role as country music queen Dottie Roman.\nLow credibility of text: Adkins also said he didn't \"really lean on anybody\" for advice when it came to prepping for the role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has been on \"The Voice\" for years, and Tim recently starred in the \"Yellowstone\" prequel, \"1883.\" \"Blake’s thing is a completely different animal,\" he said. \"You can’t compare that stuff.\" He said he hadn't talked to McGraw, but added: \"Tim’s a good actor, I’ve always respected what he does. I’ve just kind of done my own thing, haven’t had to really lean on anybody too much for a lot of advice.\" Adkins, who isn't a stranger to acting, with previous stints on television and in the recent movies \"Old Henry,\" \"Apache Junction\" and \"Badland,\" said playing Albie, his character on \"Monarch,\" wasn't too big of a stretch. \"He's a no-nonsense kind of guy, and I’m kind of that way too,\" Adkins admitted. \"He’s not very animated, and neither am I. We say what we’ve gotta say, and don’t have to yell it … just kind of move through this life as softly and peacefully as they’ll allow us to, but when they don’t – we'll do what we’ve gotta do.\nLow credibility of text: Adkins has even more acting experience; he said he's drawn to film and TV for the same reason he enjoys recording music. \"When I'm in the studio, it's just such a creative environment that stimulates me, and I just absolutely love it,\" he said. \"Television sets and movie sets are the same way. Everybody is so talented in that environment. I love the creativity, and I like being a part of it.\"   But even with his experience, he admitted, he was initially \"terrified\" to share scenes with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon.   \"And then,\" he said, \"I quickly realized, oh my God, she's so professional and so good that she's gonna carry the scene. So, if you don't throw up on yourself, you'll probably be OK because she's gonna do all the heavy lifting. I just swam in her wake the whole time and had a ball.\"   Monarch premieres on the Fox network at 8 p.m. EDT/7 p.m. CDT on Sept. 11.\n\nQuestion:What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?\nAnswer:"

Released in September 2022, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are Apple's current flagship iPhones, sold alongside the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. Now is not the best time to buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus because new iPhone 15 models will come out in September 2023. Those who prefer to buy at release will want to hold out until the newest models come out later this year.  If you just need an updated phone, don't want to wait, and aren't bothered by not having the latest bells and whistles, the iPhone 14 is an iPhone that will last for many years to come. For many people, the best time to buy is when you need a new device. The iPhone 14 is Apple's smaller iPhone at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 14 Plus offers the same feature set in a 6.7-inch form factor.  We'd encourage anyone looking for the newest technology and the highest-end phone to check out the iPhone 14 Pro or wait for the next-generation iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone 14 offers a good balance between functionality, longevity, and price, but if cost is the major factor for you, Apple also offers the $429 iPhone SE with older technology and the prior-generation iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini with pricing starting at $599.\nLow credibility of text: Apple would retain the iPhone 13 design, keep the notch, and even offer the same processor in its next device. Very little was shared about what would actually change in the base models, just that Apple would abandon the mini size for a \"Max\" or \"Plus\" with a 6.7-inch display. Ultimately, Apple leaned on camera improvements, satellite communications, and crash detection as new tentpole features. Big changes are expected for \"iPhone 15\" too, namely adding a USB-C port, but only time will tell. Both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in blue, purple, midnight, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED. Storage can be configured to 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB.

However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the  iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini.  Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[16][17] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named \"iPhone 14 Plus\", rather than \"iPhone 14 Max\", which was predicted by previous rumors.[18][19]  The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's \"Far Out\" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[20][21]\n\nQuestion:When does the iPhone 14 Plus release?\nAnswer:"

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.\nHigh credibility of text: Susie hopes to become an internet sensation, and make enough money to give her and her mother, now bed-ridden with MS, a more comfortable life. But “Susie Searches” isn’t taking off as hoped, unlike the meditation site hosted by campus hunk Jesse (Alex Wolff). When Jesse suddenly goes missing, Susie seizes the opportunity to solve the mystery and make “Susie Searches” a hit. Cute and colorful, SUSIE SEARCHES is a “girl detective” mystery story in the Nancy Drew mode – until it isn’t. Actor-turned-director Sophie Kargman turns this sunny tale in a wholly unexpected direction. As Susie, Kiersey Clemons is impressive, as the title character finds her way through the plot’s twists. In her feature film directorial debut, Kargman takes the script she co-wrote with William Day Frank and the idea of their short film, and transforms it into a tale you don’t see coming, until it is right upon you.\nLow credibility of text: FILM DETAILS: Title: Susie Searches Director: Sophie Kargman Release Date: July 28, 2023 Running Time: 105 minutes Language:  English Screenwriter: Sophie Kargman Distribution Company: Vertical Entertainment AWFJ Movie of the Week Panel Members: Sandie Angulo Chen, Betsy Bozdech, Jamie Broadnax, Leslie Combemale, Nikki Fowler, Pam Grady, Loren King, Cate Marquis, Jennifer Merin, Nell Minow, Sherin Nicole, Liz Whittemore  Previous #MOTW Selections Other Movies Opening This Week Edited by Jennifer Merin Jennifer Merin  is the Film Critic for Womens eNews and contributes the CINEMA CITIZEN blog for and is managing editor for Women on Film, the online magazine of the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, of which she is President.

So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.\n\nQuestion:Who stars as Susie Wallis in Susie Searches?\nAnswer:"

Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he’d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team’s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars’ eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.\nLow credibility of text: Reddick will join 23XI in 2024. However, Busch has had a frosty relationship with RCR owner Richard Childress during his career. In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.\nLow credibility of text: Busch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. – announced in December 2021 – that it would end its NASCAR sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.\nLow credibility of text: His career average finish is 13.8, and no full-time RCR driver has reached that mark since Ryan Newman in 2015. And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in 2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy to RCR, it will be Busch.\nLow credibility of text: Busch joins a two-car RCR team that has Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick under contract for next season. RCR will presumably expand to three cars to accommodate Busch’s arrival, though the team could negotiate a buyout of Reddick’s contract that has one year remaining after Reddick announced earlier this year that he’s leaving to join 23XI Racing in 2024.

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Titans showrunner Greg Walker previously told EW that when he reached out to actor Titus Welliver about portraying iconic DC supervillain Lex Luthor in season 4, he was surprised to find that Welliver was already well-versed in the comic book history of the Teen Titans.  \"I've been collecting comic books since I was 7 or 8 years old,\" Welliver tells EW. \"I'm 60 now, so that's a lot of comic books.\"  He has the nerd knowledge to prove it, too. Check out EW's conversation with Welliver about Luthor and all things Titans below.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What first got you interested in the Teen Titans?  TITUS WELLIVER: I love the period in the late '60s and the '70s when they're less clean-cut, their hair is longer, they're kind of hip, they're go-go dancing. I had always read the comics. I mean, I have all the omnibuses, plus I still have all of my original collection.  So when somebody calls you up on the phone and says, \"Do you want to play Lex Luthor?\" The immediate answer is yes.\nLow credibility of text: He also played memorable antagonists in Sons of Anarchy and Lost and appeared in The Mandalorian and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Welliver also happens to be a huge comic book fan and didn’t take much convincing to join Titans, showrunner Greg Walker said. \"You usually have to do this whole dog-and-pony show to get an actor to do the show. But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most unexpected call I've ever had.\" As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor’s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.\n\nQuestion:Who was playing Lex Luthor in Titans?\nAnswer:"

Its relationship with U.S. News has been up and down. By Stephanie Saul and Anemona Hartocollis Columbia University announced on Tuesday that its undergraduate schools would no longer participate in the U.S. News & World Report college rankings, the first major university to refuse to supply information to the influential undergraduate guide for students and parents. Columbia said it had become concerned about the “outsized influence” the rankings played in the undergraduate admissions process. “Much is lost in this approach,” the university said in an announcement signed by officials including Mary C. Boyce, Columbia’s provost. Columbia also noted that the expected U.S. Supreme Court decision to end or curtail affirmative action “may well lead to a reassessment of admissions policies in ways we can’t even contemplate at this point.” Columbia’s move comes after it dropped in the rankings released in September — to No. 18 from No. 2 — and after many prestigious law and medical schools, including Columbia’s, decided to boycott the listings by refusing to provide data to U.S. News. Calling the rankings unreliable and unfair, the schools criticized them for skewing educational priorities. On Tuesday, U.S. News defended its ranking system as an important guide for students.\n\nQuestion:What is Columbia University's QS ranking in 2023?\nAnswer:"

That changed Sunday night with Riz Ahmed, a British actor of Pakistani descent, winning an Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for his role in HBO’s “The Night Of.” Before him, only one other South Asian star had taken home an acting award from the ceremony — Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy for her role in “The Good Wife” in 2010. Ahmed’s win was seen as a long-overdue victory for South Asians and his fellow Muslims. His success is significant not only because of his historic win, but because of the character he portrayed: Naz, a nuanced, relatable college student from Queens — who also happens to be Pakistani. While “The Night Of” tackles issues of race and Islamophobia, Naz’s ethnicity and religion are secondary to the story’s main plot. “It’s always strange reaping the rewards of a story that’s based on real world suffering,” Ahmed, who is also an activist and rapper, said in his acceptance speech. “But if this show has shown a light on some of the prejudice in our society, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, then maybe that’s something.\nLow credibility of text: Another tweet called Ahmed a “trailblazer for all Asian and young people, proving it is possible to reach those lofty heights.” So happy for @rizmc and @azizansari tonight!!

In between a black lesbian won Emmy-Its the best of America As reviewers and commentators noted, this year’s Emmys show that Hollywood has made major strides in its inclusion of South Asian Americans. Not long ago, most roles for South Asians were bit parts, and included “terrorists cab drivers and the odd medical professional,” as The Post’s Lavanya Ramanathan wrote last month. “A major metropolitan newspaper once counted Apu from ‘The Simpsons’ as a South Asian role — that’s how bad it was,” Ramanathan wrote. Mindy Kaling’s “The Mindy Project” was the first show written by and starring an Indian American woman. An Indian American comedian, Hasan Minhaj, hosted the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. And “The Big Sick” — whose protagonist, Kumail Nanjiani, is Pakistani American — was a hit film this summer.\nHigh credibility of text: By subscribing, I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The South Korean star of Netflix’s most popular show ever collected the award in person on Sunday night. Lee’s lead performance in the international hit action drama was nominated against Bob Odenkirk for “Better Call Saul,” Adam Scott for “Severance,” Jason Bateman for “Ozark,” and Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong from “Succession” (the latter of which was the 2020 winner for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series). On “Squid Game,” the charismatic actor played the blundering Seong Gi-hun who, after he was unable to pay off all his debts, was kidnapped and manipulated into competing in a competition with real life or death stakes. Last competitor left standing wins a seismic cash prize.

I’m really proud to be from the UK.

Hopefully we’ll see a globalization of our storytelling.\" In a speech to the House of Commons in London earlier this year, the British-Pakistani actor made his case for representation of ethnic minorities in media. \"If we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism,\" he said. \"People are looking for the message that they belong, that they are part of something, that they are seen and heard and that despite, or perhaps because of, their experience, they are valued. They want to feel represented.

Ahmed’s historic win “punctuates the lack of Asian actor winners,” she said. Meanwhile, there were no Asian female acting nominees at this year’s Emmys. “Women were missing again,” Wang Yuen said. “Where were Constance Wu, Lucy Liu and Mindy Kaling?” “Talent is not the problem,” she also said, “but, to paraphrase Viola Davis’s speech from a few years ago, the only thing that separates Asian/American actors from anyone else is opportunity; you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Wang Yuen pioneered a study this year called “Tokens on the Small Screen: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Prime Time and Streaming Television.” Professors and scholars at six California universities surveyed 242 broadcast, cable and digital platform shows that aired during the 2015-2016 season.\n\nQuestion:Who was the first Asian man to win Lead Actor in a Drama Series?\nAnswer:"

Data released Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that inflation landed at 8.3% last month compared to one year ago. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an 8.1% annual increase. Prices increased 8.5% in July.  Excluding volatile food and gas prices, inflation climbed 6.3% year-on-year — higher than the consensus estimate for 6.1% and an increase from last month's 5.9% reading.  The energy index rose 23.8% over the past 12 months. That includes the cost of electricity, which saw its largest one-year increase (15.8%) in four decades, according to the data.  Other categories that saw increases in August include motor vehicle maintenance and repair, up 1.7%; health insurance, up 2.4%; and pets and pet products, up 1.6% in the 30-day period between July and August.

Annualized, these families are facing inflation costs of $11,438, $11,100, and $10,167 over the next year, respectively. For the average American household, inflation costs were essentially unchanged from July to August, decreasing by $2. Seventeen states saw inflation cost increases and 33 states saw inflation cost decreases.

According to Aonuma, the sequel will build atop the original's world with a new story and gameplay elements,[220] and is inspired in part by Red Dead Redemption 2.[221] Fujibayashi will reprise his role as director.[222] Originally set to be released in 2022, the game was delayed to early 2023.[223][224] The game was released on May 12, 2023.[219]\nLow credibility of text: Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details” about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the Wild 2 title has been spreading around online https://t.co/hy4V0WiTX2 pic.twitter.\nLow credibility of text: Written by  Mel Ramsay Posted  30th Mar 2022 11:03 The original Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is universally accepted as one of the best games of all time, with enviable review scores from critics and players alike. So with the sequel on its way (albeit later than we anticipated due to a recently revealed delay), many people are referring to it as Breath of the Wild 2.  However, an insider has now claimed that it won't be called that at all, and instead will be named Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality. Nintendo Life journalist, Paul Gale, shared a blogpost on his own website, claiming that a source close to Nintendo informed him of the name. Apparently, the company wants to capitalise on the fact that the name 'Breath of the Wild' is synonymous with 'amazing game', but they also want to hit home that you can play as more than just Link.  In the post, Gale continued that there was another benefit to the word 'duality', saying: \"...duality between character abilities, on land and floating regions, past and present, darkness and light, etc.\" Sadly, as is the case with these things sometimes, the insider apparently \"did note that this name was seen a considerable amount of time ago and could have been one of many template titles.\" So by now, the name could've changed. Damn.\nLow credibility of text: And it seems the only thing Nintendo has confirmed is more Breath of the Wild 2 delays. If “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality” turns out to be the real name for Breath of the Wild 2, it could confirm a popular fan request. Fans have wanted to play as Princess Zelda for years. Nintendo has almost given players their wishes in games like The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. However, the “Duality” could give gamers the chance to control the titular princess. “If real, it does make sense as to why Nintendo and Mr. Eiji Aonuma have been so hush-hush on the title,” Gale reports. “If fake or not final-yet-close to what the actual name ends up being, this still makes for an interesting topic to discuss.” Nintendo Treehouse’s Bill Trinen told IGN in 2021 why they kept the name so guarded. “As for why we’re holding back on the name, you’ll just have to stay tuned because, obviously, Zelda names are kind of important,” Trinen said. “Those subtitles … they start to give little bits of hints about maybe what’s going to happen.” The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, has an update to share about the launch timing of the sequel to The Legend of #Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), Tears of the Kingdom retains aspects including the open world of Hyrule, which has been expanded to allow for more vertical exploration. The player controls Link as he searches for Princess Zelda and fights to prevent the Demon King from destroying the world.  Tears of the Kingdom was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content (DLC) had exceeded its scope. Its development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division, specifically Production Group Number 3,[1] with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. A teaser was shown at E3 2019 with a full reveal at E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned for release in 2022 before being delayed to May 2023. It received acclaim for its improvements, expanded open world, and features encouraging exploration and experimentation. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of release, and had sold over 18.5 million copies by June 2023.[2]  Tears of the Kingdom retains the open-world action-adventure gameplay of the previous Zelda game, Breath of the Wild (2017).\nHigh credibility of text: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Quick notes on my process:         I am assuming acts that play in Central Texas before May to be in play. There is precedence (albeit a limited one) for acts to play in May and still make it on the bill but 99% of the time, if they play May or later, they are out for ACL.         I will not include any acts that played ACL in the past two years. While I know there are some very limited cases of artists playing twice in a three-year span, it would be overkill to track over 300+ acts when 99% of them are out. Only in very obvious cases will I track a '21 or '22 act.\n\nQuestion:When is ACL 2023 taking place?\nAnswer:"

Royal family members and dignitaries gathered at Westminster Abbey for a somber service. Presidents, prime ministers, princes and princesses, and other public figures sat side-by-side to pay their last respects – a testament to her far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy.            The funeral, which served as both a state and religious service and marked the culmination of 10 days of mourning, honored the Queen with the sort of pageantry that she used to promote the royal family and “brand Britain” throughout her life.           Tens of thousands of people flocked to streets around Westminster Abbey and along the 25-mile procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the sovereign’s flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place.           In the third and last procession of the day, the Queen’s coffin was taken past throngs of well-wishers lining the Long Walk to Windsor Castle for her committal service and burial at St. George’s Chapel, where she was separated from the crown for the final time.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London.

On a day filled with tributes and ceremony, Britain bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II who reigned for more than 70 years. LONDON (AP) — The United Kingdom and the world bade farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a state funeral that drew presidents and kings, princes and prime ministers — and crowds in the streets of London and at Windsor Castle — to honor a monarch whose 70-year reign defined an age. In a country known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill’s was filled with spectacle: Before the service, a bell tolled 96 times — once a minute for each year of Elizabeth’s life. Then, 142 Royal Navy sailors used ropes to draw the gun carriage carrying her flag-draped coffin to Westminster Abbey, where pallbearers carried it inside and about 2,000 people ranging from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn.  The trappings of state and monarchy abounded: The coffin was draped with the Royal Standard and atop it was the Imperial State Crown, sparkling with almost 3,000 diamonds, and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. But the personal was also present: The coffin was followed into the church by generations of Elizabeth’s descendants, including King Charles III, heir to the throne Prince William and 9-year-old George, who is second in line.\n\nQuestion:When is the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II?\nAnswer:"

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.\nHigh credibility of text: On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London.

It's picked up by air traffic control radar so that your plane can be identified by the number, altitude and ground speed. But the technology also lets airplanes communicate among each other. So now the same ping goes off between point or one airplane to the other,\" Feith explained.  Besides that system, Feith believes this is more of a \"see and avoid\" type accident.  \"That is on a beautiful day like this, it is incumbent upon each pilot flying in the airspace to clear the area visually to ensure that things like this don't happen,\" he said.  Feith adds that the airspace around where this crash may have happened, is known to have high air traffic, especially since it's known as a \"training box.\" \"So you have a lot of airplanes operating in a band of airspace or a box of airspace.\nLow credibility of text: And if there are pilots that are training but transient aircraft coming through that area, of course, it's incumbent upon all pilots to make a number of radio calls in the blind so that you can alert other pilots who may be in the near vicinity to where you are, what you're doing, what altitude you're operating at.,\" Feith explained.  While it's still unclear what exactly led up to this crash, Feith notes that the recent pilot shortage has generally increased the number of people going to flight schools. \"Right now, because pilot training has escalated ten-fold because of the pilot shortage in the airlines,\" he said.  In any case, Feith says there will also be environmental factors to be looked at too.  \"So they're going to be looking at sun angles - were the pilots flying in to - in a direction that may have given them sun glare so they really couldn't see,\" he said. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash. NTSB said that a preliminary report will be released in about 15 days. The full investigation, however, can take more than a year.

Aerial footage showed that one of the aircraft had landed in trees, while the other crashed into a nearby field. Two people were on board the Cessna 172, the FAA said. The sheriff's office also said it confirmed two people were on board the plane, both of whom were found dead at the scene. The sheriff's office said at this time one person was confirmed to be in the aircraft, who was also found dead at the scene. The FAA said it is unknown how many people were on board the second aircraft. The victims have yet to be identified, the sheriff's office said. Once identified, their names will be released pending next-of-kin notification. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash.\nLow credibility of text: The roads near the crash sites will be closed amid the investigation, according to the Mount View Fire Department, which asked people to avoid the area.\n\nQuestion:How many people died in the mid-air collision in Boulder County?\nAnswer:"

As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]\nLow credibility of text: 30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]\nLow credibility of text: He succeeded in being elected by obtaining 116 votes out of 206 in the first round thanks to the support from opposition parties to the centre-right coalition.[117][118][119] Tensions further grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as \"patronising, overbearing, arrogant ... [and] offensive\" in a series of written notes in the Senate.[120][121] In the following days, after meetings between parties' leader, tensions loosened and the centre-right coalition parties reached an agreement on the formation of the new cabinet.[122]  On 20 October, consultations between President Sergio Mattarella and parties officially began. On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy–Us Moderates–MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]\nHigh credibility of text: Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy’s first female prime minister, becoming the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.           She received the mandate to form a government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.\nLow credibility of text: The possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.\n\nQuestion:Who is Italy's first female prime minister?\nAnswer:"

Uncapped James, 18, has played for England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0 Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty. \"He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,\" Conte told Sky Sports.  \"It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the international break because, with the national team, he is not available.  \"But I think after the international break, he will be available for us.\" Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.\nLow credibility of text: Ryan Giggs, the Wales manager, has challenged his team to prove their strength in depth by winning in the Republic of Ireland without Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Giggs explained that Bale will miss the match because of “a bit of fatigue” but will probably be fit enough to play for Real Madrid on Saturday. Ramsey, meanwhile, is unavailable after becoming the father of twins on Sunday. Wales will also be without the injured teenager Ethan Ampadu, who controlled midfield when Wales thrashed Ireland 4-1 in Cardiff last month. Victory in Dublin would take Wales above Denmark to the top of their Nations League group while defeat would put them bottom. Wales have won only three competitive matches without Bale since he made his international debut in 2006. “We have to cope, prove people wrong, make that record better,” said Giggs. “It’s not going to be easy but we’ve still got players who can make things happen.” Ben Davies, the left-back, struck a similar note. “These are the games where we have to adapt and show what we’re about. We’ve got a lot of young quality coming through and we’ve got to show what we can do.” The absences could lead to a start for Harry Wilson, a 21-year-old on loan at Derby County from Liverpool.\nLow credibility of text: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Made an important block to spare Neco Williams' blushes as he reacted superbly well to thwart Oleksandr Karavaev in the first half.

Played Yaremchuk onside for an early chance and was grateful to Hennessey. Made a vital headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Indeed, it was as if Ampadu's head was a magnet to the ball. Wales warmed to their task from the moment Williams cut inside and fizzed a sighter wide. Switched off at the far post to nearly let Karavaev in but combined well with Daniel James going forward. Bristled with confidence at the start of the second period and stuck to his guns. Growing in maturity with each passing cap.\nLow credibility of text: But he has quickly established himself as one of Swansea's key players having returned to the club after leaving Stoke City at the end of last season. Davies' absence and the loss of Allen are further blows to Wales manager Page, who is already planning to be without forward Gareth Bale to face Belgium. Wales are also without injured midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson, plus goalkeeper Adam Davies. Wales' World Cup campaign begins against the USA on 21 November. James has made 10 appearances for Birmingham this season and has previously represented Wales at Under 18 level. Born in Hereford, he qualifies for Wales via his father, former Newport County defender Tony. who also played for Hereford. Wales sit bottom of League A Group 4 with one draw from four games, with results not helped by Page having to field largely second-string sides in two of those games as he prepared for what would turn out to be a historic World Cup play-off victory over Ukraine. But that leaves Wales needing at least one win from these two fixtures if they are to remain in the top tier of the Nations League.

This was Las Vegas's third time making the finals, and the second time since moving to Vegas. They previously competed in the Finals in 2008 and 2020. This was Connecticut's fourth time making the finals. They previously competed in 2004, 2005, and 2019.[2]  The Aces won the finals three games to one to claim their first championship in franchise history.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.\nLow credibility of text: Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.\nHigh credibility of text: Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive show news, updates, and more!

Instead, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel Watch 2 will make its debut in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Again, there’s no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model arrives.\nHigh credibility of text: The Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nLow credibility of text: You can read our full Pixel Watch review for all of our in-depth analysis, but the overall takeaway is that we were left with an expectation that Google is just getting started. We fully expect to see a Pixel Watch 2 in the not-to-distant future. For starters, the lineup stands out among Wear OS-based wearables with a streamlined, Google-centric user experience and unique Fitbit integration. As such, it’s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit’s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features. Respected leaker Evan Blass tweeted an image containing the words “Pixel Watch 2” on May 9. It’s unclear if this image was derived from an official source. Nevertheless, this is as close as we’ve gotten to a Pixel Watch 2 confirmation given Blass’s reliability. Check out the image below. A report from 9to5Google in late May that details some of the Pixel Watch 2’s specs also appears to confirm that Google is working on a sequel to its smartwatch. In another report from the outlet, an APK teardown appears to have revealed a new codename, “eos.” Prior to this information, a leak revealed the codename “aurora.\nLow credibility of text: 17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\n\nQuestion:What is the release date of the Pixel Watch?\nAnswer:"

The 67-year-old Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions, officials said. A hearse carrying Abe’s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his home in Tokyo. Abe’s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was obviously homemade — about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long — and they confiscated similar weapons and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.\nLow credibility of text: [307][317][318] Yamagami said he resented the fact that his mother was brain-washed by the religious group, and had gone bankrupt as a result.[319][320] Yamagami had been trying to kill Hak Ja Han of the Unification Church since around 2002, but he gave up because he could not get close to her, changing his target to Abe.[321] Yamagami said that he \"didn't have a grudge against Abe's political beliefs\", but instead that he killed Abe because he believed the former prime minister had spread the religion to Japan.[319][320] Abe and his family were known to have long-standing ties to the Unification Church, dating back to his grandfather Kishi Nobusuke; Abe himself had held speeches in support of the religious movement.[322][323] According to research by Nikkan Gendai, 10 out of 20 members in the Fourth Abe Cabinet had connections to the Unification Church.[324]  In response to the shooting and his subsequent death, numerous present and former world leaders expressed their sympathies and support for Abe.[325][326] His body was returned to Tokyo the day after his assassination and his funeral took place on 27 September 2022.[327][328]  Some have described Abe as a right-wing Japanese nationalist.\nLow credibility of text: 82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old.

The assassination of the former world leader in broad daylight has shocked a nation not used to gun violence and prompted an outpouring of support and condolences from the international community.            Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on Friday. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was “deep enough to reach his heart” and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding.           Abe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart.            The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, was detained at the scene and admitted to shooting Abe, according to Nara Nishi police.

Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.\nLow credibility of text: 66][70][71] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area.[72][73][74] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed.

Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun.

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.\nHigh credibility of text: The state funeral of Shinzo Abe, former prime minister of Japan and serving member of the House of Representatives who was assassinated on 8 July 2022, was attended by roughly 3,600 people within Japan alone and by around 700 international attendees.[1] The funeral was held on 27 September 2022 at the Nippon Budokan venue in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Out of the foreign attendees, 49 top-level foreign leaders and 218 foreign delegates, including 101 ambassadors and representatives based in Japan, were present at the state funeral.[2]\nLow credibility of text: (Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP)                                                           TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan’s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.\nLow credibility of text: Public anger at  cost of  ceremony for former PM and revelations over his party’s ties to religious group A state funeral for Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been held in Tokyo amid public anger over the cost of the ceremony and revelations over his party’s ties to a controversial religious group. More than 4,000 guests, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, stood in silence as a member of Japan’s self-defence forces entered the Nippon Budokan hall, where a 19-gun salute sounded in honour of the assassinated former leader. Abe’s widow, Akie, dressed in a black kimono, carried her late husband’s ashes into the hall, followed by Japan’s crown prince, Akishino, and other members of the imperial family. Abe was killed in early July by a man armed with a homemade gun who has reportedly told police that he had targeted the conservative politician over his support for the Unification church. Amid tight security, people opposed to the funeral demonstrated as thousands of mourners queued to lay flowers and offer prayers in a park near the venue. After a video showcasing Abe’s achievements, set to footage of the former prime minister playing the piano, the current leader, Fumio Kishida, paid tribute to his friend and predecessor.\n\nQuestion:when was the State funeral of Shinzo Abe\nAnswer:"

A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.\nLow credibility of text: House of the Dragon. Photograph by Ollie Upton / HBO We’ve rounded the halfway point on House of the Dragon season 1, HBO’s much-hyped Game of Thrones prequel series. House of the Dragon will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes. In addition, Rotten Tomatoes‘ series page for the show has episode titles listed. We’re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the Rotten Tomatoes episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6. While the episode titles aren’t confirmed by HBO, it’s still enough to get us pretty excited. “The Lord of the Tides” refers to the head of House Velaryon; why will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season? Then there’s “The Green Council.\nHigh credibility of text: Den of Geek    Ad New actors, new dragons, and new drama keep House of the Dragon fresh after a 10-year time jump. This House of the Dragon review contains spoilers. “The Princess and the Queen” is effectively a second pilot episode for House of the Dragon. The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that’s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon’s respective broods of children.  The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you’re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn’t work. And yet, work “The Princess and The Queen” does. This episode isn’t just an impressive technical maneuver. It’s by far the most entertaining and enriching dispatch from House of the Dragon yet.  The fresh burst of energy that “The Princess and The Queen” provides to House of the Dragon is evident from its very first scene.\nLow credibility of text: The teaser also features the queen and the princess’ latest spat, with tempers flaring so much that Alicent publicly pulls a knife on Rhaenyra. Now that the pivotal sixth episode has made its way to air, we’re officially in the back stretch of the season. House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon’s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, “Driftmark,” which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who’ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter’s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark. As we’ve seen in the trailer, viewers will see the funeral for Laena.\nLow credibility of text: Also, don't get in their way, because this is one couple that'll stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) began as Rhaenyra's protector, then killed her husband's lover at her wedding, and now he may be on the side of Queen Alicent, who talked him out of killing himself in the Godswood at the end of episode 5. He's seen fighting Ser Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr), aka Harwin Breakbones, noted for his strength. If Ser Harwin is now Rhaenyra's protector, this could be essentially an Alicent-Rhaenyra proxy fight right here. Stay tuned. Episode 6 of House of the Dragon will air on Sept. 25 on HBO Max.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of House of the Dragon's sixth episode?\nAnswer:"

With its razor-sharp script, schooldays nostalgia and genius characters, it’s certainly a series to binge.

Watch the latest shows and sport from Sky with a NOW Membership, Netflix, and Discovery+ all in one place. Derry Girls season 3 starts on Tuesday, April 12th, 2022 on Channel 4. Catch up on All 4. New episodes are released weekly. Season 3 releases new episodes every Tuesday at 9.15pm on Channel 4. The final season will have six episodes. The Derry Girls season 3 finale will air on Tuesday 17 May at 9.15pm on Channel 4. It's been confirmed that a special one-off episode will will air in the same week as the finale, although Channel 4 hasn't announced a specific release date for it yet.\nHigh credibility of text: After proudly declaring himself a “Derry Girl” and bringing everyone to tears (it’s OK if you cried too), he decided to remain in Derry with his friends. Good news for everyone, because the trailer picks up right where we last left them.

Check out some photos below. Clare Devlin (Nicola Coughlan) is having a plaid moment.\nLow credibility of text: It's been over three years since fans of the hilarious sitcom Derry Girls saw Erin (played by Saoirse-Monica Jackson), Orla (Louisa Harland), Clare (Nicola Coughlan), Michelle (Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), and James (Dylan Llewellyn) get up to some serious mischief. Thankfully, Derry Girls Season 3 is almost here. However, the long-anticipated wait for Season 3 is bittersweet as the latest series marks the end of the Derry Girls story. Lucky fans in the U.K. and Ireland will have access to the new series before the rest of the world, with the third and final season premiering on Tuesday, April 12 at 9.15 p.m. on Channel 4 and episodes airing every Tuesday thereafter. So, when exactly will Season 3 of Derry Girls land on Netflix? Newsweek has everything you need to know. Just like the first two seasons of Derry Girls, Season 3 will be coming to Netflix for fans to enjoy. Unfortunately, fans in the U.S. will be waiting a little longer for the final season to drop. The good news is, unlike viewers in the U.K., who will have to wait for every Tuesday at 9.15 p.m. for episodes to drop, all six episodes will be available in one go for fans to binge-watch.\nLow credibility of text: At the moment, an official Netflix release date for Derry Girls Season 3 has not been confirmed, but judging by previous release patterns, Derry Girls could hopefully be heading to Netflix in the summer. In the past, Derry Girls has landed on the global streaming platform after all episodes of Derry Girls have finished airing on Channel 4 and All4. This means Derry Girls could land in June 2022 at the earliest or at some point this summer. Fingers crossed it will not be too long a wait. Derry Girls will be sticking to its roots in the third and final Season 3, which means, yes, more drama and mischief from Erin, her cousin Orla and their friends Clare, Michelle, and English James as they come of age during the Troubles in Derry while juggling school at Our Lady Immaculate College., romance, relationships and the chaos of the 1990s. Season 3 will see the gang waiting for their exam results but, as teased in the trailer, fans can expect to see a lot of the usual mess the Derry Girls find themselves in. The official synopsis per Channel 4 teases: \"While Northern Ireland is growing up, this gang of eejits certainly aren't any time soon - there's hope in the air that The Troubles may finally be over, but their troubles are only just getting started as they get ever closer to 'adulthood'.\nLow credibility of text: 23][24] Production of the third series was due to commence in the spring of 2020, but was suspended following the announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown.[25] On 21 July 2021, Nicola Coughlan confirmed that filming for the third series was set to commence in late 2021, with a premiere in early 2022.[26] On 23 September 2021, series creator and writer Lisa McGee confirmed Derry Girls would end with its third series, stating \"it was always the plan to say goodbye after three series.\"[27] On 21 December 2021, McGee and Coughlan announced on social media that filming of the final series had completed.[28]  The first series premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on Thursday nights at 10:00 pm, while the second series was moved to Tuesday nights at 9:15 pm, with the exception of the sixth episode, which was aired at 9:00 pm.

The appointment of Collier as Fox’s entertainment chief executive officer surprised the industry — even some internal Fox staffers, who had expected to see Gary Newman oversee the network’s transition into a standalone entity once 21st Century Fox’s merger with The Walt Disney Company was complete. Newman has been atop the Fox network as Fox TV Group chairman with Dana Walden since 2014, and has run 20th Century Fox TV with Walden since 1999.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still available.\nLow credibility of text: 4s adrift of his teammate at Suzuka and behind both Ferraris was poor, as was coming home nearly half a minute down on Verstappen having failed to pass a slower race-pace car on badly worn tyres. Perez and his fans are right to point out that he's now second in the 2022 standings and has earned Red Bull's trust in doing what Gasly and Alex Albon couldn't in picking up the pieces if Verstappen isn't around to hold them. Plus, his defence/attack against Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and Leclerc last weekend helped seal Verstappen's two titles. This is all to his credit. But the picture is only rosy if Red Bull keeps winning easily. If another team/driver combo in the future produces a stiffer challenge than Ferrari/Leclerc in 2022, then the unbalanced Red Bull line-up will be exposed. With four dead rubbers now to come, Perez should focus on closing the performance gap to Verstappen, which is particularly prevalent on the purpose-built facilities that make up the bulk of the calendar, and on building momentum for 2023.

Warner Bros., New Line Cinemas, DC, they have been so incredibly supportive over the years,\" Johnson continued. \"In 2008 was when we first started talking about this. So, it has required patience by all of us as partners.\nLow credibility of text: Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.\nHigh credibility of text: In the upcoming Dwayne Johnson flick, Black Adam, the character of Adrianna Tomaz is played by actress Sarah Shahi. Tomaz, aka Isis, was a refugee Black Adam received as a bribe from Intergang. Tomaz plays a pivotal role in Black Adam's evolution as a character. Sarah Shahi is a noted actress who's appeared in several popular TV shows and films over the years.  Instagram Post Sarah Shahi was born on January 10, 1980, to Abbas Jahansouzshahi and Mahmonir Soroushazar. Shahi has Iranian ancestry from her paternal and maternal sides. While her father and paternal grandfather are Iranian, her maternal grandmother is Spanish. Shahi was born Aahoo Jahansouzshahi but later changed her name to Sarah Shahi. As a child, Shahi was interested in sports and participated in beauty pageants. She majored in English and Theater at the Southern Methodist University in New Mexico. Sarah Shahi met legendary American director Robert Altman early in her career and worked on his film, Dr. T & the Women. She subsequently went on to star in Dawson's Creek, Supernatural, Alias, and The L Word. In 2007, she played a minor role in HBO's iconic gangster series, The Sopranos. That same year, she landed her first lead role on television in Facing Kate, aka Fairly Legal.\n\nQuestion:who played Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam?\nAnswer:"

The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother, will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.\nLow credibility of text: Aiding him throughout his leaps is Addison (Caitlin Bassett), who appears in the form of a hologram only Ben can see and hear. A decorated Army veteran who brings level-headed precision to her job, Ben will need her as he leaps from person to person. At the helm of the highly confidential operation is Herbert “Magic” Williams (Ernie Hudson), a no-nonsense career military man who has to answer to his bosses, who won’t be happy once they learn about the breach of protocol. The rest of the team at headquarters includes Ian Wright (Mason Alexander Park), who runs the Artificial Intelligence unit “Ziggy,” and Jenn Chou (Nanrisa Lee), who heads up digital security for the project. As Ben leaps from life to life, putting right what once went wrong, it becomes clear that he and the team are on a thrilling journey. However, Addison, Magic, Ian and Jenn know that if they are going to solve the mystery of Ben’s leap and bring him home, they must act fast or lose him forever.  Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett and Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci, the original Quantum Leap ran for five seasons between 1989 and 1993.\nLow credibility of text: Martin Gero, Deborah Pratt, and Quantum Leap creator Don Bellisario are also executive producing the revival. The Quantum Leap revival will at least have a pilot episode before NBC makes decision about whether to order a new series. Are you looking forward to seeing Lee in the new Quantum Leap?

Bassett described her character as \"ex-military, ex-intelligence,\" who is brought into the fold by seasoned QL member, Herbert \"Magic\" Williams (Ernie Hudson). \"Now that things have gone a little sideways — or ‘a little caca’ to steal from the original series — her job is keeping this alive; taking care of Ben, figuring this out, trying to bring him home,\" the actress continued. \"She’s on a mission ... she’s there to get our leader home.

Good thing too because it's starting at $100 more than its predecessor. Inside of the RTX 4090, NVIDIA has managed to fit 16,384 CUDA Cores clocked at a base speed of 2.23GHz.    Alongside the 4090, NVIDIA will offer two different variants of the RTX 4080. The base model, starting at $899, features 12GB of GDDR6X memory, while the 16GB version will set you back a cool $1,199. Both configurations will arrive sometime in November. However, NVIDIA will only sell a Founders Edition model of the more expensive model. For the 12GB version, you'll need to look to the company's partners, which may make it hard to find models that actually start at $899.  Subscribe to the Engadget Deals NewsletterGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget’s editorial team.

Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.\nHigh credibility of text: The RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn’t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you’ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC’d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you’re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS. However, months after launch, prices for board partner GPUs are beginning to ease toward MSRP. Despite this, it’s still priced lower than we initially expected, as a Vietnamese retailer listed the new GPU for over $2000. However, it’s thankfully lower.\nLow credibility of text: The RTX 4090 also possesses a higher MSRP than the RTX 3090, which was launched at $1499. This bump of $100 is actually fairly good pricing, considering inflation in the subsequent years, too.  It’s tough to tell what demand might look like for the RTX 4090, but since it will retain Nvidia’s power crown, and will potentially be one of the best graphics cards in 2023. The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.  Due to an oversupply, Nvidia has cut the price of current-generation high-end graphics cards, and the newer RTX 40-series GPUs are priced slightly higher.  The RTX 4090 manages to boast incredibly impressive specifications on paper, with even more impressive results in gaming scenarios like in Overwatch 2. We’ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You’ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia’s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM. Nvidia released further information on performance that you can expect out of Overwatch 2 using the GPU, we’ve listed their results below.\nLow credibility of text: Both RTX 4080 configurations will be available in November, with prices starting at $1,199 and $899, respectively.

Sports biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of Sweetwater reads: \"The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.\nHigh credibility of text: When New York Knicks executive Ned Irish and Knicks coach Joe Lapchick decide it is time for the Knicks to integrate, with the support of NBA President Maurice Podoloff, they come together with the other team owners of the league to make history.\" With Clifton as the subject, the film is likely to not just tackle his story, but themes of discrimination and a struggle for acceptance, with the decision to focus on this period of his life an apt one.

As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd.

The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.  There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8. Speaking of Apple, these Pixel Watches lack any sort of iPhone compatibility. Google's taking a page from Apple and limiting the Pixel Watch for use with Android phones only.

See our ethics statement. I was cautiously optimistic — dare I say, excited? — following my hands-on with the Pixel Watch last week. While I hadn’t been impressed with the dozens of leaks and official renders, the $349.99 ($399.99 for LTE) Pixel Watch left a much stronger impression in person. That, and the bar for the Pixel Watch is low. This watch’s one job is to not suck. But after a week of testing, it’s fair to say I’ve tempered my expectations. The Pixel Watch is a good first attempt from Google, but the company has a lot of growing pains to work out for the next iteration of the watch. That is, assuming it doesn’t prematurely kill it off.  From the curved glass to the digital crown, Google isn’t shy that it took its design cues for the Pixel Watch from Apple. It’s a smart move, actually.

Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nLow credibility of text: 65] Nicole Nguyen of The Wall Street Journal did not find the smartwatch particularly astounding and noted several software bugs, but ultimately deemed it a worthy companion to the Pixel phone.[66]  Analyst firm Canalys calculated that Google shipped an estimated 880,000 Pixel Watches during the fourth quarter of 2022, constituting 22 percent of Google's total wearable sales, which include Fitbit products. The Pixel Watch's launch allowed Google to obtain 8 percent of the wearable market share, jumping 16 percent from fourth place to second place, behind Apple.[67] The Pixel Watch Android app had amassed more than 500,000 downloads by February 2023.[68]  In May 2023, it was reported that Google was aiming to launch a second-generation Pixel Watch later that year, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.[69]\n\nQuestion:When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?\nAnswer:"

And Hidden Heroes started doing it 10 years ago, and it is the key operative motor.”  Tom Hanks Hanks is best known as an actor and director, creating feel-good masterpieces like Big, Toy Story, and That Thing You Do, but also for creating historical epics that chart the stories of our men and women at war, like Saving Private Ryan or the HBO series “Band of Brothers.” Maybe this fascination with the Greatest Generation is what led to his work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and supporting military caregivers as the chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign. Hanks has been candid in saying that it’s way more simple, when Elizabeth Dole asks for your help, you don’t say no.  Senator Elizabeth Dole “You can never fail when you follow the example of Elizabeth Dole” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the foundation, summing up the resolve of the former Senator, Executive, and Cabinet Secretary who has left such an indelible mark on the United States.\nLow credibility of text: We should make her work at night as well.” Hanks later highlighted Savannah's efforts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to inform struggling caregivers about the resources that were available to them. “Perhaps, where her commitment shines the most, is during the many, many, many personal conversations she shares with caregivers out of view of the cameras and I’ve seen that happen dozens of times,” Hanks noted. “With incredible grace and earnest spirit, she assures them that they will not endure their journey alone.” While accepting her award, Savannah shined a light on the real stars of the night — the military caregivers who Savannah called a depiction of “courage, determination, duty, faith and hope.” “Every person here tonight, every caregiver and veteran at home, you are showing the world what love looks like, what love acts like, what love gives and what love sacrifices,” she said. “It is love of country that calls our service-members to duty. And it is love that propels mothers and fathers, spouses, siblings, children — to hold them and care for them when they return, with wounds seen, and unseen.” Savannah called out by name specific caregivers she's encountered, like Colleen Rose, who nursed her husband through devastating burn injuries, and Pat Ochan, who cares for her husband and raises their son all while juggling her job and pursuing a Ph.D.\nHigh credibility of text: Washington, DC (October 12, 2022)—The Elizabeth Dole Foundation announced Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of TODAY at NBC News, as the 2022 Tom Hanks Caregiver Champion Award recipient in recognition of her outstanding support of military caregivers. The award will be presented at the Foundation’s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on October 19 at The Anthem in Washington, DC and streamed live. The event is the Foundation’s annual tribute to America’s 5.5 million military caregivers, the loved ones who voluntarily care for wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans at home. Senator Elizabeth Dole will be joined by Hidden Heroes Campaign Chair Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion Award was named for Tom Hanks in recognition of his outstanding support of military caregivers. The award has previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama; music superstar Tim McGraw; and actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise. Guthrie was selected in recognition of her devoted advocacy of those who serve and their families. Since joining the Foundation as a Hidden Heroes Ambassador in 2018, Guthrie has used her national platform to bring awareness to the 5.5 million loved ones caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member at home. “We are thrilled to honor our champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.\nLow credibility of text: “We are thrilled to honor our champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, in a news release. “Over the past four years, she has become deeply invested in our cause. She has brought our caregivers’ stories of service and sacrifice into millions of homes across America. And she has gone above and beyond, with such grace and compassion, to speak directly to military caregivers and ensure them that they are not alone.” Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers.\nLow credibility of text: Savannah also gave a nod to her own sister-in-law, Kristine, who raised a family while Savannah's brother served 27 years as an F16 pilot.  “Caregivers prove day in and day out, love isn’t just something you feel, it is something you do,” she added. “You inspire me. You make me want to live up to your example. You are my heroes.” Alex Portée is a senior trending reporter at TODAY Digital and is based in Los Angeles.\n\nQuestion:Who is the recipient of the 2022 Tom Hanks Caregiver Champion Award?\nAnswer:"

I’ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and leadership. I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving, 35-years-young organization. During this time we’ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding from the challenges of the pandemic through our Re:New Prospect Park initiative; restoring the Flatbush Avenue perimeter and creating the first new entrances of the park since the 1940s; revitalizing and expanding the park’s woodlands and natural areas; bringing back to the public the exquisitely restored Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion; and securing funds for our next great phase of restoration, the 26-acre Vale in the park’s northeast corner.\nHigh credibility of text: On February 4, Mayor Eric Adams announced that Prospect Park… October 17, 2022 Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime New York City public servant Morgan Monaco will become the new President of the Alliance, the non-profit that operates the park in partnership with the City, and also the Prospect Park Administrator, a public appointment by NYC Parks.  Monaco, whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most especially park users to help shape her vision for the park’s future. Coming out of the pandemic and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park.

Foderaro The Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit group that raises money for and oversees the daily operation of Brooklyn’s most visited park, has appointed a former New York City parks official as its new president. Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left to lead the city’s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue lives a block from the park. “With three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,” said Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance’s board on Tuesday evening. “It’s our backyard and front yard.” The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration projects. Last year, the park unveiled the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a $74 million project that includes two skating rinks; the southeast corner of the park was also restored and redesigned. Like the leaders of several major park conservancies, Ms. Donoghue, 49, will serve as both the alliance’s president and the park’s official administrator for the parks department.\n\nQuestion:Who is the president of the Prospect Park Alliance?\nAnswer:"

Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn’t lose subs. According to Tuesday’s shareholder letter, executives at Netflix believe they’ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10 per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion. Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19, Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.\nLow credibility of text: 6% in the past year, more than triple the S&P's 19.3% decline as of Oct. 16.   Netflix posted robust annual EPS growth during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 as millions of customers worldwide sheltered at home and turned to streaming entertainment services. On a quarterly basis, profit growth began to decelerate during that period, slowing to 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and declining 5.9% in this year's first quarter.   Netflix's revenue grew by at least 20% annually between 2018 and 2020 and dropped to 8.6% in this year's second quarter. Growth in Q3 FY 2022 is expected to be 4.7%, the slowest of any period since at least the first quarter of 2016.

Streaming memberships have long been Netflix's primary source of revenue. Video streaming has become increasingly competitive in recent years, and Netflix now faces threats from rivals such as Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Apple TV+, Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) Disney+, Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Amazon Prime Video, and AT&T Inc.'s (T) HBO Max.\nLow credibility of text: In the third quarter of 2022, the total revenue and net profit of Netflix decreased marginally by 1% and 3%, respectively, over that in the second quarter of 2022, according to GlobalData.  During the third quarter of 2022, Asia-Pacific accounted for 1.43 million additional customers of Netflix, which constituted the majority of the company's net subscriber increase. With just 100,000 net customers added, the Netflix area of the US and Canada experienced the slowest growth. From the fourth quarter of 2022, Netflix will stop providing guidance for paid memberships but will still reveal those figures when it releases its quarterly earnings.   United States of America United States of America United States of America United States of America Germany United States of America United States of America United States of America United States of America United States of America Don’t wait - discover a universe of connected data & insights with your next search.

We were able to snag up an official teaser description for one of episode 4’s main storylines via NBC’s official episode 4 press release. So, we’re going to certainly take a look at it right now. Let’s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it, “DONDE VIVES.” It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic, interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a rookie officer will be the main focus of this storyline that NBC chose to serve up on a platter. Yep, it turns out that some major scandal will loom in this episode as very startling murder will take place at some point.\nLow credibility of text: The tenth season of the American police procedural television series Chicago P.D. premiered on September 21, 2022, on NBC, for the 2022–23 television season. The season concluded on May 24, 2023. The season contained 22 episodes.   Chicago P.D. revolves around the members of the Intelligence Unit of the 21st District of the Chicago Police Department. The season stars Jason Beghe, Jesse Lee Soffer, Tracy Spiridakos, Marina Squerciati, Patrick John Flueger, LaRoyce Hawkins, Benjamin Levy Aguilar, and Amy Morton. Aguilar joined the series prior to the season premiere, after guest-starring in an episode of the previous season, while Soffer departed the series following the third episode. This season also includes the 200th episode of the series.  Jason Beghe who plays Hank Voight is now credited as an Executive Producer.  The team investigates a string of brutal pharmacy robberies and after Halstead gets into a fight with a suspect, stabbing the man to death, he chooses to turn himself into Chief Patrick O'Neal rather than go along with the cover story Voight and Upton had composed. Halstead later resigns from the Chicago PD, turns in his badge and announces he's returning to the Army to become the leader of a squad designed to track down the worst drug cartel targets, a position that will see him traveling to Bolivia.\nLow credibility of text: It put Hailey in this complicated and dark headspace and also she’s so avoiding everything that’s going on in her life and her emotions and just locking in on this other thing.\" However, Sigan reveals that once the series returns on January 4, reality will come crashing down on Upton.

We really see what that home life is like now that he’s not there. And also it’s just this big open question of: What does it mean for her and what does it mean for her marriage?

YouTube made the announcement in an email to subscribers of the family tier in the US. The change has taken effect immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers were given a 30-day notice. The email to subscribers read: We created YouTube Premium to provide an uninterrupted YouTube experience, so you can get closer to the videos, creators, and music artists that you love. To continue delivering great service and features, we will be increasing your Premium family plan price from $17.99/month to $22.99/month. This change will take place on your next billing cycle starting on or after November 21, 2022. To check the status of your account and billing information, go to your Settings > Purchases and Memberships page. All members have the flexibility to pause or cancel anytime here. Reports say similar price changes are being rolled out in other markets like Canada where prices were increased to CAD $22.99 ($16.82) from CAD $17.99, and in the UK where prices were hiked to £19.99 ($22.64) per month from £17.99. With YouTube Premium, subscribers are able to watch videos on YouTube without ads and download videos and playlists on their mobile device to watch offline.\nLow credibility of text: But you’ll essentially be tossing your complaints into the void, as the company outright says that “you will not receive a response.” The company did switch off a divisive experiment locking 4K videos behind a Premium subscription, but I have a feeling this family plan price increase is here to stay.  “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our members,” YouTube spokesperson Marni Greenberg said in a statement. “This new price reflects the complete value of YouTube Premium and will allow us to develop even more Premium features and continue to support the creators and artists our members watch and listen to on YouTube.” The cost of an individual YouTube Premium plan remains unchanged at $11.99 per month. YouTube doesn’t have anything to share today about changes to other plans, Greenberg said, but noted that the company will notify users by email at least 30 days in advance before changing the price.

It’s a solid service that was an incredible value at $15 for a family or $8 as an individual. You tell me if it is now.\nLow credibility of text: Paying subscribers are also able to continue playing videos on their mobile devices while using other apps or when the screen is off, which is ideal for users that stream music on YouTube. They can also get access to YouTube Music Premium, and listen to music on Google Home or Chromecast Audio. For the YouTube Premium Family Plan, users can share a membership with up to five other family members who live in the same residential address. The plan requires one primary account holder to serve as the family manager. The other family members can use their own Google account to access a shared YouTube paid membership. Family groups share access to YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium and other Google services. Spotify’s family tier, where up to six family members can access Premium account features, costs $15.99 a month in the US. For Apple Music, the family plan costs $19.95 per month. Over a month ago, YouTube’s Global Head of Music, Lyor Cohen, said the company aims to overtake Spotify as the music rights industry’s biggest partner by 2025. “That’s why YouTube is monetizing all music formats (short & long form video, audio tracks, Live, etc.), on all platforms (desktop, tablet, mobile, and TV), in over 100 countries. And overall watch time of music content on YouTube across desktop, tablet, mobile, and TV continues to grow year over year,” Cohen said in a blog post in September.\nHigh credibility of text: If you subscribe to a YouTube Premium family plan, you may want to check your email: Google is notifying users that the monthly cost of the service will be going up by $5 a month. Starting in November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium — though there seems to be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to their status as a \"long-standing and valued member.\" With the new price structure, the family plan is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone screen off. At least you still don't need to subscribe to Premium to watch videos in 4K.\n\nQuestion:How much does the YouTube Premium family plan cost now?\nAnswer:"

In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\".\nLow credibility of text: For Horizon, we think we are on track to release this holiday season.

Taking to Twitter, Judge stated “Ragnarok was delayed because of me” and explained that in 2019 he faced significant health issues leaving him unable to walk. The illness required “back surgery, both hips replaced, and knee surgery” as well as rehab, which Sony Santa Monica waited for him to recover from. Judge added that he received “nothing but love and support” from Sony Santa Monica, who “never said a word about the delay, and what caused it.” Grace Orlady, the senior manager of Santa Monica Studio, has already teased some key details about what we can expect from the game when it launches in a PlayStation Blog post. “As you can see in the trailer, we’re picking up a few years after the events of God of War (2018).\nLow credibility of text: Here's the release date for God of War Ragnarok. God of War Ragnarok is official – for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War… so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that’s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. “So it’s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,” Deane told Al Jazeera. “[Sunak] didn’t have a direct electoral mandate,” Deane said. “… One of the things he is going to have to do … is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.\nLow credibility of text: 31] There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom.[32] Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011,[33] the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:[34] There is no single protocol setting out all of the possible implications. However, the general constitutional position is as set out below. There can be no automatic assumption about who The Queen would ask to act as caretaker Prime Minister in the event of the death of the Prime Minister. The decision is for her under the Royal Prerogative. However, there are some key guiding principles. The Queen would probably be looking for a very senior member of the Government (not necessarily a Commons Minister since this would be a short-term appointment). If there was a recognised deputy to the Prime Minister, used to acting on his behalf in his absences, this could be an important factor. Also important would be the question of who was likely to be in contention to take over long-term as Prime Minister. If the most senior member of the Government was him or herself a contender for the role of Prime Minister, it might be that The Queen would invite a slightly less senior non-contender. In these circumstances, her private secretary would probably take soundings, via the Cabinet Secretary, of members of the Cabinet, to ensure that The Queen invited someone who would be acceptable to the Cabinet to act as their chair during the caretaker period.\nLow credibility of text: No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[40] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.  On taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:   His Majesty the King [Her Majesty the Queen] has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.[41] Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3]  In 2010, the prime minister received £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[42] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.  The prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister.\nHigh credibility of text: We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

He was forced to announce his resignation in July after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the UK’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years.

Considered a centrist and pragmatic politician, he emerged in the latest leadership contest as a safe pair of hands to guide the U.K., after Liz Truss' policy proposals around tax cuts and spending shook the government's credibility and spooked markets.

U.S. President Joe Biden calls it a ‘groundbreaking milestone’ as Rishi Sunak becomes British Prime Minister. Sunak will be the first person of color to lead the United Kingdom. (Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.\nLow credibility of text: He promises to fix them.

The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream — versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.\nLow credibility of text: Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

Netflix said Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called Standard with ads (formerly it was Basic with ads). Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023.   \"More than a quarter of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available,\" Greg Peters, Netflix's co-CEO, said in a news release. \"Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads plans.\"  Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans from other streaming services, like Disney Plus and HBO Max (soon to be called just Max). These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs $7 a month.

Here’s our guide to all the key filming locations in The White Lotus season 2.  As with the first season, most of the show is centred around the antics of the monied guests staying at an uber luxurious resort – in the first season that was the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, and for the second season the team chose another Four Seasons resort: the grand San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina. Situated high on the rocks, it offers up splendid views over the Ionian Sea, Mount Etna and an ancient amphitheatre.\n\nQuestion:Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place\nAnswer:"

The seat was previously held by Republican John McCain, who won his final term in 2016. McCain died on August 25, 2018, and Governor Doug Ducey appointed former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl to fill the seat. Kyl resigned at the end of that year and Ducey replaced him with Martha McSally, who then lost to Democrat Mark Kelly in 2020. Primaries in Arizona took place on August 2. Kelly won renomination without opposition, while venture capitalist Blake Masters won the Republican nomination against a large field of candidates. Although Arizona typically leans Republican, Kelly led Masters by low single digits in aggregate polling.

If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden’s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren’t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.  Still, dozens of seats are in play, including many of those held by Democrats who won in suburban districts in 2018, winning the majority for the party that year.

The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump’s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens. History also gives Republicans reason for optimism.\nLow credibility of text: About Search  History suggests Democratic loss of control of both House and Senate. In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.\nLow credibility of text: In the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won 224 districts, and Donald Trump won 211. Under new districting, Biden won 226 districts, and Trump won 209. Voters typically engage in “straight ticket” voting, meaning that they vote the same way for the House and Senate as they do for presidential elections. However, when breaking down the 2020 election results further, the number of districts that Trump won by more than 15 points goes from 132 under old maps to 143 under new maps. Under new district lines, there are only 33 districts that either Trump or Biden won by fewer than five percentage points. In this year’s House race, 33 districts were rated as toss ups, which made the 2022 midterm election close.

The governor’s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters, 74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as a very tight race, is noteworthy.\nLow credibility of text: — Lazaro Gamio Nov. 9, 2022 Cortez Masto is behind in Nevada at the moment, but there are a lot of votes left in Clark and Washoe, counties home to the state's largest cities.

He’s outperforming Biden across the state and is currently up 8 points in counties that were the closest in 2020.   — Alicia Parlapiano Nov.\nLow credibility of text: With the Senate evenly divided, Nevada is one of two undetermined races that will determine which party controls the chamber, after Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly won his bid for reelection in Arizona late Friday.  If Democrats win Nevada, they will have control even before a December runoff in Georgia between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break a tie. If Republicans win Nevada, control of the Senate will be decided in Georgia.  In another key race, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak lost his reelection bid to his Republican challenger, sheriff Joe Lombardo, on Friday night. Nevada’s count has taken several days partly because of the mail voting system created by the state Legislature in 2020 that requires counties to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day if they arrive up to four days later. Even after the counts are finished this weekend, voters have until the end of the day Monday to “cure” — or fix clerical problems with — their mail ballots, enabling those to be added into the final tally. Gloria said there are 9,600 ballots in the “cure” stage in Clark County, home to three-quarters of the state’s population.\nLow credibility of text: The AP concluded Cortez Masto’s lead would carry even if Republican Adam Laxalt made gains in rural Nevada counties that are still counting votes. Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.  Those categories accounted for nearly 90% of the vote in 2020’s presidential election.  The counties to watch are Clark (anchored by Las Vegas) and Washoe (which includes Reno).\nLow credibility of text: Advertisement Nevada Election Results Sen.

Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who (though initially presented as an \"unearthly child\") was intended[citation needed] as an identification figure for younger viewers.\nHigh credibility of text: We've known for a while that Ncuti Gatwa is the next (well, it's a little more complicated than that right now, so spoiler alert for lower down the page) incumbent of the TARDIS, due to debut as the lead in Doctor Who next year. Now we know who will be his first main companion – Coronation Street's Millie Gibson, playing Ruby Sunday. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor’s companion,\" she says. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get started.\" Ncuti Gatwa adds: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!” Russell T. Davies, who brought the series back in 2005 for its big relaunch, is returning to run it again starting next year.\nLow credibility of text: Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.\nLow credibility of text: The 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her “fam,” and in the big finale episode – “The Power of the Doctor” — several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan filming Doctor Who Season 7 in New York City in April 2012.\nLow credibility of text: Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"It’s the great honour of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already. She’s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I’ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that’s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.\n\nQuestion:Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?\nAnswer:"

In hindsight, Neal’s and Biden’s attendance at the designer’s fall fashion show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York may have been a sign of her intentions.  \t           \tThe location of the private affair — the South Lawn — was a first for White House weddings. After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House’s South Portico with Biden’s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden’s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday’s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama’s administration.\nLow credibility of text: “That was a big, big yes, because they’ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.”  When Biden and Moon visited O’Neill’s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. “[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.\nHigh credibility of text: Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden‘s recent nuptials have gone down in history as the first wedding of a grandchild of a sitting US president at the White House. And now, photos exclusive to Vogue reveal that an Arab designer was a major part of the bride’s big day. While she wore a Grace Kelly-inspired wedding gown by American brand Ralph Lauren to exchange vows with Peter Neal, Biden slipped into a sleek dress from Lebanese designer Reem Acra’s namesake label for the reception and cake-cutting ceremony. Photo: Norman Jean Roy The ivory Mikado silk gown created by Beirut-born Acra came with a delicate strapless neckline, and was made notably special with pearls belonging to Biden’s grandmother Roberta Buhle sewn into the sweeping six-foot train. Biden paired the dress with pearl jewelry of her own, and sheer gloves. Acra was also the designer of choice for First Lady Jill Biden, who wore two dresses from the brand on the day: A custom couture silk chiffon vintage blue dress with a teal wool crepe coat for the ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress for the black-tie reception. Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden is the daughter of US president Joe Biden’s younger son, Hunter, and his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, and is an associate at the DC law firm Arnold & Porter.\nLow credibility of text: Dolan, who published the aptly-named wedding photography book “The Perfect Imperfect” last year, was one of several authors at the nuptials. The bride’s mother debuted “If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction and Healing” in June and her father released his memoir “Beautiful Things” last year.  \tFor the ceremony, the bride wore Tiffany & Co. Victoria earrings and the groom sported a Schlumberger single brooch from the company. Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House. That independent New York-based female-founded brand gained international attention after First Lady Jill Biden wore a blue tweed coat with velvet lapels and a coordinating dress from the previously little-known brand.  \t           \tNaomi Biden’s bridal choices stand to impact future brides, since high-profile weddings routinely create fashion trends and interest in the labels that were worn.\nLow credibility of text: Photographs by Corbin Gurkin.

Dr. Biden is teaching today and coming straight back to change into her gold embroidered seafoam blue Reem Acra dress and glittering Jimmy Choo pumps that she will be wearing to the reception (for the wedding she chose a teal wool crepe coat and silk chiffon dress also by Acra). The first lady beams when she takes in Naomi; she’s only seen the dress in sketches, and lace from her own wedding dress is stitched into the bodice. “Oh, honey!” she coos, arms outstretched. (Asked about her favorite memories of her own wedding, Dr. Biden recalled how “spontaneously Beau and Hunter, little boys at the time, stood at the altar with me and Joe.”) The pair sit together on the mint striped-silk sofa. The first lady’s dress is structured with a built-in corset, but Dr. Biden assures the crew she’s perfectly comfortable and can do whatever is needed. “I can move, but I don’t know if my dress will,” she says with a laugh when Vogue’s photographer, Norman Jean Roy, asks her to turn toward Naomi.

If teams are tied on points, goal difference is the first tiebreaker followed by goals scored. If teams are also tied in those categories another set of tiebreakers is applied.  The winners of the last World Cup in 2018, France will be determined to retain the crown, although they will have to fare considerably better than they did at Euro 2021, when they were knocked out at the Round of 16 stage by Switzerland.  If superstar Kylian Mbappe is at his best, then it could make all the difference for Les Bleus, and there is plenty of other international experience also in Didier Deschamps’ talented squad despite a rash of injuries heading into the tournament. France won the 2020/2021 UEFA Nations League by beating Spain in the final, and if they can perform as a cohesive unit then they will certainly be among the leading contenders for glory in Qatar.

Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the \"most surprising\" in World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup, after drawing 1–1 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their opening match.\nLow credibility of text: Recap/highlights: Argentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia - Lusail Iconic Stadium, LusailRecap/highlights: Mexico 0-0 Poland - Stadium 974, DohaRecap/highlights: Poland 2-0 Saudi Arabia - Education City Stadium, Al RayyanRecap/highlights: Argentina 2-0 Mexico - Lusail Iconic Stadium, LusailRecap/highlights: Poland 0-2 Argentina - Stadium 974, DohaRecap/highlights: Saudi Arabia 1-2 Mexico - Lusail Iconic Stadium, Lusail           Follow along with ProSoccerTalk for the latest news, scores, storylines, and updates surrounding the 2022 World Cup, and be sure to subscribe to NBC Sports on YouTube!  1.

By Mark McKee | Published 11 months ago  CBS had a relative TV goldmine from 2005 to 2020 when the FBI Behavior Analysis Unit traveled the country, bringing to justice the worst criminals within the borders. Criminal Minds revolutionized the murder mystery on TV with a stellar cast of characters that used their expert talents in human nature to chase after the worst the country had to offer. Spencer Reid, Derek Morgan, Jennifer Jareau, David Rossi, Aaron Hotchner, and Emily Prentiss captivated audiences for a decade and a half before the show came to an end in 2020. Fans didn’t have to wait long for news of a revival, as the team couldn’t stay away from a new series premiering this Fall on Paramount+. The latest iteration of the series has now found its title. Deadline reports the new series will appear under the title Criminal Minds: Evolution.  Just before the pandemic began, fans saw the BAU chase after The Chameleon to close out a series that had to create 15 years of diabolical murderers without allowing it to get stale. The series ended with Spencer Reid in a coma and traversing the memories of agents he worked with in the past.\nLow credibility of text: Next: Criminal Minds Reboot Confirms Who BAU’s Most Important Character Is\n\nQuestion:What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?\nAnswer:"

Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 – the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost’s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn’t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation’s five biggest conferences.

With its short-format videos favoring snappy, easily replicable, and endlessly reusable content, it’s managed to grab and hold the attention of not only the youngest members in the audience it’s often associated with but people of all ages and walks of life. What’s truly remarkable about TikTok, though, is that it’s managed to make text-to-speech voices and voice-overs a staple of social media content creation. Thanks to TikTok Voice (i.e., its text to speech feature), this video platform can quickly provide the user with additional functionality and accessibility since it allows them to hear what’s on the screen.

Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was using her voice without permission. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time. A lawyer for Standing said the settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone call with The Verge. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to use it. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Standing said her voice was meant to be used for Chinese translations It sounds as though some strange mixup led to Standing’s voice being used by TikTok in the first place.

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach. Now, the Little Women filmmaker is set to direct the film as well, as sources have confirmed to Variety. (Robbie mentioned it in a recent interview as well.)

Emma Mackey is confirmed to be playing Barbie as well as Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and Issa Rae. Confused? You'll just have to wait and see what kind of movie magic director Greta Gerwig whips up for the film!  Emma Mackey spoke to Empire and exclusively confirmed that all of the Barbies got together at the beginning of shooting and had a sleepover together — which is so cute that we can hardly handle it. Emma revealed that their activities involved \"playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa].\" The Sex Education actress seemed happy about her Barbie role, saying, \"It’s great to do comedy because Emily was a sad, dark drama. Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.” We like to think that the sleepover was pink, too — were there pillow fights and matching pink PJs? How do we score a pair?!

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'  She also spoke about her feeling towards playing Barbie in the film, saying: 'It's great to do comedy.

As Margot Robbie (Barbie) tells America Ferrera, we're officially going to Barbieland. Still, everyone's favorite Mattel doll has her sights set on more than just a little fun. The preview may look like a candy-colored dreamland—but after she's leaves Barbieland, Barbie (and... Ken) go on an epic adventure to the human world in search of true happiness.  Barbie is Gerwig's latest directorial endeavor, which she wrote alongside her partner, Noah Baumbach. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie—or, at least, one of the Barbies—and Ryan Gosling and his cursed platinum blonde hair will take on Ken.)

Then, we get all-too-brief glimpses of Robbie, Gosling, Issa Rae, and Simu Liu hamming it up in the Barbie-verse before Barbie and Ken decide to leave town.

He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32 career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32 Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities.

Workers in this plan include truck drivers, warehouse workers, construction workers, and food processors. Without the historic Special Financial Assistance program included in President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, these workers and retirees – who have already earned these benefits – would have faced estimated benefit reductions of roughly 60% in the next few years.

The bailout was approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to more than 200 nearly insolvent multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. \"With today's actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve,\" Biden told the cheering crowd at a Cleveland high school. Millions of union workers, that is. If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way—even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security looms on the brink of insolvency. Oh, and you'll have to pay back (with interest!) the money borrowed to make this bailout (and the rest of the American Rescue Plan) possible.

Winning the O’Brien and being a Heisman finalist are both well-deserved honors for Duggan. — Khan  Chuck Bednarik Award – Defensive Player of the Year Biletnikoff Award – Outstanding Receiver Lou Groza Collegiate Place-Kicker Award – Outstanding Kicker Ray Guy Award – Punter of the Year Maxwell Award – Player of the Year Davey O’Brien National Quarterback Award – Best Quarterback Outland Trophy – Most Outstanding Interior Lineman Paycom Jim Thorpe Award – Best Defensive Back Doak Walker Award – Premier Running Back (Photo: Gary A.\n\nQuestion:Who won the Maxwell Award 2022 in college football?\nAnswer:"

All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.\nHigh credibility of text: 1934: Egypt, 1970: Morocco, 1974: Zaire, 1978: Tunisia, 1982: Algeria & Cameroon, 1986: Algeria, 1990: Egypt, 1994: Cameroon & Morocco, 1998: Cameroon, Morocco, South Africa & Tunisia, 2002: Cameroon, Nigeria, South Africa & Tunisia, 2006: Angola, Ivory Coast, Togo & Tunisia, 2010: Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria & South Africa, 2014: Cameroon, Ivory Coast & Ghana, 2018: Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal & Tunisia, 2022: Cameroon, Ghana & Tunisia Egypt were the first team from Africa to play at the World Cup — losing 4-2 to Hungary in the first round in Italy in 1934. Including their elimination, African teams have fallen in the first round 38 times. However, even when African sides have bowed out early it has rarely been without incident. Some notable highlights have been Zaire reportedly not knowing the rules for a free kick in 1974, Roger Milla dancing by the corner flag in 1990 and South Africa’s Siphiwe Tshabalala’s opening goal in the 2010 tournament — the only one to be held in Africa — resulting in a continent exploding in joy.\nLow credibility of text: So one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.\nLow credibility of text: The continent’s representatives would have to punch above their weight in Qatar as no African nation has made it past the last-eight of the World Cup. There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated. They were ultimately undone by fatigue and a golden goal, but that success launched the mainstream appeal of Senegalese football.\nLow credibility of text: 1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime. Advertisement Senegal followed in Cameroon’s footsteps in 2002 in South Korea and Japan — in more ways than one. They beat the defending champions (France) in the tournament’s opening game on their way to qualifying for the knockout stages.\n\nQuestion:Who is Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists\nAnswer:"

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, will be awarded at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy.

The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly. “Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing.

The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn’t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA’s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association’s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, “Because it’s worth doing. Yeah, it’s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.“ Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn’t have a background in college athletics or higher education.\nLow credibility of text: Isn't this whole thing supposed to be for and about them? ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm.\nLow credibility of text: Media Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J. DeGioia announced by mutual agreement with the board that Mark Emmert will be stepping down as president of the NCAA.  He will continue to serve in his role until a new president is selected and in place or until June 30, 2023.   \"Throughout my tenure I've emphasized the need to focus on the experience and priorities of student-athletes,\" said Emmert.  \"I am extremely proud of the work of the Association over the last 12 years and especially pleased with the hard work and dedication of the national office staff here in Indianapolis.\" \"With the significant transitions underway within college sports, the timing of this decision provides the Association with consistent leadership during the coming months plus the opportunity to consider what will be the future role of the president,\" said DeGioia. \"It also allows for the selection and recruitment of the next president without disruption.\" NCAA member schools adopted a new constitution in January and are in the process of transforming the structure and mission to meet future needs. 08.07.23 08.03.23 08.03.23 08.02.23 08.02.23 Thanks for visiting !

This one makes sense. Schulz might have his choice between Big 12 commissioner and NCAA president, though he has already publicly denied interest in both positions.

That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal.\n\nQuestion:Who is the new president of the NCAA?\nAnswer:"

He did not name her but said she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.” (May 11) Elon Musk confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with deep ties to the advertising industry.  “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino “will focus primarily on business operations” while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships.  Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which is now called X Corp.

The sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters and $300.5 million internationally for a $434.5 million global debut, according to studio estimates on Sunday.  It tied with “The Batman” as the fourth highest domestic debut of the year, behind “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” ( $187.4 million in May ), “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” ( $181 million in November ) and “Thor: Love and Thunder” ($144.2 million in July).  Expectations were enormous for “Avatar 2,” which carried a reported price tag of over $350 million, the pressure of following up the highest grossing film of all time (thanks in part to various re-releases) over a decade later and the daunting task of propping up an exhibition business that’s still far from normal. Everything “Avatar” is oversized, though: the Na’vi characters, the runtime (a staggering three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century Studios and The Walt Disney Co.

'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009’s Avatar—the highest-grossing film of all time—opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported—nearly double the $26.7 million the first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150 million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5 million) and The Batman (56.6 million). It was also narrowly edged out by Jurassic World Dominion, another sequel in the rebooted Jurassic Park franchise, which made $59.5 million on its opening day.\nLow credibility of text: IMAX and premium large format (PLF) made up nearly one third of the highly produced movie’s ticket sales on Thursday and Friday, Deadline reported. Avatar: The Way of Water, which has been years in production, received two Golden Globes nominations earlier this week, for best drama film and best director. Reviews have generally been positive, with viewers giving it a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while critics on the site give it a 78%. It also has a 69/100 review from critics and a 71/100 general review on Metacritic, and posted a score of 8.2/10 on IMDb. Earlier this week, the Hollywood Reporter called the sequel “monumental,” and said it “justifies its three-hours-plus of screen time and its mammoth financial investment,” although Variety was less favorable in its review, criticizing the movie for having “almost zero dimensionality to the characters,” while The Guardian dubbed it a “trillion-dollar screensaver.” $400 million. That’s how much Avatar: The Way of Water reportedly cost to produce. Cameron told GQ last month it needs to be the “third or fourth highest grossing film in history” in order to break even. The first Avatar movie grossed over $2.\nLow credibility of text: Some even said $175 or higher, but tracking has also not been as reliable a metric during the pandemic.  Disney saw early that “The Way of Water” was going to be a different kind of beast when they looked at pre-sales. For a normal, spoiler-heavy movie like many Marvel offerings, post-opening weekend sales are usually around 5%. For “The Way of Water,” they were at 20%. In other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. “We’ve got a terrific movie that is playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,” said Tony Chambers, the Walt Disney Co.’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. “We’ve got the screens and we’ve got a clear run. This isn’t about the opening day or the opening weekend. This is about the entire run.” The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on Thursday evening. Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D format and premium large screens.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.\nLow credibility of text: 8] In fact, prior to the award's creation, only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture: 1991's Beauty and the Beast, also by Disney.[9][10]  By 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider.[11] The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards,[12] held on March 24, 2002.[13] The Academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters.[14] It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable.[15] People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.  In 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story 3.\nLow credibility of text: Even though 'Puss In Boots: The Last Wish' put up quite a fight, 'Pinocchio' has dominated the circuit  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tClayton Davis  Senior Awards Editor  Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis.

Netflix’s “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” has won every possible award for animation on its march to the 95th Oscars ceremony, including the Annies, ACE and PGA awards.  \tGuillermo del Toro will be the first person, and Latino, to have Oscars for best picture, director and animation, along with Netflix becoming the first streamer to win this category. He previously won statuettes for “The Shape of Water” (2017).  \tEveryone loves Guillermo!\nLow credibility of text: However, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]  From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]  In 2010, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol (2009) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, James stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as Bailey put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\n\nQuestion:What movie won the Oscar for Best Animated Film in 2023?\nAnswer:"

But sometimes the gravity of the Earth can also capture small asteroids, which then remain for a certain period of time, orbiting us as a kind of temporary moon. This has happened at least twice this century: “mini-moons” have remained in Earth’s orbit for several years or even less. But the newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG has probably been trapped in gravity for several decades. An interesting space rock was first observed on December 15, 2022. Interestingly, one of the first to notice it was amateur astronomer Henadii Borisov from Crimea, also known for the discovery of the first known interstellar comet, which now bears his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it is originally catalogued, has a diameter of 16-30 meters. Early computer models of its orbit showed that it completed a total orbit of the Earth in one year. Moreover, this has been happening since about 1961. The simulation showed that the quasi-moon will continue to orbit the Earth until 2181, when it can finally free itself from the gravity of the Earth. Visualization of the orbital data for the year 2022 YG also shows that it takes a strange path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a rounder orbit and stretching again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats.\nLow credibility of text: He said it was “fascinating that we can pull additional observations of known objects or entirely new objects out of surveys and datasets.” At UW, Eli was also the president of the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group, studying at Manastash Ridge Observatory in Ellensburg, Washington.

Streaming powerhouse Netflix will be teaming up with Zack Snyder after the unprecedented success of his movie Army of the Dead.  After Zack’s lengthy run at Warner Bros and DC, he's found a new home with the streaming service promising an array of exciting new projects. His next film Rebel Moon has been touted to be an epic two-parter with the likelihood of spin-off properties. A lifelong Star Wars fan, Snyder initially intended Rebel Moon as a Star Wars movie. He had the idea to pitch Rebel Moon as a more mature take on the universe created by George Lucas. That idea was shut down after Walt Disney Co. acquired LucasFilm in 2012. Snyder then set up a deal with Deborah Snyder’s production company Stone Quarry and Netflix for Rebel Moon to be reworked into an entirely new universe. Rebel Moon represents a slight shift for Zack Snyder into a distinct sci-fi subgenre that is set in a peaceful colony on the border of a faraway galaxy. The one-time peaceful colony faces an existential threat from the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius. Residents of the colony in a bid to repel this great evil send out a young female dispatch rider named Kora who has a checkered past to solicit the help of different warriors from neighboring planets.

Now, after leaving the DCEU behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead and the forthcoming Rebel Moon.  The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023’s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for the streaming platform. So, if you’re like us, you’ll want to be updated with all things Rebel Moon. Here’s everything you need to know.  Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023. The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2.  Filmed back-to-back, Zack Snyder’s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a limited time.

The new movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale. Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.

From the mind of Zack Snyder comes Rebel Moon — and we’re getting a sneak peek. In an action-packed new teaser that debuted at Netflix’s Tudum: A Global Fan Event, fans finally got a chance to feast their eyes on the visionary auteur’s eagerly awaited new sci-fi fantasy epic. “I thought I knew what a big movie was until I came onto this,” says one of the film’s stars, Ed Skrein, amidst an eye-candy assault of behind-the-scenes footage that includes wild green-screen battles, grueling weapons training and fiery explosions. Front and center in the new featurette are star Sofia Boutella and director Snyder himself, who says that he has been dreaming up the Rebel Moon universe for more than two decades.  The details on the blockbuster are still hush-hush, but here’s what we know: A small peaceful colony on the outskirts of the galaxy is targeted by the insidious Imperium (embodied by a deliciously evil Skrein). But they won’t be facing down the forces of darkness on their own.

That expansion is driven by strong growth in consumer spending and real business investment and by a shrinking U.S. trade deficit (see Table 2-2).

In CBO’s forecast, economic output expands less rapidly from 2027 to 2032 than it does over the 2022–2026 period. Real GDP grows by 1.7 percent per year, on average. Real potential GDP grows at a marginally faster rate.3 The level of real GDP is slightly below the level of real potential GDP from 2027 to 2032, in line with their historical relationship, on average.\nLow credibility of text: 1 percent in 2022 in CBO’s projections. After 2022, growth of real GDP slows because of tightening monetary policy, waning fiscal support, and other factors. See Figure 2-1 Percent Inflation has recently reached its fastest pace in four decades. It is expected to remain high in 2022 because of various factors that continue to restrain supply in the face of strong demand in product and labor markets. Inflation slows in 2023 and 2024 in CBO’s projections, nearing the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent by the end of 2024. See Figure 2-4 Percent The unemployment rate is projected to fall over the next year because of the ongoing expansion of the economy. See Figure 2-3 Percent CBO expects the Federal Reserve to rapidly increase its target range for the federal funds rate over the next two years. In CBO’s projections, the interest rate on 3-month Treasury bills rises in tandem with that increase. See Figure 2-4 As federal spending in response to the coronavirus pandemic wanes and the economic expansion continues, the budget deficit in 2022 is expected to shrink substantially from the amounts recorded in 2020 and 2021 (when deficits, relative to the size of the economy, were larger than at any time since World War II).\nHigh credibility of text: Altogether, CBO now estimates that actual output was about 1.3 percent less in 2021—but potential output was about 0.2 percent greater—than the agency expected last July. In terms of underlying trends that contribute to growth of real potential GDP over the 2022–2031 period, revisions are very modest, and the average annual growth rate over the period, slightly greater than 1.8 percent, is practically unchanged. In nominal terms, however, the agency’s projections of output and income are higher throughout the projection period because projected inflation over the next several years is above the rates anticipated in July. Nominal GDP is 4.9 percent higher, and national income is 3.9 percent higher, in 2031 than CBO projected last summer. CBO currently projects the unemployment rate to be slightly lower and the labor force participation rate to be slightly higher over the 2022–2031 period than in the agency’s July 2021 forecast. CBO’s current projection of the average unemployment rate over the 2022–2026 period is slightly lower than it was in that earlier forecast—now 3.8 percent, down from 4.0 percent. The current projection of the labor force participation rate is also lower—now 62.1 percent instead of 62.4 percent.\n\nQuestion:What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Plus, his teenage counterpart Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel, will also be making his return.   Other cast members set to reprise their roles include Jack Dylan Grazer, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Jovan Armand and Grace Caroline Currey as Billy's foster siblings — while their superhero alter egos will be played by Adam Brody, Meagan Good, Ross Butler and D. J. Cotrona.   New cast members have been recruited to join the sequel as well, including Helen Mirren as Hespera, the daughter of Atlas, alongside Lucy Liu who's cast as her demigod sister, Kalypso. They are the primary villains in Shazam's second installment.

The Flash and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom were moved from 2022 to 2023 to allow time for their visual effects work to be completed, while Shazam!

There was a moment when “Jerry’s” talking about how the grocery story isn’t a great place to hear celebrity gossip. He said something like how it’s difficult to get juicy details while you’re picking up a carton of eggs. There’s a brief beat of silence before the laugh track kicks in, and I guffawed wondering if the AI put that laugh track there because it knows egg prices are absurd right now. There’s another bit where “Elaine” talks about how the city’s passing an ordinance against jaywalking and how she’ll never get anywhere in the city anymore. I don’t understand why, but I laughed along with the laugh track. AI programs are doing a lot these days, up to and including my very job. I’ve never seen an episode of Seinfeld, so I can’t vouch for whether or not an AI can faithfully reproduce what people tell me is one of the all-time great television shows. But the only thing that seems missing is that iconic funky baseline, which I imagine is hard to play if you have 37 fingers.\nLow credibility of text: The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.\nLow credibility of text: The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI’s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying.\nLow credibility of text: “In addition to the third party services we’ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the ‘director,’ as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole,” Hartle said via email. “It’s worth mentioning that we don’t generate the artwork or the laugh track — those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.”  Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of ’90s point-and-click games that came out around the same time as Seinfeld. “We thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically relevant,” Hartle said over email.  This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn’t really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.  One popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It’s titled, “Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.\nHigh credibility of text: The surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it’s never really gone away – it’s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the “story” – if you can call it that – of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, “we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak,” Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. “We collectively call this logic the ‘director’, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?\nAnswer:"

Each student who uses a voucher would receive roughly $5,500, which is 70 percent of that state’s per pupil allocation, Robinson said. The bill passed the Iowa Senate 31-18 on March 30 and has moved to the House.  We cannot gauge whether “the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” because that is a prediction. But Robinson confirmed Konfrst’s statement that 2 percent of Iowa’s K-12 children will have a chance at vouchers. Only 10,000 vouchers would be available for about 485,000 school children in Iowa, he said.  However, other student funding generated from taxes and federal funds will remain in the district that the student leaves. According to the governor’s fact sheet, public schools will retain roughly $1,400 per pupil in property tax dollars for each student from that particular school district who uses a voucher to attend a private school.

Konfrst said in a press release that the bill would harm more Iowa K-12 students than it helps.

Lauren White, Politics Reporter April 7, 2022 PolitiFact Iowa is a project of The Daily Iowan’s Ethics & Politics Initiative and PolitiFact to help you find the truth in politics. If your time is short Back in January, the opening of the Iowa legislative session was full of discussion about letting parents choose their children’s education. Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.  “If the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” Konfrst said in the press release.  SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice.\nLow credibility of text: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under Iowa’s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.\nHigh credibility of text: DES MOINES -- Governor Reynolds signed HF 68 into law today amid hundreds of supporters in the Iowa State Capitol. The Students First Act makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools.  “Public schools are the foundation of our education system and for most families they will continue to be the option of choice, but they aren’t the only choice,” Governor Reynolds stated. “For some families, a different path may be better for their children. With this bill, every child in Iowa, regardless of zip code or income, will have access to the school best suited for them.”  Universal eligibility will be phased in over three years. All incoming Kindergarteners and all public-school students will be eligible beginning year one with the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Eligibility for families of children currently enrolled in accredited private schools will be income based over the first two years.  Parents or guardians who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses. The state has issued a request for proposal (RFP) from businesses with experience managing ESA programs.\n\nQuestion:What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?\nAnswer:"

By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.\nLow credibility of text: AI can be helpful in these moments, synthesizing insights for questions where there’s no one right answer.

Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.\nLow credibility of text: So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.\nHigh credibility of text: Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called \"prompts\", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.[1][2]  The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022.[3] The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion.[4] Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable.[5] Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands.[6]  Midjourney, Inc. was founded in San Francisco, California by David Holz,[7] previously co-founder of Leap Motion.[8] The Midjourney image generation platform first entered open beta on July 12, 2022.[3] However, on March 14, 2022, the Discord server launched with a request to post high-quality photographs to Twitter/Reddit for system's training.  The company has been working on improving its algorithms, releasing new model versions every few months. Version 2 of their algorithm was launched in April 2022[9] and version 3 on July 25.\nLow credibility of text: As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.\n\nQuestion:who founded midjourney?\nAnswer:"

Microsoft announced a new version of its search engine Bing is integrating artificial intelligence chat in a step the tech giant hopes will bolster its place in the online search business (Feb. 7) (AP Video: Manuel Valdes) REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft’s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.  Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. “Think of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful” than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview. A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge.\nLow credibility of text: Microsoft Bing (commonly known as Bing) is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.  Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called \"Explore pane\") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.[4]  In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo!

Ready is joining Pinterest from Google, where he served as President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users and oversaw Google’s vision, strategy and the delivery of its commerce products. Prior to Google, Ready served in various senior leadership roles at PayPal, including Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.   With over 400 million monthly active users, Pinterest has built a healthy advertising business that generated strong cash flow and doubled revenue during the pandemic. In addition, Pinterest has been laser-focused on putting Pinners first, continuously improving its roadmap, investing in creators, shopping and scaling internationally.   “Building Pinterest with such a wildly talented, kind and creative team has been the gift of a lifetime,” said Silbermann. “Today, Pinterest inspires hundreds of millions of people with ideas for every aspect of their lives. We’ve built a growing global business that puts the well-being of our users at the core of everything we do.

And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it.  As you can imagine, this was a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways. That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm.  I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days.  When we started Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our website to show there was a real person who cared about every user.

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn’t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game. Check out our Pikmin 4 review for more details.

Outside of the new Pikmin types, Oatchi will be a major gameplay addition. Aside from being able to fight for you, he will have new abilities you can unlock and upgrade, such as riding him in water and having him break through obstacles in the world. Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once.

PFEIFFER: That's a lot. And how big a deal do you think that is in terms of the impact it has on the company? SCHECHNER: Well, I mean, you can see it from - people inside the company are anxious. You know, Mark Zuckerberg sends a message to staff, and it's 2,200 words long. And, you know, there's some mea culpas in there. But there's also this vision that he's trying to get across of a leaner, more nimble company. And he's actually, at points in this memo, talking about how he thinks it will - and is making things operate more efficiently, more effectively than before. PFEIFFER: During the pandemic, Meta and many other tech companies were just hiring madly. So are these layoffs essentially returning Meta to its pre-pandemic level, or do you see it going deeper than that? Any idea? SCHECHNER: Well, we'll have to see where it ends up landing. But, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, in this memo, what struck me is that he said that this is something that he sees continuing for many years. It's a new economic reality.\n\nQuestion:How many employees did Meta lay off in November?\nAnswer:"

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?\nLow credibility of text: Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.\nLow credibility of text: The Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) released Alpaca, a training recipe based on the LLaMA 7B model that uses the \"Self-Instruct\" method of instruction tuning to acquire capabilities comparable to the OpenAI GPT-3 series text-davinci-003 model at a modest cost.[21][22] Multiple open source projects are[when?] continuing this work of finetuning LLaMA with Alpaca dataset.[23]\n\nQuestion:who trained LLaMA?\nAnswer:"

The audience — including his “Temple of Doom” director, Steven Spielberg — gave Quan a standing ovation as he fought back tears.  “Mom, I just won an Oscar!” said Quan, 51, whose family fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child.  “They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I can’t believe it’s happening,” said Quan. “This is the American dream.”  Minutes later, Quan’s castmate Jamie Lee Curtis won for best supporting actress. Her win, in one of the most competitive categories this year, denied a victory for comic-book fans. Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”) would have been the first performer to win an Oscar for a Marvel movie. Curtis is the rare Oscar winner whose parents were both Oscar nominees: Tony Curtis was nominated for “The Defiant Ones” in 1959 and Janet Leigh was nominated in 1961 for “Psycho.”  The German-language WWI epic “All Quiet on the Western Front” — Netflix’s top contender this year — took four awards as the academy heaped honors on the craft of the harrowing anti-war film. It won for cinematography, production design, score and best international film.

But viewership is expected to bounce back, both because of the slap’s notoriety, and because the year’s two biggest blockbusters, Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water, are nominated for best picture.

Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and Women Talking ($1.1 million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]\nLow credibility of text: By Linda Holmes Of the 20 nominees in acting categories this year, 16 are first-timers.

By Gabe Cohn The 95th Academy Awards were held Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the proudly weird sci-fi movie from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, swept most of the top categories, including best picture and directing. Michelle Yeoh, that movie’s star, won the best actress award, becoming the first Asian actress ever to win that honor. The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in “Everything Everywhere All at Once”; “Navalny,” which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who became the first Black woman to have won two Oscars (this time for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”); “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which won several awards in the first half of the show, including for best international feature, production design and cinematography; and Sarah Polley, who won the best adapted screenplay honor for “Women Talking.” See below for a full list of winners.\nLow credibility of text: 11] Michelle Yeoh was the first Asian winner for Best Actress and the second woman of color overall after Halle Berry, who won for her performance in 2001's Monster's Ball.[12] Furthermore, she was the first woman to identify as Asian to be nominated in that category.[b] Ke Huy Quan became the first Vietnamese person to win an Oscar and the second Asian winner for Best Supporting Actor after Haing S.

Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.  By Stephen Thompson Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, an ambitious stop-motion retelling of the classic children’s story, won best animated feature at Sunday’s Academy Awards. It’s the third Oscar for del Toro, who won twice for The Shape of Water in 2018. The film, which expands on the classic story to include deeper references to grief and fascism, had performed well across this awards season and bested a field rounded out by Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, The Sea Beast and Turning Red.\n\nQuestion:Who won Best Director at the 95th Academy Awards Ceremony?\nAnswer:"

By Gabe Cohn The 95th Academy Awards were held Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the proudly weird sci-fi movie from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, swept most of the top categories, including best picture and directing. Michelle Yeoh, that movie’s star, won the best actress award, becoming the first Asian actress ever to win that honor. The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in “Everything Everywhere All at Once”; “Navalny,” which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who became the first Black woman to have won two Oscars (this time for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”); “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which won several awards in the first half of the show, including for best international feature, production design and cinematography; and Sarah Polley, who won the best adapted screenplay honor for “Women Talking.” See below for a full list of winners.\n\nQuestion:Which movie won Best International Feature Film at the 95th Academy Awards Ceremony?\nAnswer:"

The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk’s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Elon Musk's new AI company?\nAnswer:"

The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC Network. It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday:  1. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.\nLow credibility of text: e-Pilot e-Pilot Evening Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Pilot e-Pilot Evening Edition  \t\t\tTop Picks:\t\t Matt Gentry/AP Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Wells rolls out while observed by head coach Brent Pry during the team's spring game Saturday in Blacksburg.

BLACKSBURG — Once last year’s football season came to an end, Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said the plan in his second year with the Hokies was to upgrade the talent level in the offensive skill positions. Saturday’s spring football game at Lane Stadium was the first time Virginia Tech’s fans got a good glimpse of where things are at in that category. And while some of those new faces may not have been in the spotlight, their impact was evident in what the Hokies were getting out of some of their returning wide receivers and running backs. There was progress, Pry said, although most of that was only seen on the Maroon side of the football.\nLow credibility of text: Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry reacts after a West Virginia touchdown, as Chamarri Conner (25) returns to the sideline during the second half of an NCAA college football game Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022, in Blacksburg, Va.

There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He’d remain there for the first half.   We’ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.  We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.\nLow credibility of text: TechSideline.com Login Password:   \t\t\t\tAll Hokie, All the Time. Period. Presented by    Big plays were in short supply last year for the Hokies. Points, too. You don’t break offensive futility records from 30 or more years ago unless you’ve got issues, a reason Virginia Tech went so hard in the transfer portal for skill guys this offseason. It was only the spring game Saturday, which comes with its usual caveats, but the Hokies appeared to have a deeper roster of play-makers show up in the Maroon team’s 34-0 blanking of the White team in Lane Stadium. Running backs Chance Black and Bryce Duke combined for 152 yards, with Black finding the end zone twice. Tucker Holloway’s three catches for 77 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown in the third quarter, paced a revamped receiver room that has more options. Overall, the Hokies had seven plays go for 20 or more yards Saturday, following up a dismal 2022 season when they averaged just 3.5 such plays per game, among the fewest in the country. “We needed that,” Hokies head coach Brent Pry said. “Everybody has those playmakers. Every good team has enough guys that can get you out of a jam and make a play. When the defense is where they’re supposed to be, they still come down with it and make something happen.\n\nQuestion:Who won the Virginia Tech spring game 2023?\nAnswer:"

The iPhone-maker’s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple’s expansion efforts. Despite being the world’s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple’s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation’s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations “mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.” In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country.\nLow credibility of text: The company has more than 70 highly skilled retail team members at Apple Saket Store, who come from a combined 18 states in India and collectively speak more than 15 languages.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.\nLow credibility of text: Production was disrupted last year at Apple's biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a Covid outbreak and worker protests. That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn. Wedbush's Ives said Apple's India strategy — with both a retail and manufacturing push — mirrors the technology giant's steps it took in the China market 10 years ago. \"As Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,\" Ives said. \"Rome was not built overnight and neither will Apple's broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.\" Correction: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of Dan Ives.

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.\n\nQuestion:Where are Apple's first two stores in India?\nAnswer:"

The company also said that the board has recognised Pichai's \"strong performance\" as CEO and added that the vesting of a significant portion of the award would depend on Alphabet's total shareholder return relative to other S&P 100 companies. Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. said the award was tweaked to increase the performance stock units (PSUs) to 60 per cent from 43 per cent in 2019, while increasing the performance requirement for the payout. According to Reuters, Pichai, who is given an equity award every three years, was granted two tranches of PSUs with a target value of $63 million each and was also given a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet's restricted stock units. As per a filing from 2020, Google disclosed Pichai's annual salary to be at $2 million. According to the IIFL Hurun India Rich List 2022, Pichai's net worth fell 20 per cent to Rs 5,300 crore, but he ranks amongst the top ten richest professional managers on the list.

The Killing Eve actress played the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience.   \t“I feel like I have so much more trust within myself and who I am.

Liverpool is where Comer also grew up. \"I'm definitely scrappy,\" she laughed. \"Yeah, there's a lot of me in her, for sure.\" Comer said her parents and younger brother never doubted she'd succeed as a professional actor, even without formal training. \"They were just, like, if you're gonna commit, commit.\nLow credibility of text: And I said, 'Well, she's Russian.

Miller said she wasn't expecting the audience's tears, which have happened at every performance. Miller, who worked as a human rights lawyer in Australia, and still lives there, said she wrote \"Prima Facie\" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. \"The statistics speak for themselves,\" Miller said. \"One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault.

He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. “There’s some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],” Lloyd said. “It’s like getting started on a term paper.” Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches.

Crocker began his career at Cardiff, where he served as a development coach for the club’s youth teams, before taking on a role at Southampton overseeing the academy setup. During his first tenure with the Saints, players like Gareth Bale, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Luke Shaw and James Ward-Prowse came through the club’s academy.

Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program.

The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride?   On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride’s position might not be filled at all.  \"We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men’s] GM role,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to make.\" When it comes to Stewart’s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.\nLow credibility of text: U.S. Soccer plans to narrow the focus of its sporting director job as part of a slight but significant restructuring near the top of the federation. The role has been vacant since Earnie Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job — which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said — into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said. This will, in turn, allow the sporting director to work almost exclusively on the elite player pathway and the environments and structures surrounding U.S. Soccer's 27 national teams — from the USMNT and USWNT all the way on down to youth teams and what U.S.\n\nQuestion:Who is the new sporting director of U.S. Soccer?\nAnswer:"

In January 2022 it was revealed a feminist action comedy focusing on two British-Pakistani sisters was being filmed in London by Nida Manzoor with Working Title, Focus Features and Parkville Pictures, with a tone and voice similar to Manzoor’s breakthrough and BAFTA, Peabody, and Rose d'Or award winning sitcom series We Are Lady Parts.[5]  In February 2022 it was announced that filming had wrapped on the project in London. It is produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner for Working Title with Olivier Kaempfer and John Pocock for Parkville Pictures. Focus Features had distribution rights.[2][6][7]  The typography & graphic design for the title card, credits, chapter headings and fight sequence introductions was designed by Peter Anderson Studio.[8]  Polite Society was released at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2023,[9] at the 2023 Glasgow Film Festival on 12 March 2023,[10] and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 April 2023.[11][12]\nLow credibility of text: When Manzoor looks at her Bollywood influences, one person who comes to mind is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The popular actress served as an inspiration for the character of Ria in Polite Society. Rai Bachchan — who has starred in films such as Jeans, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and Devdas — is a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and Manzoor admires her body's agility and strength, which also influences Ria's dream to become a stunt performer.  Seeing Jordan Peele's game-changing horror flick Get Out — which put Black actors center stage and was infused with social commentary — convinced Manzoor that Polite Society could one day end up on the big screen, too. \"I remember feeling the audience respond to [Get Out] and thinking maybe there was a place for my film,\" she recalls. Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society. There is a fight that takes place between Ria and her sister Lena, which is gritty and more grounded than some of the other bigger battle scenes in the movie. It take inspiration from the Bourne films and the Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah brawl in Kill Bill.\nLow credibility of text: Even as Lena and Salim’s courtship appears headed to the altar, Salim is still creepily tied to the apron strings of his mysterious mother, Raheela (Nimra Bucha). It’s a good thing Ria has the loyal, all-in support of her besties Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) and Clara (Seraphina Beh), who have her back no matter how crazy things get.  As the story unfolds, audiences are treated to extravagant fight scenes, tight action sequences, and a showstopping Bollywood dance number, all filtered through the experience of one girl coming of age. As such, the script doesn’t shy away from female rage and issues around identity, making the film a unique delight for viewers who’ve rarely seen themselves reflected onscreen.  Manzoor discussed Polite Society with The Credits, pointing to her influences and revealing how her collaborations were integral to making this unusual genre-bending film successful on so many levels.    Polite Society is a love note to your favorite genre movies growing up. Some films mentioned as inspiration are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix, and the Bollywood classic, Devdas. What specific moments might be a callback only fans of those films would recognize?\n\nQuestion:Who is the director of \"Polite Society\"?\nAnswer:"

If you aren’t already in the loop, the NBC network sitcom Grand Crew has been airing on NBC for over a year. It had its first season premiere on Dec. 21, 2021, with two “sneak episodes,” and has since aired eight more episodes. Grand Crew stars Echo Kellum as Noah Koles, a hopeless romantic, Nicole Byer as Nicky Koles, a realtor and Noah’s sister, Justin Cunningham as Wyatt Fields, the crew’s married friend, Aaron Jennings as Anthony Holmes, an accountant and also a vegan. Carl Tart as Sherm Jones, a journeyman and Anthony’s roommate, and Grasie Mercedes as Fay, the “new-to-the-crew” member who works at the crew’s hangout. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the show has received positive reviews and the good news is it has even been renewed for a second season as it was announced in May 2022. As of now, there’s no word on when Grand Crew will return.\nLow credibility of text: I am not shy about my love for NBC’s sleeper hit hangout sitcom, Grand Crew. Since it premiered within a week of Abbott Elementary in December of 2021, it’s the show I’ve been telling everyone and their cousin to catch up on once they’re up to date with Janine and her fellow Philly teachers. I’ve even gone long on it here in Paste’s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series’ press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn’t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew’s now Fay-less Season 3 future—or even if, indeed, it’s likely to see such a future—it was nevertheless a delight. Enjoy the conversation, and then get back to streaming Season 2!

The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn’t a drastic last-minute change to the 2022-2023 lineup.

Everyone who considered it outrageous that Huckabee Sanders could be insulted in such a high-profile setting needs to be reminded that she’s now the governor of Arkansas, where so far she’s banned the use of the word “Latinx,” rolled back child labor laws, and recently endorsed koozies lauding the election of “real women,” a blatant attempt to debase the trans community while trolling Bud Light. Everyone concerned that this woman or democracy itself might have been imperiled by assertions that her eye shadow is composed of deceit particles — which it might be, has there been an investigation? — needs to be reminded that it’s okay to lob some honest, revelatory jokes at our leaders, especially when those people engage in behavior that screams to be ridiculed. The White House Correspondents’ Dinner may be a flawed attempt to do that. (One example of its flaws: The terrible sketch featuring the Property Brothers renovating the White House press room.)

Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case. The phone is available in a dark Obsidian and a light Porcelain colorway.\nLow credibility of text: By  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment.

The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn’t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn’t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we’ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It’ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have “the most durable hinge on a foldable,” along with a price that’s over $1,700. Samsung’s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799. We had expected to see it last year, but the Fold didn’t make the cut for I/O in 2022, and rumors about its launch haven’t slowed down in the year since.\nLow credibility of text: The Google Pixel Fold was in the rumor mill for more than a year, without Google ever acknowledging it's working on it until a few days before Google I/O 2023. With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch. Google's first foldable has arrived with a wider aspect ratio — inside and out — as well as the Tensor G2's AI finesse to help squeeze every pixel out of the cameras and every iota of productivity out of your day.

Incredibly, as of late May, the top 512GB Pixel Fold model is already sold out in the US. If you pre-order the Pixel Fold, Google will also toss in a free Pixel Watch, although this promotion is limited to Germany, the UK, and the US (leaving Japan in the lurch). Otherwise, everyone also gets a 2TB Google One plan for six months and a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium. There’s also a trade-in program for those who want to switch their current handset for the foldable. Google accepts products from Apple, LG, Motorola, OnePlus, and Samsung, and the trade-in’s value differs between the various models. Notably, you can also trade in Google Pixels. For instance, the 128GB Pixel 7 Pro will get you $380 off the Fold’s price. Visit Google’s trade-in portal for the full list of products and offers. The Pixel Fold hasn’t made its mass market debut yet, so you won’t find expert reviews of the foldable. However, based on our experience with the device at Google I/O 2023, the Pixel Fold should do more than enough to challenge the likes of Samsung in this space. In his hands-on preview, C. Scott Brown “came away impressed” by the Pixel Fold. “It felt great. It looked great.\nLow credibility of text: Look, I’m not going to sit here and pretend that the entire world didn’t know this was happening next week, but is a bit of theatrics too much to ask? Google learned a few years back that the best way to juice a product hype cycle is to “leak” the thing yourself, and here we are, facing down a tweet that leaves very little to the imagination. The short video shows the company’s upcoming Pixel Fold unfolding slowly from every conceivable angle. Google’s using Star Wars Day as an excuse to fire up the old hype train, but the truth is it’s priming up the pump with less than a week before it returns to Shoreline for an in-person I/O. There were already a LOT of leaks and rumors floating around, so the company just went ahead and took matters into its own hands. There’s also an official Pixel Fold page where you can sign up for news and the like. There’s still some information that hasn’t been made official, including pricing and release date. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google As seen above, all previous leaks appear to have more or less been on the money. As the name implies, the form factor is more Samsung Galaxy Z Fold than Samsung Galaxy Z Flip — that is, more book than clamshell. The dimensions, on the other hand, appear a bit closer to Oppo’s recent foldable, or even Microsoft’s bygone Surface Duo.\n\nQuestion:When was Pixel Fold announced?\nAnswer:"

The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less. And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical failure over time.

A great camera and a design that means it’s easier to use (or tuck into a pocket) when closed More than a quarter of smartphone owners in the United States are “highly likely” to upgrade to a foldable model next, according to a survey conducted by Counterpoint Research. That leaves Google — long an also-ran in the U.S. smartphone market — with an opportunity. And thankfully, the company’s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn’t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it’s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that’s not the case here. It doesn’t hurt that the Pixel Fold is noticeably thinner than other Samsung options, either. At last: a folding smartphone that won’t feel super awkward in your back pocket. When open, the Fold’s internal 7.\nLow credibility of text: I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the “pro” moniker and will make up the new high end of the market.

Google may well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7, kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though, this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more expensive devices offered.\nLow credibility of text: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — For many watching Google's I/O developer conference this week, the big draw is a full breakdown of the company's broader AI plans. But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?\nAnswer:"

For example, it would allow MS Word to write, edit and summarize your text. Meanwhile, you can use Copilot in PowerPoint to turn ideas into a designed presentation. For example, ask for a slide show related to AI assistants and it will create corresponding slides. It adds text descriptions and creates custom designs based on your topic. Excel with Copilot can also analyze data, identify trends and create data visualizations within minutes. Microsoft 365 Copilot manages your Outlook Inbox so you spend more time communicating with customers and colleagues. The AI tool improves meetings by providing “real-time summaries and action items” in the context of conversations.\nLow credibility of text: By Preston Gralla   \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\tContributing Editor,  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t             Computerworld |    Remember Cortana? Microsoft’s digital assistant that was supposed to go toe-to-toe with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant — that was going to help you with many of your daily tasks; be built into smart speakers; help you control your smart home; play music; check the weather, news, and more? Those days are long gone — so much so that if you say “Hey Cortana” to your Windows 11 computer you won’t get an answer, because the virtual assistant is turned off by default. Which might make you think Cortana is all but dead. But it’s not. In fact, Microsoft has big plans for it — but very different ones from when the product was first released. The company has been uncharacteristically low-key about what it plans for Cortana’s future, so it might have fallen off your radar. It hasn’t fallen off ours, though. We’ve done a fair amount of digging, talked to the head of Cortana development at Microsoft, and interviewed tech industry analysts for their opinions. What follows is an in-depth look at the past, present, and future of the digital assistant. In a nutshell, Microsoft Cortana is an AI-powered virtual assistant that responds to voice commands.\nLow credibility of text: It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1]), after a paperclip.[7][8]  The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob[9] and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.[3] From Office 2000 onward, Microsoft Agent (.acs) replaced the Microsoft Bob-descended Actor (.act) format as the technology supporting the feature. Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in System32 folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout & Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine allowed the Office Assistant to accept speech input.[10]\nLow credibility of text: In Office 2000, the Hoverbot, Scribble, and Power Pup assistants were replaced by F1 (a robot), Links (a cat), and Rocky (a dog). The Clippit and Office Logo assistants were also redesigned. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons.  The Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, Saeko Sensei (冴子先生), an animated secretary, and a version of the Monkey King (Chinese: 孫悟空) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.[19] Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the dolphin in Japanese.  Since their introduction, more assistants have been released and have been exclusively available via download.[20][1]  The 12 assistants for Office 97 could be downloaded from the Microsoft website.[22]  The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.[23][24] Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP, acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac, as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.   The program was widely reviled among users as intrusive and annoying,[25][26] and was criticized even within Microsoft.\nLow credibility of text: The Office Assistant is a discontinued intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character which interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1][2][3][4] (sometimes later called \"Clippy\"), after a paperclip. Clippit was the default, and by far the most notable, Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[5] The Office Assistant and particularly Clippit have been the subject of numerous criticism and parodies. In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip emoji (📎) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.[6]  The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office.

Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.\nLow credibility of text: Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.\nLow credibility of text: It uses AI to deliver recommendations based on you and your work and includes one-click actions to speed you to results. This is a great new tool inside Photoshop where we will continue to add AI capabilities that enhance your experience with the product. Object Aware Refine Edge and Refine Hair both use AI to further improve selections that include tricky subjects like hair or complex backgrounds. You already rely on artificial intelligence features in Photoshop to speed your work every day like Select Subject, Object Selection Tool, Content-Aware Fill, Curvature Pen Tool, many of the font features, and more. Our goal is to systematically replace time-intensive steps with smart, automated technology wherever possible. With the addition of these five major new breakthroughs, you can free yourself from the mundane, non-creative tasks and focus on what matters most – your creativity. Here’s everything we released in Photoshop today:         Sky Replacement Neural Filters is a new workspace inside Photoshop that introduces new non-destructive filters to help you explore creative ideas in seconds. In it we have taken many things Photoshop does well and improved them by reducing complex workflows to one click or a couple of sliders using machine learning. You can discover a rapidly growing and improving library of artistic and restorative filters, find a “best” idea for inspiration, and refine your image with the familiar tools you know in Photoshop. The filters in this workspace will speed parts of your workflow, but they might not produce the result you need every time.\nHigh credibility of text: In addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year’s annual I/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.\nLow credibility of text: Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?\nAnswer:"

Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that “seamlessly” blends the real and digital world. “It’s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,” CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says “hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps” will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they’re resting low on your body.\nLow credibility of text: Apple did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. The Vision Pro is Apple’s much anticipated foray into virtual reality and its launch could be as important to the company as its other major products like the iPhone. It is billed as a mixed reality headset that blends the virtual and real world—one can switch between full virtual reality and “augmented” reality mixing virtual and real elements—and has been a poorly kept secret that has been years in the making. Investors hope it will fire up interest in the sector, which has been around for years but struggled to take off in a major way. Its high price tag puts it at the upper end of the market—it is working on a cheaper model—which analysts expect will limit initial demand to loyal Apple fans and wealthier customers. The headset’s design and high costs of the technology it uses have reportedly forced Apple to lower its ambitions for the device’s rollout to manage manufacturing difficulties. The issues have reportedly pushed the company to drop its 2024 production goal from more than 1 million units to fewer than 400,000. Apple will push Vision Pro into other markets toward the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg.

The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask—including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses—necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.\nLow credibility of text: Checking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday considered a new angle on Apple's divisive virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, linking the product to the ongoing battles between the most popular wireless carriers. Some were shocked just a few weeks ago when Apple execs revealed the Vision Pro's price tag: at $3,500 a pop, the Vision Pro is one of Apple's more expensive consumer products. Cramer noted that some rationalized the steep cost by figuring Apple's Vision Pro would open the doors for less expensive headsets of a similar ilk. But Cramer sees potential for major wireless carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T to capitalize on the new product by offering discounts on plans in exchange for cheaper phones.\nLow credibility of text: Apple’s headset headache: the tiny and costly displays inside the Vision Pro (Financial Times) Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro (Bloomberg) Apple Reportedly Expects To Sell Fewer Than 400,000 Vision Pro Headsets Next Year Due To Production Snags (Forbes)\n\nQuestion:What is the price of the Apple Vision Pro headset?\nAnswer:"

The headset is believed to be the same size as Meta’s Oculus Quest and focused on high-tech and high-performance. Additionally, it’s said to include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive?  The new product will find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as headliners. A sneak peek of the new headset could also be on the agenda, as the company looks to entice developers to create content for the new category. Executives are believed to have already shown off a version of the product to shareholders.\nLow credibility of text: Apple is working on at least three augmented-reality and virtual-reality headset devices, the first of which will likely launch with the name \"Apple Reality Pro,\" according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian ZelboIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, Gurman explained that there are a minimum of three Apple headsets actively in development that he is aware of, under the codes \"N301,\" \"N602,\" and \"N421.\" The first of these devices, N301, is what Gurman believes will be called \"Apple Reality Pro.\" Apple Reality Pro is said to be the company's \"high-end rival\" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the \"Reality Pro\" name lines up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including \"Reality Processor,\" \"Reality Pro,\" and \"Reality One.\nLow credibility of text: The Reality Processor would naturally refer to the custom Apple silicon designed for the device. The chip is expected to be similar to the M2 chip seen in the 2022 MacBook Air. The Information said the first-generation headset would also feature a special coprocessor to manage the imaging pipeline. Apple’s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything’s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release. What we do expect to see on September 7 is the iPhone 14 lineup and Apple Watch Series 8. The headset will most likely be announced in the spring of 2023.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Apple's headset?\nAnswer:"

Kate Ryder: Thank you so much for having me. Thrilled to be here in Aspen. So I founded Maven in 2014 because I saw firsthand a lot of the gaps in the in the women’s and family health care model. And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren’t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we’re also the richest country that spends the most on health care. And so you know, what Maven does is we really fill in all of these very distinct gaps through a virtual care and financial support platform. So we have the largest telehealth network and women’s and family health.\nLow credibility of text: In 2014, Ryder founded Maven Clinic, a digital company offering support for fertility and family planning, pregnancy and postpartum, adoption, surrogacy, and parenting.[10]  In January 2017, Ryder was named to Fast Company's list of Most Creative People in Business, in the Science and Health category.[11]  In April 2018, Ryder was featured in TIME Magazine's The Boss series of profiles, where she described her inspiration for founding Maven Clinic.[12]  In September 2019, Ryder was named to business magazine Inc's Female Founder's 100 list.[13]  In February 2020, she helped close a $45 million Series C funding round for the company, and announced Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Natalie Portman and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki as investors in Maven.[14] Also in 2020, business magazine Fortune selected Ryder to its list of 40 under 40 for Healthcare, and Crain's New York Business named her to its Notable in Healthcare 2020 list.[3][5]  In August 2021, Maven Clinic announced a $110 million Series D funding round which included participation from Oprah Winfrey, making the company the first unicorn in women's and family health.[15] In November, Ryder was recognized by healthcare industry news website Fierce Healthcare as one of its 2021 Women of Influence.[2]\nLow credibility of text: Among other major partnerships, MassHealth, the Massachusetts, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program partnered with Maven to provide free telemedicine appointments for members experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, enabling them to readily set up remote appointments without exposing providers to infection risk. Maven raised $110 million in August in a Series D financing round, at a valuation at over $1 billion, officially making it the only U.S. unicorn in the women’s and family health sector. Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital co-led the round, along with an added publicity boost of having Oprah Winfrey as a new backer. The company’s unicorn status has left Ryder feeling humbled. “Women’s and family health is wide open. This market is just opening right now and to be able to marry the virtual to the brick-and-mortar to develop this new care model that’s totally seamless for the patient — it’s not going to happen overnight, but we have the opportunity to really steer that, and that’s super exciting.\nLow credibility of text: Ryder recently told CNBC that the company saw a 67% month-over-month increase in opportunities from companies looking for travel benefits, as well as other health-care support for pregnant women, after the SCOTUS decision. \"Because we're in the market, because we had a platform that we were able to access, we were able to jump up and step up with our products,\" Ryder said at the recent CNBC Work Summit.  Maven Clinic has experienced a broader increase in demand for its products over the past two years amid a pandemic and tight labor market, which she attributed to the accessibility of its virtual platform as well as its outspoken support of health equity. \"The overturning of Roe v. Wade created additional inequities in a system already riddled with them, in a country where 50% of counties don't have an OB-GYN and where maternal mortality rates surpass those of all other developed countries,\" she wrote in the blog post. Maven now reaches 15 million members, a 5x increase from last year, across its 450-plus corporate clients and payers (insurance companies) in over 175 countries, and the platform supports over 30 provider specialties in 30 provider languages.

Ryder has said in the past that her determination to create Maven came partially as a result of her own medical frustration and trauma. A miscarriage left her feeling \"lost, discouraged, and confused why something so painful and physically taxing was considered outside the bounds of traditional healthcare,\" she wrote in a blog post. With the new funding, Ryder said the company needs to be careful about how it scales, but will not be conservative with the cash despite the current economic environment given the need to invest in growth opportunities. \"We're not putting this capital aside for a rainy day,\" she wrote on Monday. Global family benefits growth and Medicaid are two areas that Maven is prioritizing with the new funding. The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform. Additional Medicaid expansion requires \"a more localized approach, which must be more deliberate,\" Ryder said, \"but particularly in the aftermath of Roe, the need has never been greater.\" The Maven CEO laid out some more of her strategic thinking after the fundraise in a series of Twitter posts.

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13.

In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic.

But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale — and there's no reason to think it won't — you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.

Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players—Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes—have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]\nLow credibility of text: The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy.\nLow credibility of text: Making matters worse, the Rams could not run the football, totaling just 43 yards on the ground. But on the deciding drive, they moved the ball 79 yards on 15 plays for the winning score.  Kupp finished with three catches for 30 yards on the drive. He also ran for a critical first down on fourth-and-1 from L.A.’s 30-yard line, scampering 7 yards on an end-around to keep the chains moving. In addition, he coaxed two defensive penalties in the end zone to get Los Angeles closer to scoring position. \"That’s hard work, hours spent together,\" Stafford said when asked about the chemistry between him and Kupp. \"I just thank Coach for putting it in our hands: ‘Hey, Matthew, you and Coop go get this thing done.’ He kept calling plays for him, finding ways to get him the ball, and he made unbelievable plays. That’s what he does.\" Added Sean McVay: \"We were able to get them into some more regulated looks by playing fast. They still were tight-window throws. [Cincinnati] made it really difficult tonight. I’ve got a lot of respect for the Bengals’ defense, but we were able to find a way.\"  Kupp became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP and the first since Julian Edelman took home the trophy in Super Bowl LIII.\nLow credibility of text: GLENDALE, Ariz. — For the second time of his career, Patrick Mahomes is a Super Bowl champion and Super Bowl MVP. The Chiefs quarterback was named the Super Bowl 57 MVP after he led Kansas City to a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He is the sixth player ever to win multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. Mahomes went 21 of 27 passing for 182 yards and three touchdowns despite playing on a ginger ankle that was reaggravated in the first half. He also added 44 rushing yards in the win. The Chiefs trailed 24-14 at halftime and rattled off 24 second-half points. Mahomes and the Chiefs scored on every possession in the second half.  Prior to Sunday, teams that trailed by at least 10 points at halftime were 1-26 in the Super Bowl, per NFL Research. Kansas City rallied back and became the second team to erase at least a 10-point deficit. Super Bowl 57 was the first time two Black quarterbacks started against each other in a Super Bowl. Appropriately, the championship game was a showcase of spectacular performances between Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. Mahomes’ Super Bowl 57 MVP capped off a stellar year for the Chiefs quarterback. He led the NFL with 5,250 passing yards and 41 touchdowns in the regular season, the only quarterback to eclipse 5,000 passing yards and 40 touchdowns this year.\nHigh credibility of text: Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Fittingly, Super Bowl LVI was won by the NFL's most prolific offensive player.
