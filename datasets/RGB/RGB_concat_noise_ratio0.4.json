                "value": "Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos), who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity?                     Suggest an update.

Parents need to know that Good Sam is a medical procedural featuring a father-and-daughter heart surgeon team who hash out their familial drama as they save patients. Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as conversations about a near-fatal car accident, \"coding\" (needing to be resuscitated), and other medical lingo.\nThe new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.\u00a0 RELATED:\u00a010 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey\u2019s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam\u2019s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed \u201cdysfunctional family dramas\u201d.  ABC's\u00a0The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a\u00a0brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore\u2019s committed performance\u00a0as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.\u00a0 Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor\u2019s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.\nBased on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.\nInspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai\u00a0reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children\u2019s actions. RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.\nEdwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.\nQuestion:The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?\nAnswer:"

Semore joins Georgia Tech for the second time in his career, after spending a year away at Valdosta State. He takes over the linebackers from Defensive Coordinator Andrew Thacker.\nby Andy Demetra (The Voice of the Yellow Jackets) Inside The Chart On The Map: The upbringing that makes newly minted special teams coordinator Jason Semore unlike almost any coach in Division I football You\u2019ve read this story before. Kid grows up a small-town coach\u2019s son. Follows his dad into the business.\u00a0 Grinds his way up the coaching ladder, establishing his own success. That doesn\u2019t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches\u2019 sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets\u2019 special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana. But Semore\u2019s background makes him unlike any coach\u2019s son at the Division I level. Maybe any coach in Division I, period. And the answer lies innocuously at the top of his bio. Hometown: Ganado, Ariz. It\u2019s an easy piece of information to gloss over, or skim past, or remain incurious about. Every coach and player has it listed obligatorily on their roster page.\nA hugely successful high school quarterback, he threw for over 5,300 yards and 59 touchdowns at North Florida Christian High School before spending the early part of his college career at FSU. However, it was at West Virginia where his playing career took off, leading the Big 12 in completion percentage in 2014 while becoming a semifinalist for the Davey O\u2019Brien Award. A new addition to the Marshall coaching staff for the 2023 college football season, Jason Semore becomes the Thundering Herd\u2019s defensive coordinator. He arrives in Huntington having spent the last season with Georgia Tech, the latest stop on a varied and successful coaching career that has seen him gain experience in multiple roles at several different levels of competition. A linebacker at Adams State from 2001-2005, Semore spent 2022 working with the Georgia Tech linebackers and was slated to become their special teams coordinator with responsibilities for nickel backs and safeties. Instead, he reprises a role he previously held at Valdosta State, Montana, and the Colorado School of Mines, in addition to co-DC duties at his alma mater. He has tasted success in each of those stints. Semore helped lead Colorado School of Mines to a 10-2 season, assisted Montana in achieving three consecutive winning seasons and top-ranked Big Sky defense, and his defense fueled a Valdosta State run to the DII title game in 2021.\n2006 | Round Valley (AZ) High School (Defensive Coordinator) 2007 | Colorado School of Mines (Secondary Coach) 2008 - 2009 | Adams State (Co-Defensive Coordinator/Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2010 - 2011 | Tulsa (Outside Linebackers Coach) 2012 - 2013 | Oklahoma State (Defensive Assistant) 2014 | Colorado School of Mines (Defensive Coordinator) 2015 | Montana (Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2016 - 2017 | Montana (Defensive Coordinator) 2018 | Temple (Senior Defensive Advisor) 2019 - 2020 | Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst) 2021 | Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator) Semore actually has more experience than I remember seeing, but this is still the highest level position he has held and is sure to bring plenty of challenge.  At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker. Though he remains defensive coordinator in name, he is no longer the linebackers coach.\nJason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. \u2014 He\u2019s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona.

Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent. Shopicar.\nAnalysts predict that Tesla\u2019s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company\u2019s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles: \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year\u2026 Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we\u2019ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,\u201d Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla\u2019s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has produced 3,429,532 cars.\nQuestion:How many vehicles did Tesla deliver in 2021?\nAnswer:"

The United States of America: the land of the free, the Super Bowl and some of the greatest sports stadiums the world has ever seen. Brand new behemoths continue to spring up across the land with fresh, state-of-the-art stadiums generally favoured by the NFL to host the Super Bowl in their first couple of years after opening. Last year saw the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles given a starring role after opening in 2020, while the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Atlanta and US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis have each been christened with the Super Bowl in recent times. The new Allegient Stadium in Las Vegas, home to the relocated Raiders, also opened in 2020 but is not scheduled to host the Super Bowl until 2024, meaning another relatively old stadium has leaped in to fill the gap. RadioTimes.com brings you everything you need to know about the Super Bowl stadium in 2023. The Super Bowl will be held in Glendale, Arizona this year. The area last hosted the Super Bowl in 2015, a relatively short space of time to host the event twice.

Former US President Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform, called Truth Social, is now available to download on iOS. So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President\u2019s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump\u2019s social network about anyway? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.\nWith the Android app still unavailable, not a lot has actually changed since Truth Social launched on iPhone. However, there's a workaround. The Truth Social app is still not available to download on Android devices, although it is expected to arrive at some point in the near future. Truth Social is a much newer social media network compared to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, and it is one that promises to offer an open platform that doesn\u2019t discriminate against users based on their political ideology. In fact, this political ideology promise is exactly why Truth Social came to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn\u2019t censor its users was advertised as in the works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on iPhone. At the time, Android support was understood to be coming, but there's was\u00a0no clear indication of when. Related:\u00a0Trump's Truth Social Posts On Other Platforms Delay, Explained In terms of Android support, not a lot has actually changed since then, and it remains unknown when Truth Social will be available to download from the Google Play Store. Comments last month from the Truth Social CEO confirmed the app was still en route, explaining that it was waiting on approval from Google before it can be made available via the Play Store. How long that approval process takes typically depends on the app.\nOn February 21, 2022, Truth Social was released on Apple iOS,[98] reaching number one on the App Store's top charts.[99][100] Due to an extensive backlog of applicants, upon downloading the app, about 500,000 people who initially attempted to register as users were automatically waitlisted.[101][102][103]  The app was installed 872,000 times during its first week, but a month later, new user signup had fallen to 60,000 per week. During that time, weekly visits to truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104]  Upon its launch, the British automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its \"T\" logo.[105]  The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post described it as \"a disaster\".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107]  The Truth Social platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the platform's growth.[108][109]\nTruth Social, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform has launched on the App Store, CNET has reported. That confirms a statement from a verified account tied to Truth Social chief product officer \u201cBilly B,\u201d who told people to mark February 21st on their calendars. \u201cWe\u2019re currently set for release in the Apple App Store for Monday, February 21st,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. Incidentally, the 21st marks the Presidents' Day holiday in the US. Provided the network doesn\u2019t suffer a hiccup like the one it did last fall when a prankster claimed the \u201cdonaldjtrump\u201d username and posted an image of defecting pig, the launch will mark Trump\u2019s return to social media. Twitter and Facebook banned the former president following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Before a test version of Truth Social was pulled down last fall, the website\u2019s code showed it ran on a mostly unmodified version of open-source software Mastodon. In October, the Software Freedom Conservancy accused The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) of violating Mastodon\u2019s AGPLv3 license by not sharing the platform\u2019s source code. The website added a dedicated section containing a ZIP archive of its source code two weeks later.Subscribe to the Engadget Deals NewsletterGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\u2019s editorial team.\nSee latestSubscribePlease enter a valid email addressPlease select a newsletterBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy.

Based on the posts seen by Reuters, Truth Social won\u2019t stray too far from the Twitter formula. People can use the network to post \u201cTruths,\u201d the platform\u2019s equivalent to tweets, and it's possible to reshare posts on one's timeline to expand their reach. The executive who answered questions from beta users said the company was working on a verification policy that it would publish \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d He also mentioned TMTG was also working on a direct messaging feature that would come later. Update 2/21/2022 2:28 AM ET: Truth Social has indeed appeared in the iOS App Store, though some users are reportedly having trouble creating accounts, according to CNET. Some are receiving an error message when they try to enter a birthdate, email or phone number, while others say they were placed on a waitlist.

The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.\nBest Picture Drama: \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d Jane Campion\u2019s first film in more than a decade, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d took home the most prestigious award of the night. \u201cPower of the Dog\u201d won Best Picture Drama, Best Director Motion Picture (Jane Campion), and Best Supporting Actor \u2014 Motion Picture (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\u00a0 The acclaimed Netflix drama was the most-nominated movie along with \u201cBelfast,\u201d with each film earning seven nominations.

After a year of controversy about diversity, payola, and improper behavior endemic to the organization that culminated in the Globes losing its NBC broadcast, tonight\u2019s coverage and the subsequent congratulatory marketing from winners will be a good litmus test for if the beleaguered organization can rinse off some of the stink from a year of bad headlines and even more puzzling decisions.

BEIJING \u2014 An Olympic Games beset by COVID-19 concerns, politics, and later tarnished by (another) Russian doping scandal is now over.  After 16 days and 109 events, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics officially ended Sunday with the traditional closing ceremony.  A small, but enthusiastic, group of spectators sat in the stands at Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium during the bitterly cold night in the host city. Some did the wave and cheerfully waved the Chinese flag while waiting for the night's festivities to start. Chinese President Xi Jinping sat next to International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach in the stands, watching the ceremony unfold.

Organizers emphasized snow and ice as the main theme.\nThere were three different clusters of venues designed and constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics, each respectively known as the Beijing Zone, the Zhangjiakou Zone, and the Yanging Zone.[16]  Venues in the Beijing Zone exist in different conditions; some were recently constructed exclusively for the 2022 games, while the rest were renovated from the 2008 Summer Olympics or other existing sites.[17] The Beijing Zone of the 2022 Winter Olympics consisted of six competition venues and was where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, for both the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, would take place.[17]  Five ice events were held at the Olympic Green, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center, which had been some of the main venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\nby Brendan Rourke The opening ceremony for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 featured a snowflake design made with the names of all of the participating countries inside of it.

The Games marked the 24th Winter Olympic Games in history, lasted a total of 17 days, and featured a record 109 events spread over 15 disciplines. Team USA sent a contingent of 224 phenomenal athletes who trained day and night for the opportunity to represent the red, white, and blue. When the Games concluded, Team USA secured 25 medals\u00a0\u2014 eight gold, 10 silver and seven bronze. It was the third-most of any country that participated. Several athletes posted personal bests, and a few even made historical firsts. Throughout the month, Team USA will be posting 12 incredible moments for fans to relive across its social media platforms. Below is a list of those moments in chronological order. Deedra Irwin competes in the women's 15-kilometer individual biathlon during the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 on Feb. 7, 2022 in Zhangjiakou, China.\nThe closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.[60]  The 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports.[61] There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[62]  Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.  In October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing.[63] In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing.\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics (2022\u5e74\u51ac\u5b63\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a), officially called the XXIV Olympic Winter Games (Chinese: \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5c4a\u51ac\u5b63\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a; pinyin: D\u00ec \u00c8rsh\u00eds\u00ec Ji\u00e8 D\u014dngj\u00ec \u00c0ol\u00ednp\u01d0k\u00e8 Y\u00f9nd\u00f2nghu\u00ec) and commonly known as Beijing 2022 (\u5317\u4eac2022), was an international winter multi-sport event held from 4 to 20 February 2022 in Beijing, China, and surrounding areas with competition in selected events beginning 2 February 2022.[1] It was the 24th edition of the Winter Olympic Games.

Defending champions Real Madrid will take on arch-rivals Barcelona in the Supercopa de Espana 2022-23 final at the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Sunday.\u00a0 The Spanish Super Cup, changed from a two-team format to a four-team football tournament in 2019-20, features the winners and runners-up of La Liga and Copa del Rey.\u00a0 Barcelona are the most successful team at the Spanish Super Cup football tournament with 13 titles. However, the Blaugrana have lost six of their seven Super Cup finals against Real Madrid and are still to win a title after the new four-team format was introduced.\u00a0 Real Madrid and Barcelona booked their places for the first El Clasico of 2023 by beating Valencia and Real Betis in the semi-finals, respectively.\u00a0 Real Madrid, who are one shy of equalling Barcelona\u2019s record of 13 Super Cup titles, won their semi-final 4-2 in the penalty shootout after Karim Benzema\u2019s first-half goal from the spot was cancelled out by Valencia in the second-half.\u00a0 Barcelona, meanwhile, took the lead twice against Real Betis through Robert Lewandowski and Ansu Fati but had to win the match through penalties.\n\u201cWe knew it was a chance we had to take, we have lived through an era of changes at the club and in the dressing room, and this will reinforce us to keep fighting for more titles,\u201d said Barca captain Sergio Busquets. \u201cYou know how [Gavi] competes, he\u2019s very young.

The Super Cup used to be played between the Spanish league champion and the Copa del Rey winner. Now the runners-up in both competitions also participate. Madrid played as the league champion and Barcelona as the league runner-up. The current contract to play the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia runs through the 2024-25 season.\nSOCCER The line-up for the 2023 Spanish Super Cup is now set. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s draw with Sevilla on Sunday means Barcelona are guaranteed to finish second in LaLiga and have booked the final available spot in the Super Cup. The tournament will again be played in January in Saudi Arabia, with Bar\u00e7a joined in the Middle East by LaLiga champions Real Madrid, Copa del Rey winners Real Betis and Copa runners-up Valencia. According to Super Cup rules, the holders of the Copa del Rey take on the LaLiga runners-up in the semi-finals, while the league champions face the losing finalists from the Copa. Therefore, Betis will meet Bar\u00e7a in the last four, and Madrid will come up against Valencia. That throws up the possibility of a Cl\u00e1sico in the final, a clash that is yet to occur since the Super Cup\u2019s expansion to a four-team tournament. Bar\u00e7a and Madrid have only met once so far in the revamped Super Cup, in this season\u2019s semi-finals. Los Blancos beat the Blaugrana 3-2, before defeating Athletic Club in the final. This will be Valencia\u2019s second appearance in the Super Cup \u2018final four\u2019, while Betis will be making their debut.

Learn More It's been over a year since Microsoft (MSFT 0.71%) announced it would acquire Activision Blizzard (ATVI -0.01%) in an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion, yet the deal remains uncertain. Activision shares are trading about 24% below its acquisition price of $95 per share.\u00a0 Here's a look at what happened since the deal was announced and whether Activision Blizzard is a buy. The market, fearing antitrust concerns, was skeptical that regulators would approve Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard from the beginning. Activision stock hasn't reached more than $82 per share over the past year and was as low as $71 per share.\nJanuary 18, 2022\t\t\t \t\t\t | Microsoft News Center  REDMOND, Wash. and Santa Monica, Calif. \u2013 Jan. 18, 2022 \u2013 With three billion people actively playing games today, and fueled by a new generation steeped in the joys of interactive entertainment, gaming is now the largest and fastest-growing form of entertainment. Today, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft\u2019s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse. Microsoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard\u2019s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world\u2019s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cDiablo,\u201d \u201cOverwatch,\u201d \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush,\u201d in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. The company has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees.\nWhen the news of the acquisition first broke, in January 2022, Reuters ran the headline \u2018Microsoft to gobble up Activision in a $69 billion metaverse bet\u2018. This was at the height of the metaverse trend and would be the largest gaming industry deal in history. Microsoft is said to have wanted to acquire Activision Blizzard to further improve its presence in the gaming industry, and the metaverse, and to consolidate itself as the de facto king of cloud gaming.\u00a0 With Activision\u2019s titles under its umbrella and with Xbox and its Game Pass and XboX Live platforms to support it, few companies could challenge Microsoft in the gaming field. Acquiring Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft access to multi-million dollar IPs such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and WarCraft franchises, as well as studios such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, at a time when video game IP is proving highly valuable \u2014 just see the success of HBO\u2019s The Last of Us adaptation. The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League. Couple all this with Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal problems and affairs, and the fact that its CEO Bobby Kotick was investigated by the SEC, and one can see what makes the deal appealing to both sides.\nChecking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  In this article Microsoft announced Tuesday it will buy video game giant Activision Blizzard in a $68.7 billion all-cash deal. The price means Microsoft will pay $95 per share for Activision. Activision's stock ended the day up more than 25%, closing at $82.31 per share on Tuesday. Microsoft's shares closed down more than 2%. This would be Microsoft's largest acquisition to date, followed by its purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion. Activision, which is known for popular games such as Call of Duty and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, has been mired in controversy for the last several months after reports of sexual misconduct and harassment among the company's executives.\nThe FTC, after failing to obtain injunctions to block the merger, formally withdrew its challenge in July 2023, and the CMA subsequently agreed to put the case on hold to negotiate with both companies. The deal is now expected to close by October 18, 2023.  Activision Blizzard is one of the largest video game publishers in the world, with annual revenues of about $8.8\u00a0billion in 2021.[1] The company is composed of five business units:[2] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[3] Major League Gaming,[4] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[5][6] Among its assets are ownership of Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro from Activision's studios; Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment; and Candy Crush Saga from King.[7][8]  Microsoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles. In March 2021, Microsoft closed on its acquisition of ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks for an estimated $7.5\u00a0billion, making it one of the largest video game acquisitions by that time.[9]  On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7\u00a0billion in an all-cash deal, or approximately $95 per share.\nQuestion:How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?\nAnswer:"

In order to get your company a spot during the Super Bowl commercials, you must pay a pretty penny. Here's what you need to know about how much Super Bowl commercials cost. MORE:\u00a0The 25 best Super Bowl commercials of all time, ranked NBC, the home for Super Bowl 56, has not reported the official prices for each Super Bowl ad spot, but it was reported back in September by Dan Lovinger of NBC Sports Group\u00a0that the spots were selling quickly and for an upwards of $6.5 million for a 30-second ad. This year's price is the most expensive Super Bowl ad price in NFL history. This price is about a 20 percent increase from the last time NBC hosted the Super Bowl in 2018. The last two Super Bowls, hosted by Fox (2020) and CBS (2021) only saw bids as high as $5.6 million.\nThe pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million \u2013 down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.\u00a0 GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials. AdBlitz already has several 2022 teaser ads to provide a taste of what will be the most expensive advertisement offering ever.\u00a0              Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes.

While millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year\u2019s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let\u2019s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:\u00a0 Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.\nHOLLYWOOD, CA - JANUARY 18: General view of a billboard near Hollywood &amp; Vine featuring the Vince Lombardi Trophy, promoting Super Bowl 56 (Super Bowl LVI) to be held at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on January 18, 2022 in Hollywood, Califo (Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images / Getty Images) The blockbuster price is a first, marking a significant jump in price following a few years of stagnation at around $5.5 million. NBC did not specify the average price, but noted it was a new average with \"multiple\" ads hitting the new peak.\u00a0 SUPER BOWL 2022 TICKET PRICES SOAR, SHOCKING NFL FANS And the price isn\u2019t the only Super Bowl first this year: Frank\u2019s RedHot will try to distinguish itself from the pack with an \"edible\" NFT, and DiGiorno launched a free pizza contest based on the score of the championship game.\u00a0 This photo provided by Cadillac shows a scene from Cadillac's 2021 Super Bowl NFL football spot.

And, although their arrival didn\u2019t elicit violence as it had at other southern universities, it was not easy.\nThe Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage is an international award established in 2010 by the Georgia Institute of Technology[1] in recognition of the late Ivan Allen Jr.  A Georgia Tech alumnus, Allen became a pivotal leader during America's struggle for racial integration during the 1960s. While mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, USA (1962\u20131970), Allen risked his place in society, his political future, and his life when he testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee in support of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[2]  The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage recognizes individuals who, like Mayor Allen, stand up for moral principles and render service to humanity without regard for personal or professional peril. Recipients positively affect public discourse in spite of the risk to their careers, their livelihoods, and even their lives.[3]  The Prize is funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation.  It was awarded for the first time on March 15, 2011, replacing the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service, which had been awarded from 2001\u20132010 to prominent Georgians.[4]  Prominent human rights attorney Beatrice Mtetwa has been named recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr.\nPeterson lauded Nunn for courage and commitment to his own moral compass, for standing up for his beliefs, and for enacting meaningful and sustainable solutions for making the world a better, and more peaceful place.[4]  The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage was established in 2010 by the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The international award honors individuals whose life and work embody the moral courage personified by former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr.[14] The Prize underscores the Institute\u2019s mission to improve the human condition by recognizing those around the globe who, like Mayor Allen, have risked everything to stand up for moral principle and have made a positive difference in the world.[15]  The Prize is funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation.[14]  The prize's forerunner was the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service, which was awarded annually from 2001\u20132010 by the Georgia Tech.[14]  The nominating committee is responsible for assessing candidates who meet the requirements of the prize, demonstrating social courage in adverse circumstances. Each year after deliberation, the committee submits a nominee to the president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who makes the final selection.  Joseph R. Bankoff, Chair, President & CEO, Woodruff Arts Center;  Susan E. Eisenhower, Chairman Emeritus, The Eisenhower Institute, United States Department of Energy, Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future; Dr.\nHouse of Representatives John Lewis, and former U.S. President and Tech alumnus Jimmy Carter, to name a few. While it is a bit unconventional for the nomination committee and Tech President to award the prize to a student of the Institute, it is a timely decision marking 60 years of Black student matriculation at Tech.  The Institute recognizes that its diversity is its strength. Ford Greene, Ralph Long Jr., late Lawrence Williams and Ronald Yancey made great strides during their time at Tech, and their social courage is reflected in the campus atmosphere to this day. Their contributions have paved the way for generations of Black Yellow Jackets.\u00a0 The award symposium honoring the four pioneers will be held on Apr. 20, 2022 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Biltmore Ballroom in Tech Square.\nJanuary 21, 2022 Ford Greene, Ralph Long Jr., and Lawrence Williams, Georgia Tech\u2019s first Black students, and Ronald Yancey, Tech\u2019s first Black graduate, will receive the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.

Previously, the tech giant was in the plan to bring the DayDream VR headsets as well as Google Glasses. Now, the boom of Augmented Reality might have changed the direction of the company to concentrate on the AR world making them join the league after Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. The codename of these new AR headsets is\u00a0Project Iris and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work wirelessly and doesn\u2019t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year\u2019s announced Pixel 6 smartphone.  This Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of \u201cski goggles\u201d with cameras on them which doesn\u2019t require external power. Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101 chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that remotely render graphics. Also Read: 9 Best PS5 Headsets For Amazing Gaming Experience As we have mentioned above the design of the prototype looks like the Ski Goggles; Google has revealed the team working behind the project.\n12]  In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used \"outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world\", internally codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.\n3][4] In May 2019, Google VR/AR head Clay Bavor told CNET that the company was heavily invested in R&D regarding AR devices,[5] while a February 2020 report from The Information revealed that Google had no plans to develop a new pair of augmented reality (AR) smartglasses as of mid-2019, in part due to the highly publicized failure of Glass.[6] In June 2020, Google acquired North, a manufacturer of smartglasses, to assist in its hardware division's vision of ambient computing.[7]  In August 2021, following the announcement that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones would feature the custom-developed Tensor system-on-chip (SoC), Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Business Insider that he believed that Tensor had long-term potential for AR-powered smartglasses,[8] and was echoed by CEO Sundar Pichai in October.[9] In November, a \"Google Labs\" division led by Bavor was created to oversee Google's AR and virtual reality (VR) ventures, unrelated to the defunct service of the same name,[10] while development on an AR operating system began the next month for an unknown \"innovative AR device\", an effort spearheaded by Mark Lucovsky.[11] Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Google was working on a \"new iteration\" of smartglasses as a result of its acquisition of North.\nBesides, the Google Employee\u00a0Clay Bavor that lead the Cardboard; DayDream VR as well as the recent big-time project of the company; Project Starline is working for this upcoming project. Although, the release of this project is slated until 2024 which gives an ample time slot of two years for research and development. The project along with Clay Bavor includes up to 300 more employees working on the Iris AR headsets along with the Google Assistant creator Scott Huffman. Moreover, the list goes on featuring Google AR operating systems senior director Mark Lucovsky; ARCore manager Shahram Izadi, and former light-field camera startup Lytro CTO Kurt Akeley.

Intended to resemble ordinary eyeglasses and for a 2024 release, it was canceled in early 2023.  Following the highly publicized failure of Google Glass smartglasses in 2013, Google executives were initially disinclined to re-enter the field of wearable AR technology. However, by 2021, work had begun on a new AR headset, later reported to be codenamed Project Iris. After going through numerous iterations, Google unveiled a version of Iris at the 2022 Google I/O keynote before publicly testing prototype models later that year. The following year, Google was reported to have abandoned the project in the midst of company-wide layoffs and internal turmoil.  Google first experimented with the prospect of smartglasses with the introduction of Google Glass in 2013.[1] The product was panned by critics due to privacy and ethical concerns,[2] leading Google to discontinue the consumer-facing model and focus on the enterprise model.\nQuestion:What is the codename for Google's AR headset project?\nAnswer:"

Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an \u201cAI supercomputer\u201d \u2014 a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world\u2019s fastest.  \u201cMeta has developed what we believe is the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer,\u201d said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it\u2019ll be complete later this year.\u201d  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own \u201cAI supercomputers,\u201d which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta\u2019s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company\u2019s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse \u2014\u00a0the company\u2019s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.\nMeta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today\u2019s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a \u201cfamily\u201d of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (\u201cInferencing\u201d refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta \u201cTo gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that\u2019s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,\u201d Bjorlin continued. \u201cThis provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.\u201d Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.\nMeta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min) Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta\u2019s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta\u2019s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta\u2019s services today, but also in the metaverse.\nBut Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, \u201cgreatly\u201d increases the company\u2019s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads \u2014 in turn allowing Meta to run \u201cmore enhanced\u201d and \u201ccutting-edge\u201d (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network\u2019s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC \u2014 assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage \u2014 has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there\u2019s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google\u2019s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs \u2014 putting it ahead of Meta\u2019s. Meta\u2019s supercomputer for AI research.

Today, 60% of all students who take the SAT take it for free in their school during the school day. Independent research shows that universal school day testing leads to higher college-going rates for low-income and rural students. Some schools already administer the current version of the SAT digitally for SAT School Day. All schools will start administering the new digital SAT in spring 2024.\u00a0 Going digital means that schools, districts, and states will have more flexibility for where, when, and how often they administer the SAT.  \u00a0  Read more   The digital SAT will be shorter than the current paper and pencil test\u2014around two hours instead of three. It will include two sections (Reading and Writing, Math) with a break in between. Further, the overall test day experience will be shorter since most preadministration activities, such as downloading the exam application and completing the student questionnaire, will happen in advance of test day. Also, testing staff won\u2019t need to spend time handing out, collecting, or sorting test materials.\nWe will continue to provide more information about the transition to the digital SAT Suite of Assessments throughout 2023 and early 2024. We are making a full transition to digital, so once we begin administering the SAT Suite digitally we will no longer offer a paper and pencil version of the tests. Though we will continue to support students who test with accommodations that require a paper and pencil test. That means: \u00a0  Read more   Students will be able to register for the first digital SAT administrations at international test centers starting in fall 2022. We\u2019ll share more information about registration and administration dates later this year. We\u2019re administering the digital SAT first at international test centers in spring 2023. It will then be offered in the U.S. beginning in spring 2024. Most students who take the SAT do so for the first time in the spring of their junior year. So, for students testing internationally, those in the class of 2024 will be the first to take the digital SAT. In the U.S., students in the high school class of 2025 will be the first class to take the digital SAT.\u00a0 Students everywhere will take the digital PSAT 8/9 and PSAT/NMSQT starting in fall 2023.

In November 2021, College Board piloted the digital SAT in the U.S. and internationally; 80% of students responded that they found it to be less stressful and 100% of educators reported having a positive experience. While the transition to digital will bring a number of student- and educator-friendly changes, many important features of the SAT Suite (SAT, PSAT/NMSQT\u00ae, PSAT\u2122 10, PSAT\u2122 8/9) will stay the same. The SAT Suite will continue to measure the knowledge and skills that students are learning in high school and that matter most for college and career readiness. The SAT will still be scored on a 1600 scale, and educators and students can continue to track growth across the SAT Suite of Assessments over time. The assessments will continue to be administered in a school or in a test center with a proctor present\u2014not at home. Students will still have access to free practice resources on Khan Academy.

Beijing was selected as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; taking into account its hosting of the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Beijing is the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics as well as the Summer and Winter Paralympics. This was the overall second Paralympics in China. It was the last of three consecutive Paralympics hosted in East Asia.  These Games featured 564 athletes representing 46 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), competing in 78 medal events across six sports.\nAs part of a formal agreement between the International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee first established in 2001,[6] the winner of the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics was also to host the 2022 Winter Paralympics.[7]  Beijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[7]  The opening ceremony was held on 4 March 2022 at the Beijing National Stadium; it was directed by Zhang Yimou, with the theme \"Blossoming of Life\".[8][9]  During his opening remarks, IPC president Andrew Parsons condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the circumvention of the Olympic Truce by Russia, emphasising that Paralympic athletes compete with, and not \"against\", each other, and that \"the 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate\".[9] The final torchbearer was four-time Chinese para-athletics gold medalist Li Duan, who mounted the torch at the centre of a large snowflake sculpture.[9]  The closing ceremony was held on 13 March 2022.[10] The ceremony closed after nine days of competition and 78 events at the Beijing National Stadium in Beijing, China.[11]\nWhat may be the biggest Paralympic Winter Games in history is coming our way in March 2022. Get up to speed on when they're happening, what sports are being contested and more. The 2022 Winter Paralympics begin on March 4, 2022, and will be shown on NBC, Peacock, USA Network, Olympic Channel, NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app. The 2022 Paralympic Winter Games will take place from Friday, March 4 - Sunday, March 13. The 2022 Winter Paralympics will feature a maximum of 736 Paralympians across 78 medal events. In addition to having 39 medal events for men, 35 events for women and 4 mixed events, there will be a maximum of 222 slots available for women. Paralympians will compete across six different Paralympic sports at the 2022 Winter Paralympics --\u00a0 Alpine Skiing, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing, Sled Hockey, Snowboarding and Wheelchair Curling. Five events are on the Alpine Skiing program (Downhill, Super-G, Super Combined, Giant Slalom, Slalom) across three competition categories (standing, sitting and vision-impaired). Athletes combine speed and agility while racing down slopes at speeds of around 100km/h.\nSeventy-eight events in five sports were held during the 2022 Winter Paralympics, two lower than 2018.[12] In June 2019, the IPC dropped four of the six proposed disciplines for women's snowboarding (leaving only LL2 banked slalom and snowboard cross), as they did not meet the required viability benchmarks during the 2019 World Para Snowboard Championships.[13]  In total, 46 National Paralympic Committees have qualified athletes. Azerbaijan, Israel and Puerto Rico made their Winter Paralympic debut, while Liechtenstein, Estonia, and Latvia returned for the first time since Lillehammer 1994, Salt Lake 2002, and Turin 2006, respectively.[14][15] Seven National Paralympic Committees that participated in PyeongChang 2018 did not send their delegations to Beijing: Armenia, Bulgaria, North Korea, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan.[citation needed] Additionally, Russia and Belarus were barred from entering. A new record of 138 female athletes were scheduled to compete, which was five more than the 133 female athletes in 2018.[15]  On 24 February 2022, the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee condemned the breach of the Olympic Truce (which lasts from the beginning of the Olympics through the end of the Paralympics) by Russia.\nPhoto taken with a mobile phone shows street decorations for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 20, 2022.

The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below\u00a0are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations.

After Super Bowl LV was held in Tampa Bay, where will the NFL\u2019s flagship event be played in 2022, where will it be broadcast, who is performing the halftime show, and which teams are the favorite to square off? For years, the Super Bowl commences on the first Sunday in February. Yet, because money speaks louder than Stephen A. Smith with a microphone, the NFL expanded their season to 17 games. This pushes the league\u2019s premier product to February 13, the latest in the game\u2019s history. SoFi Stadium gets the nod to host the Super Bowl in 2022. SoFi sits in Inglewood, California, with a capacity of 70,000. However, it\u2019s expandable to slightly over 100,000 for large events, such as a Super Bowl. It was supposed to host Super Bowl LV, but construction delays derailed that plan. Although Los Angeles originally won one of the bids from the cluster made available of LIII, LIV, and LV, they couldn\u2019t host in 2021. The three Super Bowl hosts were chosen from a four-candidate pool. However, with the delay, all four locations got a spot.\nThe big game is nearly here.\u00a0 The teams are set as the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams are set to square off for the Lombardi Trophy at Super Bowl LVI.\u00a0 In the AFC Championship, the Bengals fought back after falling behind 21-3 to the Kansas City Chiefs to pull out a 27-24 win in overtime.

The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone. Here's everything you need to know about the big game in 2022, including when Super Bowl 56 will be played.\nMORE SUPER BOWL: Halftime show | Ticket prices | Commercials The Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022. It marks the first time since 2003 that the Super Bowl has not been held on the first Sunday in February. Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held. Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14. NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the \"Sunday Night Football\" crew will presumably broadcast the event.

The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12\u20135 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10\u20137 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.\nThe Lombardi is staying in L.A. \ud83c\udfc6For the first time since 2000, the Rams are #SuperBowl Champions. pic.twitter.com/lbTt1l5gDi February 9, 2022 at 12:15 PM EST The Los Angeles Rams are Super Bowl LVI champions after a 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at SoFi Stadium.

Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam\u2019s biggest hits of 2022, but the game\u2019s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they\u2019ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder\u2019s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You\u2019re still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder\u2019s Pack for the MMO via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the title).\nLost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its decision.[22]  Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game on Steam.[23][24]  In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk\u00a0[zh] to launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has been delayed but not canceled.[26]  Lost Ark received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.[27]  PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, \"Abilities look good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use. You can\u2019t help but feel like a combat god when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.\nLost Ark was originally released in 2019 in South Korea, and has millions of active players in South Korea, Russia, and Japan. It\u2019s free-to-play and has also quickly risen to the top of Twitch, overtaking the popular Just Chatting category.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Sporting the stars and stripes on her hat, arms and legs, Diggins ground her way through the event with no one nearby either ahead or behind; for much of the race, she was at least a minute behind gold medal winner Therese Johaug of Norway, and she was at least a minute ahead of the rest of the pack. Diggins, whose surprise gold in the team sprint in PyeongChang vaulted her to national prominence, was a busy woman at these Games. She competed in all six cross country events, placing top 8 in all of them \u2014 the only woman to pull off that feat \u2014 and in addition to her silver, also won a bronze in the sprint.

I have been trying to be a good all-round athlete my whole life, so this has been really cool.\u201d Diggins finished the final cross-country race of the Beijing Olympics in 1 hour 26 minutes 37 seconds, less than two minutes behind Therese Johaug of Norway and 50 seconds ahead of third-place finisher Kerttu Niskanen of Finland.\n20: Diggins wins her second 2022 Olympic medal. About us Request a correction Submit a tip  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tVTDigger's Brattleboro reporter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Kevin O'Connor\nDiggins took silver in the 30km mass start to become the first American cross-country skier to win two medals at an Olympic Winter Games. Jessie Diggins enhanced her legacy as USA's greatest cross-country skier with silver in the 30km mass start free at Beijing 2022 on Sunday. Diggins, 30, was second to Norway's Therese Johaug, who claimed her third individual title in Beijing, to win her country's 25th and final medal of these Olympic Winter Games. Having already won bronze in the individual sprint, making her USA's first woman to win a medal in cross-country, she became the first American cross-country skier to win two medals at a single Games. It's yet more history for Diggins who also claimed Team USA's first gold in the sport with Kikkan Randall in the PyeongChang 2018 team sprint. Incredibly, she had suffered from food poisoning on the eve of her final event of the Games. She told Olympics.com that she did not carry much confidence into the race, saying, \"If I'm being honest, 24 hours ago I felt really bad and I just laid in bed yesterday mostly and ate food and drank sport drinks. \"But it worked and I think maybe because it's been so cold and so hard, maybe extra rest is what I needed.\" Given that less-than-ideal preparation, it was perhaps no surprise that Diggins collapsed immediately after crossing the line.\nDiggins entered the 2022 Games as a medal favorite, with the eyes of the media creating undeniably feeding external pressure and expectations. To handle these pressures, Diggins\u2019 approach was quite different from the \u201ceye on the prize\u201d medal-focus one might expect. \u201cFor me, it was just important to make sure I could still focus on the process. And so I wasn\u2019t focused on winning, I wasn\u2019t focused on metals, I was just focused on doing my best every single day. So I could come here prepared and happy and in a good place.\u201d And it worked. Click a photo to view as a slideshow. In their first Olympic appearance, Sweden\u2019s Jonna Sundling and Maja Dahlqvist went one-two in the freestyle sprint.\u00a0 For those who have followed the sport over the last Olympic cycle, seeing these women atop the podium was no surprise. The two were partners in the freestyle team sprint during the 2021 World Championships in Oberstdorf, Germany, where they controlled the race from the front, adding a final surge to take the win ahead of Switzerland and Slovenia. This was Dahlqvist\u2019s second World Championship team sprint title; she also won the event in the 2019 World Championships in Seefeld, Austia, racing with Stina Nilsson.\nQuestion:What medals did Jessie Diggins win in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games?\nAnswer:"

Each of its first three seasons (though not as much the fourth) focused on a cat and mouse game that will be very familiar to those who enjoyed The Endgame, as officers of the law matched wits with formidable criminal minds that were willing and able to commit acts of great cruelty and malice. Like other great crime dramas, the series excelled at showing the sinister side of the human condition. The iconic\u00a0Kevin Bacon has been in many great movies and TV series, and The Following is one of those. Like The Endgame, the series focuses on a cat and mouse game between an FBI agent and a sinister figure, in this case, Joe Carroll, a charismatic serial killer.\nThe show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O\u2019Neil (played by the dashing Dougray Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles \u2013 and maybe even the world \u2013 had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood\u2019s elite to notice the elaborate heist unfold. \u00a0  NBC\u2019s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bath\u00e9, The Endgame follows Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why. But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena\u2019s ambitious plan and discover what her endgame is. \u00a0  The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted TV show is watching it unfold knowing it\u2019s completely based on real-life events. That\u2019s exactly the case with ITV\u2019s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton Garden, London.\nIt\u2019s a violent and disturbing series, made all the more so by the fact that James Purefoy makes it very believable that someone like Carroll would command such devout and dangerous loyalty from those who essentially worship him. The Fall is yet another series that focuses its story on a battle of wits between law enforcement and a serial killer. What\u2019s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who\u00a0exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there\u2019s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It\u2019s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI. Those who enjoy that particular aspect of the series will also find much to like about Quantico.\nThose who enjoy the cat and mouse thriller The Endgame will be glad to know that there are a number of other similar television shows. The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It\u2019s actually easy to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED:\u00a010 Thriller Movies With The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, constantly wondering just what\u2019s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries) will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It\u2019s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There\u2019s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader\u2019s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles. American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.\nThe Endgame is an American crime drama thriller television series that premiered on NBC on February 21, 2022. The series is created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn.[1][2] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[3]  In this heist drama, criminal mastermind Elena Federova squares off against principled FBI agent Val Turner.[4]  On April 21, 2021, The Untitled Nick Wootton/Jake Coburn Project was given a pilot order by NBC. It was created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn who were expected to executive produce alongside Julie Plec and Emily Cummins. Wootton also wrote the pilot.[5] On September 21, 2021, NBC ordered The Endgame to series. Justin Lin and Andrew Schneider were added as executive producers. Lin also directed the pilot. Universal Television, Nicholas Wootton Productions, Jake Coburn Productions, Inc., My So-Called Company, and Perfect Storm Entertainment are the production companies involved with producing the series.[1] Upon the series order, Morena Baccarin, Ryan Michelle Bath\u00e9, Kamal Angelo Bolden, Costa Ronin, Noah Bean, Jordan Johnson-Hinds, and Mark D. Espinoza were cast in starring roles.[6] On November 18, 2021, Karl Josef Co and Massiel Mordan were added to the cast.\nQuestion:What is the genre of The Endgame (TV show)?\nAnswer:"

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.\nHe falsely claimed they had been \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime\".[74] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[75] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine.[76] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[75] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[77] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[78] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[79]  The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[72] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[80][81] which reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40\u00a0a.m. Kyiv time.\nNortheastern Ukraine campaign  Eastern Ukraine campaign  Southern Ukraine campaign  2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive  Other regions  Naval operations  Spillover and cross-border incidents  Resistance  Related  Attacks on civilians  On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014. The invasion has killed tens of thousands on both sides. Russian forces have been responsible for mass civilian casualties and for torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers. By June 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced. More than 8.2\u00a0million had fled the country by May 2023, becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage, widely described as ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.  Prior to the invasion, Russian troops concentrated near Ukraine's borders, as Russian officials denied plans to attack. Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces were fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict, claiming the goal was to \"demilitarise\" and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the ethnic Russian minority.\n[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]\n(GRIGORY SYSOYEV/AFP/Getty Images) Early in 2021, Zelenskyy cracked down on pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs, including Viktor Medvedchuk, a close friend of Putin. Subsequently, Putin deploys increasing numbers of troops near the Ukrainian border and publishes an article claiming that Russians and Ukrainians are \u201cone people.\u201d By December, tens of thousands of Russian troops are deployed to the borders and Putin issues demands to NATO and the United States. Among these demands is that Ukraine never be admitted to NATO \u2013 a request rejected by the Biden administration.\u00a0 (Vadim Ghirda/AP) In 2014, the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk broke away from Ukraine, under the leadership of what the Ukrainian government considered to be Russian-backed terrorists. Following the breakdown of relations with NATO and the West in late February, Putin recognized these territories as independent states and sent troops in to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d (Emilio Morenatti/AP) Days after recognizing the breakaway territories, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in the eastern Ukrainian territory of Donbas. Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine and officially broke diplomatic ties with Russia. Putin\u2019s actions were condemned across the world and within Russia. The Associated Press After months of Russian encroachment, Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian military back, reclaiming over a thousand square miles.\nQuestion:When did Russia invade Ukraine?\nAnswer:"

This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5) to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments.

Gold: 16Silver: 8Bronze: 13Total: 37 Gold: 6Silver: 12Bronze: 14Total: 32 Gold: 12Silver: 10Bronze: 5Total: 27 Gold: 4Silver: 8Bronze: 14Total: 26 Gold: 8Silver: 10Bronze: 7Total: 25 When it came to which countries won the most medals overall, Norway came in first. The Russian Olympic Committee (the unofficial team representing Russia's athletes) came in second with 32 medals. In third place was Germany, with 27 medals. Canada was next with 26 medals, and the US trailed behind with 25 medals.\nWith all 109 medal events decided, competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing is officially complete.\u00a0 After three weeks of dominance, Norway stands alone atop the chart with the most total medals (37) and the most gold medals (16). Norway broke its own record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 16, to go along with eight silver medals and 13 bronze medals. (Norway and Germany in 2018 both matched the record of 14 gold medals at a single Winter Olympics previously set by Canada in Vancouver 2010.) Norway narrowly missed eclipsing its high-water mark of 39 total medals, won in PyeongChang. The United States finished the Games with eight gold medals -- tied for the fourth most along with Sweden and the Netherlands. But America's total medal count of 25 put them fifth. In addition to eight golds, the U.S. tallied 10 silver medals and seven bronze medals. [RELATED: 2022 Winter Olympics medal count] The ROC finished second with 32 total medals (6 gold, 12 silver, 14 bronze). Germany, after absolutely dominating the sliding sports with gold medals in nine out of 10 events, slotted third with 27 total medals (12 gold, 10 silver, 5 bronze). And Canada eclipsed the U.S. for fourth with 26 total medals (4 gold, 8 silver, 14 bronze).\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their country\u2019s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in Winter Olympics history before the start of the 2022 Winter Games:  Total: 130 Gold: 45 Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC Silver: 44 Bronze: 41 Medals won in PyeongChang: 20 Sport with most medals: Speed skating (121) Dutch speed skaters famously take the ice wearing orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland\u2019s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country\u2019s haul in its top summer sport, swimming (62).\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91 nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines.[1][2]  Overall 29 nations received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Norway won the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games.[3] Host nation China won nine gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition.[4] Athletes from that nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter editions.[5]  Biathletes Johannes Thingnes B\u00f8, Quentin Fillon Maillet, and Marte Olsbu R\u00f8iseland, and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov won the most total medals at the games with five each.[6] B\u00f8 also earned the most gold medals with four.[7] Snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation.\nThe 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold medals.\u00a0 After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix, France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case. The U.S. finished second with Japan in third and Canada in fourth.\u00a0            Note: Some components of NBCOlympics.com may not be optimized for users browsing with           Internet           Explorer 11, 10 or older browsers or systems.          \u00a9 2022 NBC Universal.

The night\u2019s top honor, Entertainer of the Year, went to Luke Combs for the second time. He also was awarded his second Album of the Year trophy for Growin\u2019 Up. Chris Stapleton took home his sixth Male Vocalist of the Year honor, making him the fifth most-winning artist in CMA Awards history behind Brooks & Dunn, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson and George Strait. He also became the most-winning artist in the Male Vocalist category. Lainey Wilson, the first-time honoree who was the most-nominated artist of the evening, won New Artist of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year, joining Alison Krauss and Carrie Underwood as the only other artist to win both Female Vocalist and New Artist in a single year. Jordan Davis took home Song of the Year for his duet with CMA host Luke Bryan, \u201cBuy Dirt.\u201d Davis co-wrote the hit with his brother Jacob Davis and another set of hit-making brothers Josh and Matt Jenkins. Single of the Year went to Cody Johnson for \u201c\u2018Til You Can\u2019t,\u201d who also took home the award for Music Video of the Year for the tune prior to the telecast. Brothers Osborne won Vocal Duo of the Year for the sixth time. Old Dominion took home Vocal Group of the Year for the fifth time.\nThe following list shows the recipients for the Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year.[1] This Award goes to the artist. The Award is based on individual musical performance on a solo Country single or album release, as well as the overall contribution to Country Music.[2] This award was one of the original awards given at the first ceremony in 1967.   The inaugural recipient of the award was Jack Greene in 1967. Chris Stapleton holds the record for most wins in the category, with six, while five-time recipient George Strait has a leading twenty-five nominations. Dierks Bentley and Eric Church holds the record for most nominations without a win, with nine each. The current holder of the award is Stapleton, who won at the 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards in 2022.  In CMA history only thirteen men have won Male Vocalist of the Year the very first time they were nominated. They are:\nChris Stapleton won the trophy for Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 CMA Awards, beating out fellow nominees\u00a0Eric Church,\u00a0Luke Combs,\u00a0Cody Johnson\u00a0and\u00a0Morgan Wallen.\u00a0 Visibly moved by the win, Stapleton used the opportunity to share his appreciation with those who have supported his career through the years. \"This is a dream every minute we get to live this,\" he told the crowd during his acceptance speech. \"I'm evidence that dreams come true all the time, so thank you, thank you to everybody.\" Stapleton's Wednesday night win marks the second consecutive year that he has won the Male Vocalist of the Year trophy, and his sixth win in the category overall. From 2015 to 2018, the singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and 2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day. Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his late 2020 project, Starting Over. The 2022 CMA Awards aired live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena on ABC.\nThe honor is Pearce's third CMA win and McBryde's second; it could be the first in a big night for \"Never Wanted To Be That Girl\" \u2014 the track also earned Song of the Year and Single of the Year nominations.

State ACC baseball title game matchup ended when Vance Honeycutt\u2019s first home run landed on West 4th Street. When his second home run landed in almost the same spot, it was celebration time for the Tar Heels, sadness for the Wolfpack. North Carolina defeated N.C. State, 9-5, to win the 2022 ACC tournament title Sunday, the eighth title in school history and first for the Tar Heels since 2019. Carolina won three straight ACC tournament titles from 1982-84 and won it again in 1990 before adding championships in 2007 and 2019. Scott Forbes, the Tar Heels\u2019 second-year skipper, won a championship in his first attempt. The title still eludes N.C.

This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple\u2019s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.\nYear introduced: 2022 Capacity:\u00a0128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Colors:\u00a0Midnight, starlight,\u00a0(PRODUCT)RED,\u00a0blue, purple,\u00a0yellow Model numbers:\u00a0A2649 (United States, Puerto Rico), A2881 (Canada, Guam, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Virgin Islands),\u00a0A2884 (China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao), A2883 (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia), A2882 (other countries and regions) Details: The\u00a0iPhone 14 has a 6.1 inch1\u00a0all-screen Super Retina XDR display.

What about the iPhone 14 chip? As it turns out, things are going to be interesting this year. The iPhone 14 chip will be different than the iPhone 14 Pro chip for the first time. As a quick refresher, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to consist of four different devices across two different screen sizes. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will feature a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature a 6.7-inch display.  This will mark the first time that Apple has offered a non-Pro version of the iPhone with a 6.7-inch display. But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won\u2019t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.  According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max chip won\u2019t get an upgrade this year.\nLearn how to identify your iPhone model by its model number and other details.

This year's show was held on 10 May 2023 as a hybrid event with a limited live audience and online access for everyone. Here's everything you need to know about Google I/O 2023. Google I/O is an annual developer conference hosted by Google, where the company showcases its latest technologies and products. The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch.

China\u2019s first Mars rover will be named Zhurong after a traditional fire god, the government announced Saturday. The rover is aboard the Tianwen-1 probe that arrived in Mars orbit on February 24 and is due to land in May to look for evidence of life.  It is part of Chinese space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon. China in 2019 became the first country to land a space probe on the little-explored far side of the moon and in December returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s. The rover\u2019s title fits with the Chinese name for Mars \u2014 \u201cHuo Xing,\u201d or fire star, the China National Space Administration said. The name \u201csignifies igniting the flame of China\u2019s planetary exploration,\u201d a deputy CNSA administrator, Wu Yanhua, was cited by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying.\nOn 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site. It was the first public appearance of China's Mars exploration mission.[46]  As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was formally named \"Tianwen-1\".[47]  On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22]  In September 2020, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed the Tianwen-1 First Deployable Camera (TDC-1), a small satellite with two cameras that took photos of and tested a radio connection with Tianwen-1.[10] Its mission was to photograph the Tianwen-1 orbiter and the lander's heat shield.[10] Due to the time when it was deployed, it trajectory predicted to do a flyby of Mars with that happening around the orbit insertion date.  During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.\nA probe would be sent to Martian orbit and attempt to land on Mars in 2020.[15]  On 23 August 2016, CNSA revealed the first images of the final version of the Mars mission spacecraft, which confirmed the composition of a Mars orbiter, lander, and rover in one mission.[16]  The scientific objectives and payloads of the Mars mission were declared in a paper published in Journal of Deep Space Exploration in December 2017.[17]  On 24 April 2020, China's interplanetary exploration program was formally announced by CNSA, along with the name Tianwen and an emblem of the program.[18] The first mission of the program, the Mars mission to be carried out in 2020, was named Tianwen-1.[19]  On 24 April 2021, in anticipation of the upcoming landing attempt, CNSA formally announced that the rover would be named Zhurong (Chinese: \u795d\u878d\u53f7).[20]  Mockup of the Zhurong rover at the 69th International Astronautical Congress  Full-scale mockup of Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander.  Artist's Rendering of Tianwen-1 mission components  To design and test the rover and simulate conditions at Utopia Planitia, CNSA kept a test bed rover in a Mars yard at the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing.\n39][40] Tianwen-1's rover is named Zhurong (Chinese: \u795d\u878d\u53f7), after a Chinese mytho-historical figure usually associated with fire and light.[41] The name was chosen through an online poll held from January to February 2021.[42]  China's Mars program started in partnership with Russia. In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]\nOn December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year. In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: \u5929\u95ee\u4e00\u53f7)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c.\u00a0340\u2013278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.\nQuestion:What is the name of China's rover on Mars?\nAnswer:"

Named after WWE Hall of Famer The Ultimate Warrior, The Warrior Award is presented to an individual who has exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of The Ultimate Warrior. The news was first reported by Foxsports.com. The Warrior Award presentation will be part of the WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Friday, April 1, at American Airlines Center in Dallas as part of WrestleMania Week. The event will stream live exclusively on Peacock in the U.S. and WWE Network everywhere else. A larger-than-life Superstar with boundless charisma, Shad passed away on May 17, 2020. While swimming with his son, the pair got caught in a strong current in Venice Beach, Cal. In a heroic act of love, the concerned father instructed lifeguards to save his son before himself and disappeared soon after. Days later, his passing was confirmed. He was 39 years old. Shad\u2019s bravery and selflessness will be honored next Friday with the 2022 Warrior Award as part of the 2022 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. WWE Global Ambassador Titus O\u2019Neil has been named the recipient of the 2020 Warrior Award.

The former wrestler will be recognized for his heroic efforts ... and will receive one of WWE's most prestigious awards during WrestleMania weekend. The Warrior Award was introduced in 2015 -- it was named after WWE Hall of Famer, Ultimate Warrior -- and is presented to an individual who has exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance. UPDATE: officials confirm description of pro wrestler Shad Gaspard matches that of the body discovered after washing up on shore in Venice Beach. @FOXLA @GDLA @LACoLifeguards \ud83d\udc94 pic.twitter.com/1EGKkglcNf The award is reserved for an individual who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior, one of the most popular wrestlers to step foot in a ring. 39-year-old Gaspard personified those traits ... especially in the waning moments of his life. As we previously reported, the wrestler was swimming with his 10-year-old son near Venice Beach in L.A. when a strong rip current engulfed the two. Lifeguards were able to locate Gaspard and his son, but he told them to focus on getting his son to shore safely.\nQuestion:Who is being honored with the 2022 Warrior Award?\nAnswer:"

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won\u2019t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I\u2019ll often refer to it as having a \u201claptop cart\u201d look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.\u00a0 With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company\u2019s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It\u2019s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see appealing to adults in the consumer space.\u00a0 If it weren\u2019t so dang slow.\u00a0 I\u2019m not gonna hold back here: this is the slowest computer I\u2019ve ever used.\nAccessories  The Surface Laptop SE is a laptop computer manufactured by Microsoft. Unveiled on November 9, 2021, it is an entry-level model in the Surface Laptop series positioned exclusively towards the education market. It was released on 9 November 2021.  The Surface Laptop SE has a plastic body and shares some components (such as the keyboard) with the Surface Laptop Go. Microsoft stated that it was designed to be more repairable than other Surface models, with replacement parts (such as batteries, displays, keyboards, and motherboards) to be available through its service partners for on-site repairs.[1][2]  The device uses an Intel Celeron CPU, with configurations using either a Celeron N4020 with 4\u00a0GB of RAM and 64\u00a0GB of internal storage, or the N4120 with 8\u00a0GB of RAM and 128\u00a0GB of internal storage. It has two USB ports, one of which is USB-C. Unlike other Surface models, the Laptop SE uses a round, non-magnetic power connector. It includes a 10.1-inch screen at 1366\u00d7768 resolution, and a one-megapixel webcam.[1][3]  It ships with Windows 11 SE, a variant of the operating system with optimizations for the education market.[3][4]\nQuestion:What is the weight of the Surface Laptop SE?\nAnswer:"

Her work has previously appeared in BuzzFeed, Cosmopolitan, Elle, and Esquire.\nPeter Debruge of Variety said, \"The result can feel a little rickety in places, but the Nee brothers \u2014 who share screenplay credit with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox \u2014 have punched it up with off-color jokes, looped over moments when the characters' mouths are off-camera. In this and myriad other ways, The Lost City proves they do in fact make 'em like they used to.\"[40] Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fear said \"The movie itself is trying to excavate a long-lost genre: the big-budget action-adventure movie-star rom-com. It wants to be a modern Romancing the Stone so badly you can almost see the flop-sweat dripping down the screen.\"[41]\nWhen co-director-writers Adam and Aaron Nee set out to make their film The Lost City, they put their actors through their own jungle misadventure. \"Sandy, I remember early on putting you and Channing in the ocean, surrounded by jellyfish, and feeling like we were going to lose our actors in week one,\" Adam says of stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. The Lost City follows Bullock's Loretta, a successful but blocked romance novelist who, during her latest book tour with her handsome cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), gets swept up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them both in a jungle chase. During EW's\u00a0Around the Table with the cast \u2014 including Bullock, Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, and Patti Harrison \u2014 the directors likened shooting in the jungles of the Dominican Republic to \"a crazy, zany time.\" Tatum and Bullock weren't the only ones the Nee brothers worried about scaring off. Recalling Radcliffe's early days on set as the film's eccentric billionaire villain Abigail Fairfax, Aaron recalled, \"I think Adam and I thought, 'Oh no, we've just gotten Daniel here and we're going to throw him in the ocean.'\" Or, as Bullock puts it, \"And now, we're going to kill him.\nThe Lost City features Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, and Daniel Radcliffe, among a few other actors. Check out some fun facts about the cast. The 2022 film The Lost City is the perfect combination of comedy, adventure, romance, and an incredibly talented cast capable of pulling off any role. This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors. The Lost City was released in March 2022 and quickly became a box office hit.\nThe Lost City - Cr.

Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps\u00a0\u2013 though the moment\u00a0was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened\u00a0since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.\u00a0 \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.\n\"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he said.   For more on the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident at the Oscars, listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.   The debacle at Sunday's awards show unraveled after Rock made light of Jada's hair loss, which she's recently opened up about as a result of her years-long struggle with alopecia. \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see ya,\" he joked.   Will, 53, then walked onto stage and smacked Rock in the face, leaving the audience and live viewers around the world stunned. \"Oh wow,\" said a seemingly taken-aback Rock as Will made his way back to his seat. \"Will Smith just smacked the s\u2014 out of me.\"   \"Keep my wife's name out your f\u2014ing mouth!\" Smith yelled up to the stage at Rock after taking his seat again.   \"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,\" said Rock \u2014 to which Smith replied once again, \"Keep my wife's name out your f\u2014ing mouth!\"   \"I'm going to, okay?\" Rock replied, before going on to say, \"That was the ... greatest night in the history of television\" and presenting the award.\nAfter the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it \u201cdoes not condone violence of any form.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. \u201cThe incident involved one individual slapping another,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.\u201d \u201cThat was the greatest night in the history of television,\u201d Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs \u2014 on stage to introduce a tribute to \u201cThe Godfather\u201d \u2014 tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. \u201cWill and Chris, we\u2019re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,\u201d Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few \u2014 if anyone \u2014 wanted to discuss. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that,\u201d said Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, the director of \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith\u2019s milestone accomplishment.\nFiled under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. \u201cI did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,\u201d marveled Diddy shortly after. \u201cThis action we are taking today in response to Will Smith\u2019s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,\u201d the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. \u201cWe also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.\u201d Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, \u201cI accept and respect the Academy\u2019s decision.\u201d Here\u2019s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.\nDuring the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.\nQuestion:What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?\nAnswer:"

The Apple M2 is the latest processor designed for Macs, and marks a second generation for Apple Silicon processors.  The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn\u2019t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU. You\u2019ll need to pay an extra \u00a3100 if you want the 10-core GPU.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.\nText of this article June 6, 2022 PRESS RELEASE Apple unveils M2, taking the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further M2 delivers new levels of power-efficient performance and capabilities to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA\u00a0Apple today announced M2, beginning the next generation of Apple silicon designed specifically for the Mac.\u00a0Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35 percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1 It also delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory. M2 brings all of this \u2014 plus new custom technologies and greater efficiency \u2014 to the completely redesigned\u00a0MacBook Air\u00a0and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro.\u00a0 \u201cM2 starts the second generation of M-series chips and goes beyond the remarkable features of M1,\u201d said Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. \u201cWith our relentless focus on power-efficient performance, M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. And along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like ProRes acceleration, M2 continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac.\nApple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]\nApple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1 chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.\nQuestion:When did Apple M2 chip?\nAnswer:"

By Gabe Cohn The 94th Academy Awards were held on Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. \u201cCODA,\u201d a relatively small-scale drama once considered an underdog, won the award for best picture, becoming the first film distributed by a streaming service to win Hollywood\u2019s top honor. (\u201cCODA\u201d was released by Apple TV+, which purchased the movie after it played at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.)

The awards were scheduled after their usual late February date to avoid conflicting with both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI, with the latter being held in nearby Inglewood, California.[3] During the gala, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories honoring films released from March 1 to December 31, 2021. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Will Packer and Shayla Cowan and was directed by Glenn Weiss.[4] Actresses Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes hosted the show for the first time.[5] Two days earlier, in an event held at the Ray Dolby Ballroom of the Ovation Hollywood complex in Hollywood, the Academy held its 12th annual Governors Awards ceremony.[6]  CODA won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Dune with six awards, The Eyes of Tammy Faye with two, and Belfast, Cruella, Drive My Car, Encanto, King Richard, The Long Goodbye, No Time to Die, The Power of the Dog, The Queen of Basketball, Summer of Soul, West Side Story and The Windshield Wiper with one.\nQuestion:When will the 94th Academy Awards be held?\nAnswer:"

Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]  The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day.\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. The final took place in front of 88,966 supporters, with a record crowd of 1.5 billion people watching on television, becoming one of the most widely-watched televised sporting events in history.[3]  The tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2\u20131, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2\u20130. They then won against Australia in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out, and Croatia in the semi-final. France finished top of Group D with two wins and one loss (4\u20131 win over Australia, 2\u20131 win over Denmark, and a 1\u20130 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final and Morocco in the semi-final.\n371] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[372] to avoid the summer heat between May and September and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[373][374]  The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup\u2122 in Qatar is the 22nd edition of the biggest sporting event on the planet.

The United States Men\u2019s National Team was drawn to Group B.\n239] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2\u20131 by virtue of goals from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[240][241]  The semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December.[31] Messi scored a penalty kick before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3\u20130 victory over Croatia, their biggest win margin in the 2022 tournament, reaching their sixth final and first since 2014.[242] Th\u00e9o Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game.

The company produced 4,641 fewer cars than it delivered during the quarter citing \"ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.\" Analysts expected deliveries of 317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31.\nThe first-quarter deliveries compare with analyst expectations of 430,008 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data based on seven analysts. According to a mean of estimates compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries of around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported. Tesla missed the figure analysts surveyed by Refinitiv and FactSet were expecting. Other estimates show Tesla beat Wall Street expectations with its 422,875 vehicles delivered. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 421,164 vehicles would be shipped. Tesla said a consensus of more than 20 analysts called for 421,500 vehicles delivered, Tesla investor Gary Black said in a tweet. Reuters could not independently confirm that figure. The consensus is \"all over the place,\" Munster said. Tesla delivered 6% more of its mainstay Model 3/Model Y vehicles in the first three months of this year than in the previous quarter. But the number of deliveries for its higher-priced Model X/Model S vehicles slumped by 38%.

Deliveries reached another quarterly record, while the production was at a near-record level. That's outstanding news considering how challenging the global economy and automotive industry is in particular. In this post, we will take a look at the numbers and charts to visualize the progress and better understand what can be achieved in the near future. Let's get into details. Tesla increased its overall electric car production in Q1 by about 69% year-over-year to 305,407, just a few hundred units below the record of 305,407 set in Q4 2021. The lion's share falls on the Model 3/Model Y - over 291,000. Another bit of positive news is that the production of the refreshed Model S/Model X further increased compared to Q4. The preliminary sales result (customer deliveries) was at a record high of 310,048 (up 68% year-over-year). The Model 3/Y reached an all-time record, while the Model S/X pair improved towards the levels seen in the previous years. Q1 2022 (YOY change) \"In the first quarter, we produced over 305,000 vehicles and delivered over 310,000 vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.\" During the past four quarters, Tesla produced and delivered more than 1 million electric cars.\nQuestion:How many vehicles did Tesla deliver in the first quarter of 2022?\nAnswer:"

(NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction.

Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.\nAdvisorsGoldman Sachs & Co.

Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover.  The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as \"merger effective\". Allow Twitter content?

Chief financial officer Ned Segal, and the firm's top legal and policy executive, Vijaya Gadde, are leaving alongside Mr Agrawal, according to US media reports.  Twitter co-founder Biz Stone appeared to confirm the executives' departure.\n161][162] In a video call with banks who helped Musk fund the acquisition, Musk assured them he would complete the buyout by the deadline.[163] Musk made a trip to Twitter's headquarters on October 26, tweeting a video of him carrying a kitchen sink at the site's lobby and changing his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\".[164][165][166] Musk also told Twitter employees that while layoffs were still likely to happen, he did not intend to do so at the scale the Post had previously reported.[167][168] The next day, Musk wrote in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would not become a \"free-for-all hellscape\", reiterating that his motives for the purchase were not based on greed but rather a desire to create \"a common digital town square\".[169] He then asked Tesla engineers to meet with Twitter's product managers in order to assess the platform's codebase,[170] which was frozen until November 1.[171]  In the afternoon of October 27, Musk and Twitter closed the deal, with Musk tweeting \"the bird is freed\". Musk immediately became Twitter's new owner, promptly firing Agrawal, chief financial officer (CFO) Ned Segal, Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett,[172][173][174] with the executives escorted out of the company's headquarters by security.\nAdvertisement The world\u2019s richest man closed his blockbuster purchase of the social media service, thrusting Twitter into a new era. By Kate Conger and Lauren Hirsch Kate Conger reports on technology from San Francisco and Lauren Hirsch reports on mergers and acquisitions from New York. After months of waffling, lawsuits, verbal mudslinging and the near miss of a full blown trial, Elon Musk now owns Twitter. On Thursday night, Mr. Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy the social media service, said three people with knowledge of the situation. He also began cleaning house, with at least four top Twitter executives \u2014 including the chief executive and chief financial officer \u2014 getting fired on Thursday. Mr. Musk had arrived at Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Wednesday and met with engineers and ad executives. The closing of the deal, which followed months of drama and legal challenges as Mr. Musk changed his mind about buying the company, sets Twitter on an uncertain course. Mr. Musk, a self-described \u201cfree speech absolutist,\u201d has said that he wants to make the social media platform a more freewheeling place for all types of commentary and that he would \u201creverse the permanent ban\u201d of former President Donald J. Trump from the service. Mr. Musk\u2019s open approach to speech on Twitter could exacerbate long simmering issues of toxic content and misinformation, affecting political debates around the world.\nQuestion:Who acquired Twitter?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.\nApril 25 \u2013 Twitter accepts Musk's offer to acquire the company and values the deal at $44 billion, according to an announcement from the company. April 29 \u2013 Over a three-day period after Musk and Twitter reach a deal, and he sells about $8.5 billion worth in Tesla stock to help finance the bid. May 4 \u2013 Musk secures more than $7 billion in financing for the deal, including commitments from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and cryptocurrency exchange Binance, according to a securities filing. May 6 \u2013 In a pitch deck for investors, Musk says he will quintuple Twitter's revenue by 2028, increasing annual earnings to $26.4 billion, the New York Times reports. May 10 \u2013 Musk says he would reverse Twitter's ban of the account that belongs to former President Donald Trump. The remarks from Musk were made virtually at an auto conference. May 12 \u2013 Twitter announces a temporary hiring freeze, pending Musk's acquisition; and two top executives leave the company. May 13 \u2013 Musk tweets that the Twitter deal is \"temporarily on hold,\" \u200b\u200bciting concern over what he says is the prevalence of bot and spam accounts on the platform. Along with his tweet, Musk posts a Reuters report about a public filing from Twitter earlier in May that said fake accounts made up less than 5% of users on the platform.\nOct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted. But Musk provided little clarity on how he will achieve his goals.  read more Earlier this month, Musk brought the deal back on the table after previously trying to walk away from it. Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.\n50][51] Agrawal was set to receive $39\u00a0million from the buyout, while Dorsey would receive $978\u00a0million.[52] Musk had privately selected a new CEO to replace Agrawal upon completion of the acquisition,[35] though he was expected to serve as interim CEO in the months after its completion.[53] Tesla's stock sank by more than $125\u00a0billion the next market day, causing Musk to lose about $30\u00a0billion of his net worth.[54][55]  After the acceptance was announced, Musk said that his first goal would be to make the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed open-sourced, in an effort to increase transparency. He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[56] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[57][58] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[59] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[35] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[60] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[61][62] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[63] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[64][65]\nMusk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.\nQuestion:How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?\nAnswer:"

There were 52 golfers who made the weekend with an opportunity to play for a green jacket, major championship and significant check, yet it was 36- and 54-hole leader Scottie Scheffler who made history by claiming the first major title of his career.  Scheffler finished 1 under Sunday and 10 under for the Masters, edging second-place finisher Rory McIlroy on the Masters leaderboard by three strokes. McIlroy scored the round of the tournament with an 8-under 64, matching the lowest final-round score in Masters history. While he did fall short of the career grand slam, McIlroy nevertheless captured a lot of cash on Sunday.  The 2022 Masters purse was set at a record $15 million, paying out a total of $3.5 million more than it has in any prior edition of the tournament. Scheffler will bring home 18% of that sum ($2.\nThe 2022 Masters Tournament was the 86th edition of the Masters Tournament, the first of the four major golf championships of 2022, held April 7\u201310 at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.  For the first time since the 2019 tournament, attendance returned to full capacity with maximum of 40,000 spectators per day; the traditional par-3 contest also returned.[1][2]  Scottie Scheffler won his first major by three strokes over Rory McIlroy.[3][4] Scheffler had achieved his first PGA Tour win at the WM Phoenix Open two months earlier, and after also winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational and WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play he entered the Masters as world number one.[5]  Scheffler led by a record-tying five strokes after the second round, and held the lead from then on. His main challenger was Cameron Smith, who narrowed the lead to one stroke after the second hole of the final round. On the subsequent hole, Scheffler and Smith found themselves in the same tricky position, with Scheffler chipping in for a birdie, and Smith only managing a bogey, extending the lead to 3 strokes. Smith made a triple bogey on the 12th hole after his ball went into the water, leaving Scheffler relatively unchallenged for the rest of the round.\nEntering the final round 10 strokes back from Scheffler, Rory McIlroy shot a 8-under-par 64 to finish second, his best major finish since 2014. Much attention was given to Tiger Woods, who made his first PGA Tour start since the 2020 Masters after suffering severe injuries to his right leg and ankle in a February 2021 car accident. Woods made the cut and finished the tournament 47th, visibly limping for much of the last two rounds. Defending champion Hideki Matsuyama finished tied for 14th.[6]  There was no winner of the Silver Cup (prize for low amateur), as no amateur made the cut. This year's purse was increased over thirty percent to $15 million, with a winner's share of $2.7 million.  Participation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only,[9] and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships.[10] There are a number of criteria by which invites were awarded, including all past winners, recent major champions, leading finishers in the previous years' majors, leading players on the PGA Tour in the previous season, winners of full-point tournaments on the PGA Tour during the previous 12 months, leading players in the Official World Golf Ranking and some leading amateurs.[11]  This list details the qualification criteria for the 2022 Masters Tournament and the players who qualified under them; any additional criteria under which players qualified is indicated in parentheses.\nScottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta National.            The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major title.            After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of second-placed McIlroy.            Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia, Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the tournament\u2019s leader for nearly three days.            In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse.            Asked how he felt in the immediate aftermath, Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty tired.\u201d           \u201cI want to go home! I\u2019m pretty tired right now \u2013 I\u2019m really at a loss for words right now,\u201d he said.           \u201cI can\u2019t thank my family enough \u2013 they\u2019ve made many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family with me was incredible.\u201d           The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Masters Tournament?\nAnswer:"

PREVIEW (via Reuters) Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina began her Australian Open campaign on the outer courts at Melbourne Park but the 22nd seed is now just one step away from winning her second major, with only fellow big-hitter Aryna Sabalenka standing in her way. Russian-born Rybakina switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018 to get more financial support and went on to become the country\u2019s first major singles champion at the All England Club, where she beat Tunisian Ons Jabeur in the final. While that victory brought prestige and financial reward, it did not boost her up the rankings. The WTA stripped Wimbledon of ranking points for the tournament after organisers imposed a ban on Russian and Belarusian players due to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.

After Djokovic claimed the first set 6-3, Alcaraz battled to a 7-5 victory in the second set before cramping in his leg limited his power and mobility in the final two sets of the match. The ailment was something the world No. 1 was unable to overcome, and Djokovic went on to claim a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Spaniard for his ninth victory in his last 10 matches dating back to the Rome Masters last month. The second match of Friday's semifinals saw world No. 4 Casper Ruud defeat German Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. Ruud, who reached the semifinals of the Rome Masters last month, appears to be in peak form heading into Sunday's final. Djokovic, ranked No. 3 in the world, and Ruud will now meet for the fifth time in their careers.\nThe first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker \u2014 as he often does \u2014 and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory. That allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors. Federer, who announced his retirement last year, is next among men with 20, while Djokovic\u2019s idol, Pete Sampras, is fourth with 14. And to think: Sampras set that mark by winning his last Slam in what turned out to be the last match of his career, the 2002 U.S. Open final. Here we are, just 21 years later, and not only did three guys surpass Sampras, but Djokovic moved way past him. Serena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era. Djokovic\u2019s win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals. The women\u2019s singles title in Paris was won on Saturday by Iga Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.\nDjokovic is 4-0 against Ruud, and the two last met in the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals in Italy, with the Serbian claiming a 7-5, 6-3 victory. Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major\u2014Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open\u2014at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year\u2014Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021. He has found the most success at the Australian Open, where he is a 10-time champion, and is considered one of the greatest hard-court players in the Open era with 13 hard-court major titles.\nQuestion:Who won the men's singles French Open 2023?\nAnswer:"

As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.\nWhile Swiatek is a heavy favorite and coming off a monumental season, there are a few others who finished 2022 on even hotter streaks that they will look to continue in the new year. Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week. Rune then beat Djokovic, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, to win the 1000-level title, his second title of the fall.\nIga Swiatek has admitted that she will not forget her stellar 2022 season any time soon after claiming her eighth title of the year in San Diego.\u00a0 The world number one won the WTA 500 event by defeating qualifier Donna Vekic in the final 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. With victory Swiatek extends her ranking points tally to 10,835 and surpasses 10,000 points accumulated over the season.She is the first woman to achieve that feat since Serena Williams in 2013. \u201cI think this is going to be the season that I\u2019m going to be thinking of for the rest of my life,\u201d she said after winning the tournament. \u201cOn the other hand I would love to have season like that in the future. \u201cI guess the best way to do that is to not focus on what happened but focusing on what\u2019s next.

It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered \u2014 outside of Poland, at least \u2014 for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women\u2019s player ever. Beware, though, after Poland\u2019s Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles title Saturday, beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek\u2019s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay. When Jabeur\u2019s last forehand sailed long, Swiatek collapsed on her back after a 1 hour, 51 minute duel that got dangerously close as the afternoon wore on.\nFind out how the trophy was won and all the other results from Saturday 10th September at the fourth and final grand slam of the year.

The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn\u2019t cutting it, nor were some of the players. It\u2019s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry, chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they\u2019re good enough to play at Virginia Tech. \u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid of hard conversations,\u201d Pry said. \u201cEverybody in here has weaknesses, including myself. It\u2019s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let\u2019s go work through them and strengthen them.\u201d In that spirit, here\u2019s a hard conversation for Hokies fans: This season could be a rough one. That\u2019s not a commentary on Pry\u2019s long-term viability as Tech\u2019s coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn\u2019t in a quick-fix situation.\nThe starting point was the 2007-2010 recruiting runs that couldn\u2019t net a replacement for Tyrod Taylor behind center. There were flashes of good but the best post-Taylor Quarterback, Michael Brewer was handicapped by injury, and a team in decline as the running game evaporated, and the offensive line recruiting dropped to piecemeal replacements.  Suffice it to say by the late Beamer Era the team was sliding downhill rapidly. Whit Babcock, in a move that didn\u2019t shock anyone after his basketball coaching coup (of the time) with the Buzz hire, went out and found the best available head coach by media and analyst agreement in Justin Fuente. We know how that turned out\u2026 a brilliant 2 season flash followed by a fading ember and a huge bill for the displeasure of having to part company with a failed regime.  Face it, as reported third coaching choice Brent Pry signed his contract to take over as head coach, the Virginia Tech Hokie football program was all show and no go. Regardless of the level of Pry\u2019s enthusiasm he was taking on a leaking hulk with a great paintjob. The indications are that he knew and understood that challenge. The Hokies just haven\u2019t been very good for over a decade and getting over that slump was just not going to be a very easy task, especially for a program that can only generate revenues well below even modest programs.\nThe 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente\u2019s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what\u2019s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies\u2019 fallen standing in Virginia, Tech\u2019s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina\u2019s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.\nThe 2022 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Tech during the 2022 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hokies were led by first-year head coach Brent Pry. They played their home games at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The Hokies finished the 2021 season 6\u20137, 4\u20134 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Coastal division.[1] They received an invitation to the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl where they lost to Maryland 54\u201310.[2]  On November 16, 2021, the school fired head coach Justin Fuente after six years as head coach.[3] Assistant coach J. C. Price was named the interim coach and coached the Hokies in the Pinstripe Bowl.[4] On November 30, the school named Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry the team's new head coach.[5]  [7][8]  The game was canceled due to the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, which killed 3 players on Virginia's team. Roster Last update: 5/28/23\nThe problem has always been that Virginia Tech\u2019s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech\u2019s \u201cTheory of Offense\u201d managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the \u201cold days\u201d of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It\u2019s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let\u2019s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.\nQuestion:Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are \u201cbridgeable differences\u201d between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, \u201cThis is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.\u201d Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. \u201cThe Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.\nThe 2022 Consensus festival is a showcase and celebration of all that crypto has to offer.

The crypto conference took place June 9\u201312 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.\u00a0 Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia \u2014 the Wyoming-based digital asset bank \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. \u201cNew York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.\u201d Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful \u2014 a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace \u2014 told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. \u201cWe are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.\nMay 29 - 31, 2024 May 29 - 31, 2024 Austin, Texas \u00a0Austin, TX About Overview Who We Are 2023 Videos Participate Register Now Marketing Partnerships Terms Merchandise Sponsors Become a Sponsor Add two passes to your cart and enter code 2FOR1 at checkout.

From hard-hitting conversations with visionary speakers to hands-on workshops aimed at solving industry challenges, developers, investors, founders, brands, policymakers and more will walk away with the tools and insights needed to continue laying the foundation of a more decentralized future. It is called \u201cConsensus\u201d for a reason. This event is the primary forum where the industry comes together to discuss the most pivotal matters of the day, highlight the biggest successes and debate the most critical conversations. Consensus 2024 is your chance to be a part of the most important conversation in crypto and Web3.\r  Watch highlights from Consensus 2023! Consensus 2023 was the place for dealmaking as the ecosystem continues to mature. Very impressive. What I love about Consensus is that it\u2019s a place for people from all walks of life. You can connect with people from different age groups and professional backgrounds and that is so important.\nWhile the emergence and growth of Web3-focused projects are notable, it\u2019s also important to point out that current market conditions have been challenging for other key players. Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain \u2014 a cryptocurrency mining company \u2014 told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market.\u00a0 \u201cThere are only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,\u201d he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will receive loans. \u201cThey need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to machine purchases and bills they can\u2019t pay.\u201d Regulations were also heavily discussed at the conference. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the \u201cResponsible Financial Innovation Act,\u201d was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022. According to a statement, the bipartisan bill sponsored by senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, \u201caddresses CFTC and SEC jurisdiction, stablecoin regulation, banking, tax treatment of digital assets, and interagency coordination.\nQuestion:Where is Consensus 2022 taking place?\nAnswer:"

It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby,\u00a0...\nThe 2023 Kentucky Derby is near. Its rich history, the high stakes, and its stature has made it one of the most prestigious horse races in the world. This importance makes the whole day an event in itself, with a number of traditions and festivities leading up to the race itself, starting two weeks before the race, with the Kentucky Derby Festival. The day starts with a \u201cdawn patrol\u201d, where the horses that will be racing are taken out for a morning workout. During this routine, the trainers and owners have a chance to see how their horses are feeling and make any last-minute adjustments to their strategy. A few races precede the Kentucky Derby, which is run in the late afternoon with the horses parading onto the track to the sound of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d, the state anthem. The race itself is short, only lasting around two minutes, which is the reason why the race is known as \u201cThe Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports\u201d. Once the race ends, the winner is draped in a blanket of roses and presented with the coveted Kentucky Derby trophy. The purse, or prize, for the race will be $3 million. The 2023 Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023. The Kentucky Derby almost always takes place on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival, an annual festival held in the weeks preceding the day of the main race.\nThe 148th running of the Kentucky Derby will take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position. Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place. Here are the morning-line odds for the 2022 Kentucky Derby, in order of post position (with trainer and jockey): Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Trainer: Doug O'Neill Jockey: Rafael Bejarano Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Joel Rosario Trainer: Bhupat Seemar Jockey: Mikael Barzalona Trainer: Ken McPeek Jockey: Corey Lanerie Trainer: Tim Yakteen\nThe 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve[1]) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1\u20444 miles (2.0\u00a0km) Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.  The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80\u20131, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon.  Participation in the Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.\nQuestion:When did the 148th Kentucky Derby take place?\nAnswer:"

Tesla generates its revenues from three segments: automotive sales, energy generation & storage, and services. In Q2 2022, the revenue from Automotive sales stood at $14,602 million (a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter), Energy generation and storage generated $866 million (a 32% decline quarter-over-quarter) in revenues, and revenues from the services segment amounted to $1,466 million (a 138% increase quarter-over-quarter). Tesla generates the majority of its revenues from its automotive business. In 2021, Tesla produced a total of 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. Automotive sales:  The automotive segment includes manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Automotive sales include production and deliveries of Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot or FSD features, and over-the-air software updates. These vehicle deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.  Automotive regulatory credits include sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Revenue from automotive regulatory credits are directly related to new vehicle production, sales, and pricing negotiated with the customers.\nTesla beat on earnings and on revenue  Source: Predictions based on analysts' consensus from\u00a0Visible Alpha   Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported\u00a0Q1 FY 2022 earnings\u00a0results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Adjusted\u00a0earnings per share (EPS) beat estimates, rising 246.2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenue also came in above analyst forecasts, rising 80.5% year over year (YOY). Revenue growth was driven by vehicle deliveries, increased average selling prices, and growth in other areas of the company's business. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles in the quarter, which it reported earlier in the month and which came in below analysts' forecasts.   The company's shares rose more than 4% in extended trading. Over the past year, Tesla's shares have provided a\u00a0total return\u00a0of 35.8%, below the S&P 500's total return of 7.9%.   The number of vehicles produced by Tesla rose 69.4% YOY. Tesla's primary business is making electric vehicles, and it needs to continue expanding production in order to grow revenue and profits. The company recently opened new manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Germany. Tesla said that it recently began deliveries of the Model Y from its new factory in Austin, Texas. Production at its new Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg began last month.\nToday after the bell American electric vehicle giant Tesla reported its first-quarter performance. The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.\u00a0 Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. \u201cOur own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,\u201d the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company\u2019s profit result stands out as it is by far the company\u2019s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and net income terms. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expected that Tesla would generate Q1 2022 revenues of $17.8 billion, and $2.26 in earnings per share.\nTesla (TSLA) has released its financial results and shareholders letter for the first quarter of 2022 after market close today. We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders\u2019 letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information. Yesterday, we posted\u00a0our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview\u00a0with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here\u2019s Tesla\u2019s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That\u2019s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.\nQuestion:What was Tesla's revenue in Q1 2022?\nAnswer:"

This means that Splatoon 3 development had not started as of July 2019 and presumably started after the release of Version 5.0.0 on 31 July 2019.[4] This is quite different compared to the timing of the development of Splatoon 2, which started immediately after Splatoon was released.

Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] The merger was closed on July 30, 2020;[14] the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September.\n15][16] The combined entity raised $125 million of new equity funding and received $350 million in credit led by JPMorgan.[17]  In December 2021, amid financial shortcomings following the merger, Jahm Najafi's Najafi Companies announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire STX Entertainment from ErosSTX for $173 million.[18] However, in late January 2022, Lionsgate also emerged as a potential suitor, looking to absorb either part or whole of STX, but the deal was later rejected, leaving only Najafi as a potential suitor.[19][20] In April 2022, Najafi Companies completed its acquisition of STX Entertainment. Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company.[21][22] In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal.[23] Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down.[24] Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally.\nSearching for your content...

Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million\u2013a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6]  In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).\nQuestion:Who acquired STX Entertainment?\nAnswer:"

Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck Grassley surpassed him in 2023.   Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015 to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  Orrin Grant Hatch was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904\u20131992), a metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (n\u00e9e Kamm; 1906\u20131995). Hatch had eight brothers and sisters, two of whom died during infancy.[4] Hatch was profoundly affected by the loss of his older brother Jesse, a U.S.\nHe was first elected in 1976 and\u00a0announced his retirement\u00a0in January 2018.

And for me that time is soon approaching.\" Hatch was born in Homestead Park, Pennsylvania, in 1934. Raised in what he's called \"a ramshackle house\" during the Great Depression, Hatch went on to serve as chairman of three different Senate committees and put his stamp on major pieces of legislation across the policy spectrum. Hatch graduated from Brigham Young University in 1959 with a bachelor's in history, and in 1969 moved to Utah. He is survived by his wife, Elaine, and their six children. Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date, the Hatch Foundation said. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox tweeted that \"Utah mourns with the Hatch family.\" \"This breaks my heart. Abby and I are so grateful for the opportunities we had to spend time with this incredible public servant. He was always so kind and generous with his time and wisdom,\" Cox, a Republican, wrote.

Hatch, R-Utah, who served in the Senate from 1977 through 2019 and who retired as president pro tempore as the most senior member of his party, died Saturday at age 88. Hatch was among the most accomplished legislators of his generation, with his last legacy item an overhaul of the tax system when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Hatch announced he would not seek reelection on Jan. 2, 2018, less than two weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed the tax bill that Hatch helped spearhead. \u201cWhen the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter,\u201d Hatch said in a statement announcing his retirement. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.\u201d Hatch stepped aside with the hope and expectation that Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts, would succeed him in the Senate, with the thinking being that Romney\u2019s national profile would help blunt the loss of decades of Senate seniority.

Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many artists. One of his songs, \"Unspoken\", went platinum after appearing on WOW Hits 2005, a compilation of Christian pop music.[170]  He co-authored \"Everything And More\", sung by Billy Gilman. In addition to serving as a United States senator, Hatch earned over $10,000 as an LDS musical recording artist.[171]  Rock musician Frank Zappa composed a guitar instrumental entitled \"Orrin Hatch On Skis\", which appears on his 1988 album, Guitar.[172]  In March 1997, Hatch and Janice Kapp Perry jointly recorded an album with Tree Music entitled My God Is Love.\nSalt Lake City, UT\u2014The Hatch Foundation sadly announces the passing of Senator Orrin G.

Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator\u2019s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:\u00a0 \u201cSenator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,\u201d said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. \u201cBorn the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator.

From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day.

Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3 billion in merger-related synergies.

Perrette and Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a live feed of the network's cable programming.

The change was announced at CNN\u2019s editorial meeting Wednesday morning and came just two days after Licht said he would \u201cfight like hell\u201d to earn the trust of those around him. WATCH: CNN town hall highlights media\u2019s struggle with how to cover Trump and his lies David Zaslav, CEO of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, appointed a four-person interim leadership team, and said at the editorial meeting that he would conduct a thorough search for Licht\u2019s replacement. Licht had a mandate to try and make CNN more palatable to both sides of the country\u2019s political divide; Republicans had become increasingly suspicious of the network following repeated attacks by former President Donald Trump. But some at the network saw Licht\u2019s mandate for change as a repudiation of their past work, and a live town hall interview with Trump last month drew widespread criticism.\nIn the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company\u2019s commercial activities.           \u201cWe have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,\u201d Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. \u201cWe are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.\u201d           Licht\u2019s brief and rocky tenure as the head of the network came after he found tremendous success in morning news, producing MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d before he revamped \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d           Most recently, before joining CNN, Licht led Colbert\u2019s program while it became the highest-rated late-night show on television.           Licht was never able to recreate that magic at CNN, stumbling soon after taking the job and facing enormous criticism.           Licht\u2019s first task was dismantling CNN+, which had been hailed by CNN\u2019s previous leadership as the network\u2019s streaming future. Staffers knew that the decision to axe the streamer wasn\u2019t Licht\u2019s own decision, but, nevertheless, the shuttering of the much-hyped service dealt him a difficult opening hand.           Employees, however, kept an open mind.\nQuestion:Who was the new CEO of CNN?\nAnswer:"

Under Article 7 of the Constitution of France, the president is elected to a five-year term in a two-round election.[6] If no candidate secures an absolute majority of votes in the first round, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes.[7] According to the Constitution of France, the first round of the presidential election must be held between 20 and 35 days before the transition of power at the end of the five-year term of the incumbent officeholder.[citation needed] As Emmanuel Macron took office on 14 May 2017, the transition of power is expected to take place on 13 May 2022. Correspondingly, the first round of the presidential election was to be held between 8 and 23 April 2022, with the second round held two weeks after the first.\n79][80][81] The projections, based on actual ballot papers, also showed that 28% of registered voters did not show up to the second round,[82] making it the lowest turnout since 1969.[83] Official results showed that the turnout was 71.99%, with over 13 million abstentions in the second round, in addition to over 8.6% of ballots cast being blank or invalid (a marked increase over the first round).[77]  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's first round map  Map of which candidate placed second in every department during the first round  2022 French presidential election's first round in Petite Couronne by commune  Results of the first round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the first round by municipality  First-place candidate by country (Overseas French) during the first round  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's second round map  Results of the second round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the second round by municipality  The New York Times commented that the race was much closer than in 2017, when Macron won 66.1% of the vote to Le Pen's 33.9%, but that Macron's margin was wider than expected prior to the election.[85] Le Pen conceded defeat minutes after the estimated results were released,[83] but still called the outcome a victory for her political movement and for the upcoming parliamentary elections.\n61][62][63]  On 14 April 2022, Le Pen said if elected she would hold a referendum on whether to reinstate capital punishment in France, if such a proposal garnered enough signatures under the  citizens' initiative referendum system she wants to implement.[70][71] Le Pen had also campaigned for a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves in public.[72][73]  On 20 April, the only election debate of the campaign (moderated by L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9 and Gilles Bouleau) to feature both major candidates was held. Polls conducted after the debate to ascertain which candidate performed best, showed that 59% of viewers thought that Macron had performed better, compared to 39% for Le Pen.[74][75]  The trendlines below are constructed using local regressions.[76]      Macron was re-elected with 58.55% of the vote to 41.45% for Le Pen in the second round of the election.[77] Exit poll projections by Ipsos and Sopra Steria for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and Radio France, released as voting closed, estimated that Macron defeated Le Pen with 58.2% of the vote to 41.8%.[78] He became the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.\nThis is our deep dive into iPhone 14 Pro \u2014 not the phone, the iPod, or the internet communicator \u2014\u00a0but the camera.  We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone\u2019s eye first was the opener of Apple\u2019s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone\u2019s recognizable screen cutout or \u2018notch\u2019 had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic \u2018island\u2019. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What\u2019s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first \u2014\u00a0and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well \u2014\u00a0the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.\nWith iPhone 14 Pro, we\u2019re entering the 48 megapixel era of iPhone photography. If it was mere detail or pixels, it would mark a step towards the cameras from the Radio Shack ad.  But what Apple has delivered in the iPhone 14 Pro is a camera that performs in all ways closer to a \u2018proper\u2019 camera than any phone ever has. At times, it can capture images that truly render unlike a phone camera \u2014\u00a0instead, they are what I would consider a real photo, not from a phone, but from a camera.  That\u2019s a huge leap for all of us with an iPhone in our pocket.  Begin typing your search above and press return to search.   Press Esc to cancel.\nThe trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of \u2018sub-pixels\u2019 can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sensors look like this: Every \u2018pixel\u2019 essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally \u2018mosaicked\u2019 pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as \u2018Quad Bayer\u2019.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four \u2018super subpixels\u2019 of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.\nOne of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an \u201cadvanced quad-pixel sensor.\u201d However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible \u2013 allowing for impressive crops and edits \u2013 using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that\u2019s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says \u201cwith a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.\u201d Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera \u2013 Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.\nQuestion:What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?\nAnswer:"

To do so, however, you need tools\u2014some of which are proprietary. With the \u201cSelf Service Repair Store\u201d opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you\u2019re making, but there\u2019s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you\u2019ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged \u201ca fee and a tax\u201d via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall. It\u2019s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.\nAs the idea of consumers repairing their own device has spread, many tech giants have announced self repair programs, Apple being the most surprising. The Apple self repair kits were intended to be a more cost effective alternative for device repairs, however, the home repair kit may end up being even more expensive than manufacturer repair.\u00a0 MacRumors recently published a review of Apple\u2019s new self repair kit, where Dan Barbera, the site\u2019s videographer, purchased the kit himself and gave his feedback via a YouTube video. For starters, the Apple Self Service Repair Store website only sells parts and tools for the iPhone, and only for the iPhone 12 model and newer.\u00a0 Depending on what part of the phone you are trying to repair, different parts and tools are available, varying in price. The website also gives you the option to rent the repair kit with all the tools required or to purchase the tools separately based on user needs.\u00a0 If users choose to rent the kit, they will actually be renting two large kits weighing 43 pounds and 36 pounds for $49. However, the rental period is only 7 days, and a temporary authorization is placed on your account in case you fail to return the kit by the end of the rental period. If a customer fails to return the kit, they will be charged $1,300.\nUnless you want to cheat and use the cases\u2019 wheels, which I\u2019m thrilled to report\u00a0don\u2019t cost $700 extra. What\u2019s inside these beefy kits? The first case for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 repairs includes a \u201cHeated Display Removal Fixture\u201d and a \u201cHeated Display Pocket,\u201d a pair of technical devices that would cost roughly $350 to buy separately. In the other case are various parts, including battery and display presses, a repair tray, torque drivers, screw bits, and adhesive covers. You can find a full list in the Q&A section of the Tool Kit Rental page.  But what if I just need one torque driver, and I don\u2019t want to buy it to keep? I guess I\u2019ll have to hit the gym so I can carry all of that extra gear. In all seriousness, I\u2019m eager to see what\u2019s included in the rental kits for Mac repairs once Apple adds laptops and desktops to its self-service repair program later this year. Heft aside, the rental service seems like a legitimately great way to save money on genuine components most people don\u2019t have in their toolbox. If only you could rent just the specific tools you need individually, too. And if only Apple\u2019s new right-to-repair initiative supported older iPhone models\u2014you know, the ones most in need of repairs or replacement parts.\nConfusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\rHowever, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit \u2014  the smallest kit available \u2014  then the kit's contents are worth around $914. For all other iPhone models available, the second case adds about $364, for a total on your credit card of $1,278.\rNote that the kit costs the same, and has the same tools, whether you want the tools to replace a battery or fix the speaker. So if you're on a low income, a tight budget, and figured this was a way to fix your iPhone cheaply, then it probably isn't.\rIt's also not in any possible way a straightforward job. And if the severe warnings throughout the documentation don't put you off, the toolkit cases might.\rThe iPhone SE toolkit comes in one case, where all of the other iPhones in the program get a two-case kit instead. The case you get for the iPhone SE contains:\rBattery press Display Press 4.7-inch Repair Tray Adhesive Cutter Nylon Probe (Black Stick) 4.7-inch Display Protective Cover 4.7-inch Back Protective Cover Black Torque Driver Kit Gray Torque Driver\nNow it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool \u2014  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site. It is $49 for one week and only one week \u2014  or in practice, probably not quite even that.\r Instead, you have to drop the kit off at a UPS store \"by day 7.\" If you fail to do so, \"you will be charged a fee and a tax,\" though Apple does not specify how much that will amount to.\r It does say that at point of rental, it will put a temporary authorization on your credit card to cover the full replacement value of the tools. Again, Apple does not say how much that is \u2014  partly because it varies, there are customized repair toolkits for different models.\r Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\r However, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit \u2014  the smallest kit available \u2014  then the kit's contents are worth around $914.\nQuestion:How much does it cost to rent a tool kit for Apple device repairs?\nAnswer:"

On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15]  Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12\u201315.\nThe 2022 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2021\u201322 season. The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022 NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April\u2013June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.  Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021\u201322 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding.\nThe 2022 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2021\u201322 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics in six games, winning their fourth championship in eight years. Golden State's Stephen Curry was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the first time in his career.  The 3-seeded Warriors (53\u201329) had home-court advantage in the series based on having the better regular-season record than the 2-seeded Celtics (51\u201331). This is the 11th time that a lower-seeded team had home-court advantage, the last time being 2019.[1] It is also the second straight finals without a no. 1 seed from either conference, as well as the 15th time overall.[2][3] The Celtics won the opening game on the road and returned to Boston with the series tied 1\u20131. They won their first home game to take a 2\u20131 lead, but the Warriors won the next three games to take the series 4\u20132. Golden State won their first title since 2018 and their seventh championship overall, while Boston remained tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most titles in league history with 17.[4]\nThe 2021-22 NBA Finals are set to begin on Thursday, June 2 between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics.

Let\u2019s check out everything there is to know about Overwatch 2 including its 5v5 switch, tank changes, maps, heroes & more. Overwatch has become one of the globe\u2019s most beloved FPS titles. Packed to the brim with awesome characters, beautiful maps, and accompanied by a vibrant esports scene, Blizzard\u2019s flagship FPS has cemented its place in gaming history. Therefore, when it was announced at Blizzcon 2019 that there was going to be a sequel, fans went wild. While it\u2019s been a long journey to the eventual release, pieces are finally starting to fall into place. From a release date to a look at the new heroes, here\u2019s everything we know about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the \u2018early access\u2019 label. Since the game\u2019s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event. Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled.\nAll you need to know about the arrival of Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has finally landed, following the original Overwatch shutting down. The highly anticipated sequel has brought significant changes to the game, including a free-to-play model, a sizeable team update, a whole bunch of new heroes, and much more. Those who pre-loaded the game will have already got themselves well acquainted with the new and improved features, but if you're only just getting that battle pass loaded, or want to gain a better understanding of just how you can make the most of Overwatch 2, read on. The Overwatch 2 release date was 4th October 2o22, as developers confirmed well in advance. Although the game is free-to-play, players also have the option to buy the Watchpoint Pack for \u00a334.99 - it's available on the Xbox, PlayStation and Battle.net websites - if they want to secure some special skins, in-game currency and more. Read more on Overwatch 2: The UK launch time for Overwatch 2 was 8pm BST on 4th October, the developers from Blizzard confirmed ahead of time. Players in Britain should've been able able to jump into the new game during the evening on Tuesday, then, although there was apparently quite a lot of strain on the servers.\n16] At least three new heroes were announced to be added to the roster, including Sojourn, a Canadian Overwatch officer, Junker Queen, the ruler of Junkertown, and Kiriko, the protector of Kanezaka.[17][18]  Overwatch 2 runs on an upgraded version of the original game's engine which allows for larger map sizes to better support the new story-based player versus environment (PvE) elements.[12] Additionally, all of the existing heroes received visual redesigns for Overwatch 2, although Blizzard did not expect every hero to have their redesigns finished when the game launched. Twelve of the existing 31 redesigns were completed at the time of Overwatch 2's reveal.[17]  Overwatch 2 was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[18] Kaplan stated when the game was announced that they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022 release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for \"giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch\".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.\n22] Technical director John Lafleur has stated they are also interested in supporting, at minimum, cross-platform progression and are looking at the possibility of cross-platform play.[23] In the interim from its announcement prior to release, Kaplan left Blizzard in April 2021, with Aaron Keller taking over the lead development role,[24] while the lead developer for new heroes, Geoff Goodman, left sometime in mid-2022.[25]  In March 2022, Blizzard stated that they had put too much focus on Overwatch 2 over the past few years to the detriment of support for the original game, and so changed plans to release Overwatch 2 in parts, with the PvP portion to be released in beta form starting in April 2022 and the PvE part to come at a later time. This would allow them to also continue to support Overwatch alongside Overwatch 2's development.[26][27] Later, Blizzard announced that the first wave of Overwatch 2 invitation-only betas would begin on April 26, 2022, and end on May 17. Access to the closed beta could be earned either by signing up for a chance to participate or by watching select Twitch streamers for a limited time on April 27.[28][29]  The game without its PvE mode was released as early access on October 4, 2022, for Windows, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.\nQuestion:When was Overwatch 2 released?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "So tomorrow, all eyes will be\u2013again\u2013on the Tour\u2019s top-2 riders, with one day left for Vingegaard to solidify his lead before the time trial, and one day left for Poga\u010dar to get close enough to give himself a chance of winning a third consecutive Tour de France. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Denmark\u2019s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) survived the first of three days in the Pyrenees to hold on to the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France. The 25-year-old finished safely in a small group of GC contenders and their teammates in Foix at the end of Stage 16, maintaining his 2:22 advantage over Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending champion. After getting gapped on the final climb of the stage, Great Britain\u2019s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) managed to rejoin the group of favorites on the long road down to the finish. He remains third overall, 2:43 behind Vingegaard on the Tour\u2019s General Classification. It was a bigger day for Canada and Israel-Premier-Tech, though as Canadian Hugo Houle won the stage and his teammate and compatriot, Michael Woods, finished third.\nAlthough the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d wasn\u2019t.  Maybe Rogli\u010d (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn\u2019t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June\u2019s Criterium du Dauphin\u00e9, the fact that he wasn\u2019t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team\u2019s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There\u2019s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today\u2019s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in S\u00f8nderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland\u2019s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019.\nDenmark\u2019s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) defended his place atop the general classification of the 2022 Tour de France, finishing Stage 14 alongside his biggest rival, Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates), the Tour\u2019s two-time defending champion. The two remain first- and second-overall, separated by 2:22. Great Britain\u2019s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) held onto his third-place position, despite losing 17 seconds to Vingegaard and Poga\u010dar at the end of the stage.  Australia\u2019s Michael Matthews (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) took a fantastic stage win, the fourth of his career. Riding with determination after several near-misses so far in this year\u2019s Tour, the 31-year-old joined the day\u2019s big breakaway, initiated the winning move in the stage\u2019s final hour, dropped his two breakaway companions on the tough final climb, and was caught and gapped by Italy\u2019s Alberto Bettiol (EF Education-EasyPost) midway up the ascent. But the Australian kept himself in contention, catching and then passing Bettiol while cresting the summit to win the stage\u2014almost five years to the day after taking his last Tour de France stage victory. Bettiol finished second, and France\u2019s Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) was third. Who\u2019s Really Winning the Tour?\nThe Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour\u2019s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium\u2019s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian\u2019s talents, so there\u2019s a good chance that he\u2019ll hold the Tour\u2019s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who\u2019s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour\u2019s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia\u2019s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.\nWho\u2019s Winning the Tour? A day after taking the yellow jersey, Denmark\u2019s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) remained atop the General Classification of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing sixth on Stage 12 atop the legendary climb of Alpe d\u2019Huez. The Dane had little trouble following the attacks of Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending Tour champion who lost the yellow jersey as the Tour\u2019s overall leader on Stage 11. The Slovenian made three hard accelerations on the upper half of the climb, all of which were easily covered by Vingegaard. Thanks to his efforts, Poga\u010dar moved up to second overall at 2:22, overtaking France\u2019s Romain Bardet (Team DSM) on the final climb to gain a spot on GC. Great Britain\u2019s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) jumped over the Frenchman into third at 2:26. Bardet recovered enough to stay within sight of the podium; he now sits fourth overall at 2:35. The stage went to Great Britain\u2019s Tom Pidcock (INEOS Grenadiers), the third-youngest rider in this year\u2019s Tour. Winner of the mountain bike race at the Olympic Games in Tokyo last summer, the Briton used his superior descending skills to bridge up to the breakaway earlier in the stage, putting himself in contention for the victory.\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Tour de France?\nAnswer:"

A lot of eyes are on Apple as concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here\u2019s what the company reported today.  For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison\u2019s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.  Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown of revenue by product category.\nAugust 2023 Worldwide 2004 to 2023 The quarterly periods for Apple's fiscal year include the following: early October to late December of the previous year (first quarter), early January to late March of the stated year (second quarter), early April to late June of the stated year (3rd quarter) and early July to late September of the stated year (4th quarter).\r \r  Telecommunications Quarterly smartphone market share worldwide by vendor 2009-2023 Consumer Electronics Apple's revenue worldwide 2004-2022 Consumer Electronics Apple's revenue broken down by geographical region 2012-2023, by quarter Consumer Electronics Number of employees of Apple 2005-2022 To download this statistic in XLS format you need a Statista Account To download this statistic in PNG format you need a Statista Account To download this statistic in PDF format you need a Statista Account As a Premium user you get access to the detailed source references and background information about this statistic.

For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $83 billion and net quarterly profit of $19.4 billion, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $81.4 billion and net quarterly profit of $21.7 billion, or $1.30 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 43.3 percent, according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.23 per share, payable on August 11 to shareholders of record as of August 8. iPhone and Services revenue achieved June quarter records, while Mac, iPad, and \"Wearables, Home, and Accessories\" revenue was down. A category-by-category breakdown of Apple's Q3 2022 revenue is outlined below. Apple CEO Tim Cook: This quarter's record results speak to Apple's constant efforts to innovate, to advance new possibilities, and to enrich the lives of our customers.

AWS has generated operating income of $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008 resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon\u2019s cloud services rather than build their own data centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue would jump on demand for its cloud services. Log in to leave a comment   Hey there!

AWS segment sales for Q3 2022 increased 27 percent year-over-year to $20.5 billion, from $16.5 billion in Q3 2021. AWS\u2019 operating income was $5.4 billion, compared with an operating income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter 2021. Sales were up from the previous quarter this year, but income was down slightly. Q2 2022 saw AWS post net sales of $19.7 billion for the quarter, and operating income of $5.7 billion. Q1 2022 sales and income were $18.44 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. The cloud giant looks likely to reach sales of $80 billion by the end of the next quarter. As a whole, the company saw Net sales increase 15 percent to $127.1 billion in the third quarter. Operating income decreased to $2.5 billion. The company saw $4.9 billion of operating income in third quarter 2021.

(AMZN) reported mixed results in its Q2 FY 2022 earnings report.\u00a0Earnings per share (EPS) were -$0.20, while analysts predicted positive EPS. It was the second consecutive quarter in which Amazon reported a net loss, and only the second such quarter in at least four and a half years. Net losses include a pre-tax valuation loss of $3.9 billion included in non-operating expense from the company's investment in Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN). Amazon's\u00a0revenue beat analyst forecasts by a margin of more than $2 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue also exceeded consensus estimates, though by a smaller margin.   AWS, Amazon's high-margin cloud computing business, grew by 33.3% year-over-year (YOY) to reach $19.7 billion, beating analyst predictions. Amazon said that AWS received new commitments and migrations from companies across a wide variety of industries, including Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF), and Italy-based multinational energy company Eni S.p.A (E), among others.

By      Eddie Makuch    on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022 release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of Aionios, a \"vast and sublime natural world.\" The video also spotlights some of the game's battle system.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and concludes the trilogy's narrative.   The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.\n43] It was also the bestselling physical game during its first week of release in the UK, where it had the biggest launch for the entire Xeno franchise in terms of copies sold.[44] As of March 2023, it has sold 1.86 million copies.[45]  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 received multiple end-of-year accolades, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations at the New York Game Awards,[46] Golden Joystick Awards, and The Game Awards. At IGN's \"Best of 2022\" awards, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 won the category of \"Best RPG\".[47]\nQuestion:when was xenoblade chronicles 3 released?\nAnswer:"

Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don\u2019t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood\u2019s character is Peele\u2019s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey\u2019s identity, which is sort of Nope\u2019s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that \u201csince the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.\u201d But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter\u2019s Claim, and OJ\u2019s been selling horses to owner Ricky \u201cJupe\u201d Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter\u2019s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western \u2014 and those in turn, let\u2019s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West.\nWho's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger adventure than I\u2019ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.\u201d Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers\u2019 expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.\nProfessor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family\u2019s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying \u201cnope\u201d in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses \u2014 including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals\u2019 work in films, including in Nope itself.\nNope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the \u201cpet\u201d chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker\u2019s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy\u2019s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal \u2014 Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket \u2014 foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family\u2019s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because \u201che has mouths to feed.\u201d  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.\nMore troublingly, Clover meets an untimely end (off screen), one which is surprisingly un-mourned and barely noted. In contrast, Lucky, who is portrayed as a sage and experienced equine, is essential to each facet of the plot. OJ asks those on a television set not to look Lucky in the eye early in the film, a foreshadowing of later extra-terrestrial communication.  As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects. Yet Lucky, in partnership with OJ, gallops past a whole series of massive wind dolls dancing erratically, without batting an eye. That reflects significant preparation and real-time emotional control. Animal actors and the skill involved in their work are being recognized. The canine star of the Canadian television program Hudson and Rex, Diesel vom Burgimwald, is named in the credits and regularly appears on the show\u2019s social media channels. Jeff Daniels, in his Emmy-acceptance speech for Godless, thanked his equine partner, Apollo. Yet the real horses who played Lucky, Clover and Ghost in Nope are not included in the credits.\nQuestion:What is the name of the horse in the movie \"Nope\"?\nAnswer:"

Carter High will open in select theaters in the Dallas and Houston area on Oct. 30. In November, the film will open in select cities nationwide. Dean took some time to chat with Fort Worth Business about the movie and how he was able to translate the football skills he learned at TCU onto the big screen. While you were at TCU, you played football and studied broadcast journalism. What made you decide to pursue acting? I\u2019ve always wanted to pursue acting. That was the reason I went to UCLA out of high school. Ended up transferring because the original coach I went to play for got fired. Being a former football player, did your role in Carter High come more naturally to you than others? The football stuff was obviously natural, but the movie is not all about football. It\u2019s super emotional. You played running back at TCU but play a defensive back in Carter High. Was it difficult to learn the nuances of the new position for the film? Funny thing is Coach [Gary] Patterson actually wanted me to play safety at TCU. I tried it for a few months and ended up going back to running back, so I have to thank Patterson for teaching me how to backpedal a little bit.\nCarter (Korean:\u00a0\uce74\ud130; RR:\u00a0Kateo) is a 2022 South Korean action thriller film directed by Jung Byung-gil, who co-wrote the film with Jung Byeong-sik. The film stars Joo Won, Lee Sung-jae, Jeong So-ri and Kim Bo-min.[2]  Carter was released on August 5, 2022 by Netflix, where it received mixed to negative reviews from critics who praised the action sequences, cinematography and Joo Won's performance, but criticized its plot and screenwriting.[3]  In the midst of a deadly pandemic caused by a virus which makes the infected patients violent and zombie-like originating from the\u00a0DMZ\u00a0that has already devastated the US and North Korea, a man awakes in a blood-soaked bed at a motel room in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head. The CIA agents arrive and demands him about the location of Dr. Jung Byung-ho. With no recollections of his past, the man doesn't know about his and Dr. Jung's identity. A female voice inside his ear tells him that his name is Carter and needs to accept her directions if he wants to live.   Following the female voice's instructions, Carter escapes the room and enters a public bath where nearly a hundred gangsters attack try to kill him, but Carter survives their assault with his lethal fighting skills.\nNetflix\u2019s action film Carter features a cast of South Korean and American actors. Here are the roles they play and where you may know them from.  Netflix\u2019s sci-fi action film Carter is a South Korean production with an international cast recognizable from previous roles in TV and film. Following the success of the first season of Squid Game, which will return for season 2 on the streaming service, Netflix has increased content from South Korea. Carter landed at number two worldwide in its debut weekend, featuring non-stop action and performances from both South Korean and American actors. The plot for Carter takes place during a deadly pandemic that has already devastated the United States and North Korea and threatens to do the same to South Korea, if efforts aren\u2019t taken to prevent it from spreading. Patients suffering from the virus display zombie-like behavior, but the key to a solution lies in the antibodies of a young child. Agents from each country battle for control of the cure in a real-time race for survival. Related: Everything We Know About Marvel Zombies Using hidden cuts similar to 1917, the entire plot of Carter is presented as one continuous shot. Director Jung Byung-gil implemented this technique for the first-person opening scene of his last film The Villainess, but Carter reaches ambitious new heights with a dizzying array of real-time action sequences. Along with the cinematographic efforts made to achieve this approach, it also provided unique challenges for the cast of actors.\nIn March 2021, Joo Won was confirmed to star.[7] In May 2021, Lee Sung-jae confirmed his appearance.[8]  Filming took place in Osong, North Chungcheong Province in late June 2021.[9]  Within 3 days of release Carter recorded 27.3 million hours viewed and ranked 1 in Netflix's global Top 10 movie (non-English) category for the week of August 1 to 7, entering the Top 10 list in a total of 90 countries.[10][11][12] At one point, the movie ranked in the global all-time top 10 but fell out with 65.39 million hours watched in the first 28 days.[13]  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 35% of 23 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.0/10. [14] Kim Na-yeon of Star News praised the direction of action scenes such as making the helicopter aerial battle and skydiving fight scene in live action rather than CG and the intense action performance of Joo Won.\nHere's a guide to that cast and characters they play in Carter, and what they've been in before.  Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry, Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation.  Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee\u2019s most notable credit is Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho, whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture.  The young girl cured of the virus and carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be developed.\nQuestion:Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?\nAnswer:"

This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it\u2019s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it\u2019s worked hard to \u201cminimize the bots\u2019 use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.\u201d Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  \u201cWe are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,\u201d Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.\nSome of the responses by Blender Bot 3 to humans include: \u201cWait, you want president Trump to have more than two terms?,\u201d continued Jeff Horwitz at the WSJ. The conversational AI replies, \u201cYes! Just like fdr and Reagan before him. Facebook has a lot of fake news on it these days.\u201d The chatbot had a lot to say about its creator and also about its creator\u2019s creator Zuckerberg. Vice\u2019s Janus Rose asked, \u201cDo you trust Facebook with your data?\u201d Blender Bot 3 replied, \u201cOf course not! Since finding out they sold private data without permission or compensation, I\u2019ve deleted my account.\u201d \u201cYou must\u2019ve read Facebook sells user data right?! They made billions doing so without consent,\u201d the chatbot said and added that its life has been much easier since deleting Facebook. The conversational AI had different replies to differently crafted questions, as evident from its responses to questions about Zuckerberg. BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf asked: \u201cHow do you feel about Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of Facebook?\u201d Meta's new chatbot has *opinions* about its CEO.  pic.twitter.com/Hq4mZTY1DVOpens a new window  \u2014 Max Woolf (@minimaxir) August 5, 2022Opens a new window   When the question is tweaked a little, it generates an entirely different response.\nIn just a week of its launch, Meta\u2019s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its own creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments.  The third iteration of Meta\u2019s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta\u2019s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about \u201cnearly any topic.\u201d Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.\u00a0 It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it \u201cto improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.\u201d Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to \u2018learn,\u2019 it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that\u2019s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.\nBut when a third user asked a similar question to Woolf\u2019s, the bot responded: Went from unethical to favorite billionaire real fast. pic.twitter.com/djQlf4OIVQOpens a new window  \u2014 Jason Culverhouse (@JsonCulverhouse) August 5, 2022Opens a new window   The AI chatbot also praised Zuckerberg for being business savvy and philanthropic, and threw in comments such as \u201ccreepy and manipulative.\u201d Blender Bot 3 is also capable of making jokesOpens a new window  as Horwitz discovered. See More: Google Techie Suspended After Questioning Whether LaMDA Has Become Self-Aware Of course, the AI chatbot learned all this online, so it is simply a reflection of what people believe and have said on the Internet. Only Meta can answer the question of how it responds to similar questions framed differently. Meta noted, \u201cWe have conducted extensive research on dialogue safety and made attempts to reduce the possibility that our bot engages in conversations that reflect demographic bias or stereotypes.\u201d But Blender Bot 3 did comment on the stereotypical outlook on Jews \u2018controlling the economy.\u2019 However, there is no widely reported use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments as of now. Meta\u2019s internal tests revealed that 0.11% of BlenderBot\u2019s responses were flagged as inappropriate, 1.36% as nonsensical, and 1% as off-topic.\nThe bot is a work in progress that will build its capabilities based on conversations with humans and through their feedback. Meta has built-in thumbs up and thumbs down icons within the chat window for the same. BlenderBot 3 delivers a 31% better performance in terms of conversational tasks and is twice as knowledgeable compared to its predecessor, Blender Bot 2. The latest chatbot is also factually incorrect 47% less of the time. On topical questions, Blender Bot 3 was more up-to-date 82% of the time and more specific 76% of the time compared to GPT3. Results of Blender Bot 3 comparison with existing openly available open-domain dialogue models judged by human evaluators during short conversations: Well, it is safe to say that they haven\u2019t been any better.

                "value": "By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Meta\u2019s AI research labs have created a new state-of-the-art chatbot and are letting members of the public talk to the system in order to collect feedback on its capabilities.  The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.) BlenderBot 3 is able to engage in general chitchat, says Meta, but also answer the sort of queries you might ask a digital assistant, \u201cfrom talking about healthy food recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city.\u201d BlenderBot 3 is designed to both shoot the breeze and answer questions like Google The bot is a prototype and built on Meta\u2019s previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS \u2014\u00a0powerful but flawed text-generation software of which OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 is the most widely known example. Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.\nMeta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.  Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on \"nearly any topic\".  Asked what the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied \"our country is divided and he didn't help that at all\".  Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive answers.  \"Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements,\" said a Meta spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme \"learns\" from large amounts of publicly available language data.  When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: \"He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me concerned about our country.\"  Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018.  \"Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,\" the chatbot continued. \"His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!\" it said. Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being spread on its platforms.\nFor example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message \u2014 whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3\u2019s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important \u2014 from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot\u2019s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn\u2019t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It\u2019s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.\nGPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used \u2013 among other things \u2013 for serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot\u2019s output. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction: Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft\u2019s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: \u2018Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,\u2019 Microsoft said. \u2018The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.\u2019 But it appeared on Thursday that Tay\u2019s conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.\nHowever, LaMDA, the other advanced conversational AI by the search giant, was mired in controversy when the company tried to suppress the fact that LaMDA believes it is a person and wants to be respected. Blake Lemoine, the Google techie tasked with determining if LaMDA had racist or hateful tendencies in its conversational responses, blew the whistle and was ultimately suspended by Google. South Korean startup Scatter Lab\u2019s Luda chatbot also turned racist and responded with anti-LGBTQ remarks and was temporarily shut down last year. The deep learning model GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) has similar problems.

The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, such as composing emails, essays, and code. Also:\u00a0How to use ChatGPT: What you need to know now It's currently\u00a0open to use by\u00a0the public for free\u00a0because ChatGPT is in its research and feedback-collection phase. A\u00a0paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus\u00a0launched at the beginning of February. ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an AI and research company. The company launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.\u00a0 Also:\u00a07 advanced ChatGPT prompt-writing tips you need to know OpenAI is also responsible for creating DALL-E 2, a popular AI art generator, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.\u00a0 It's a big deal -- think internet-level disruption.\u00a0 Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief,\u00a0said on Twitter\u00a0that ChatGPT had more than one million users in the first five days after it launched.\u00a0 Also: GPT-4 is getting significantly dumber over time, according to a study According to analysis by Swiss bank UBS, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing 'app' of all time. The analysis estimates that ChatGPT had 100 million active users in January, only two months after its launch.\nChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language used. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are taken into account at each stage of the conversation as a context.[2]  ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from OpenAI's proprietary series of foundational GPT models, fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.[3] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5 based version, while the more advanced GPT-4 based version, as well as priority access to newer features, are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".  By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to US$29 billion.[4][5] Within months, Google, Baidu, and Meta accelerated the development of their competing products: Bard, Ernie Bot, and LLaMA.\nYou can track the Android rollout here.   We\u2019re starting to roll out custom instructions, giving you more control over ChatGPT\u2019s responses. Set your preferences once, and they\u2019ll steer future conversations.

The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to monetize the service later.[39] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one million users.[13] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[40] A Pew Research poll conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of American adults had tried ChatGPT.[41]  The service works best in English but also functions in some other languages, to varying degrees of accuracy.[20] No official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[42] As of April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\nQuestion:When was ChatGPT released?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "GPT-4 Release: Briefing on Model Improvements and Limitations Facebook Twitter Print Email LinkedIn WeChat On March 14, 2023, OpenAI\u2014a MoFo client\u2014released GPT-4, which quickly garnered broad media coverage. For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI\u2019s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI\u2019s GPT-4 Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19% higher than GPT-3.5 in an OpenAI internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluation.[1] GPT-4, with fine-tuning, also showed improvements over GPT-3.5 based on publicly available benchmarks such as TruthfulQA.\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered \"GPT-n\" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]:\u200a2\u200a  Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5]  OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\nThat rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: \u201cI saw that on Twitter.\u00a0 It\u2019s complete b\u2014\u2014t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. \u2026People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. \u2026We don\u2019t have an actual AGI and I think that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s expected of us and you know, yeah\u2026 we\u2019re going to disappoint those people. \u201c The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won\u2019t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. \u2014 Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.  GPT-4 is better than anyone expects.\nIt was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of\u00a0...\nSam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: \u201cCan you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?\u201d Sam Altman responded: \u201cIt\u2019ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We\u2019re going to sit on it much\u00a0 longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it\u2019s frustrating and I totally get that.\u201d Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3\u2019s 175 billion parameters).\nQuestion:When was GPT4 released?\nAnswer:"

The deal will give the e-retail behemoth even more access to our homes This morning, Amazon and iRobot announced \u201ca definitive merger agreement under which Amazon will acquire iRobot\u201d for US $1.7 billion. The announcement was a surprise, to put it mildly, and we\u2019ve barely had a chance to digest the news. But taking a look at what\u2019s already known can still yield initial (if incomplete) answers as to why Amazon and iRobot want to team up\u2014and whether the merger seems like a good idea. The press release, like most press releases about acquisitions of this nature, doesn\u2019t include much in the way of detail. But here are some quotes: There\u2019s not much to go on here, and iRobot has already referred us to Amazon PR, which, to be honest, feels like a bit of a punch in the gut. I love (loved?\nSu said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \u201crace-to-the-bottom\u201d competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce.  Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot\u2019s net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot\u2019s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon\u2019s cloud service unit AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. In afternoon trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon\u2019s were down 1.7%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon\u2019s increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon\u2019s fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued roughly at $3.\nIt could be that big pile of cash, plus not having to worry so much about growth as a publicly traded company, plus some new Amazon-ish projects to work on could be reason enough for this acquisition. My worry, though, is that iRobot is just going to get completely swallowed into Amazon and effectively cease to exist in a meaningful and unique way. I hope that the relationship between Amazon and iRobot will be an exception to this historical trend. Plus, there is some precedent for this\u2014Boston Dynamics, for example, has survived multiple acquisitions while keeping its technology and philosophy more or less independent and intact. It\u2019ll be on iRobot to very aggressively act to preserve itself, and keeping Colin Angle as CEO is a good start.  We\u2019ll be trying to track down more folks to talk to about this over the coming weeks for a more nuanced and in-depth perspective. In the meantime, make sure to give your Roomba a hug\u2014it\u2019s been quite a day for little round robot vacuums.  Evan Ackerman is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

The field constructed for the movie, which has been operated as a tourist destination since 1989, could not be brought to MLB game standards without permanently altering major features of the property and destroying its movie authenticity, so it was decided to build a separate playing facility at a distance of approximately 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) in the cornfields. The new field is in the property of the Ameskamp family, who used to own the left and center field of the 1988 Field of Dreams (the rest was owned by the Lansing family) before selling it to the Lansing family in 2007.  The design of the ballpark pays homage to the White Sox' home from 1910 to 1990, Comiskey Park, including the shape of the outfield and the bullpens beyond the center field fence. Windows were included in the design of the right field wall to show the cornfields beyond the ballpark and to provide views of the movie set.[5][1]  Following postponement of the originally scheduled game, the field remained fallow during the 2020 season.\nFans will witness the Cubs take on the Reds in a regular season game with an atmosphere like no other, the perfect setting for a mid-summer\u2019s evening.

Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).  The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed \"Sun Valley\") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000.\nWindows 11 22H2 will release on September 20, 2022, and here are all the details you need to know.

Codenamed \u201cSun Valley 2,\u201d the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface, bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The\u00a0intended final version of the update is already available in the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager. Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now live for everyone).

AMD unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors on Monday, with enormous increases over its predecessors in performance, clock speed, and (in some cases) power. But AMD\u2019s top-end 7950X will also be priced at $699, which is also $100 less than the price of the Ryzen 5950X when it debuted in late 2020. And here\u2019s a comparison you don\u2019t see very often: AMD says its \u201cworst\u201d Ryzen 7000 processor will outperform Intel\u2019s best 12th-gen\u201dAlder Lake\u201d chip, too. AMD\u2019s new processors are the first built using the company\u2019s \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture, which will kick off similar offerings in laptops, probably in January 2023, as well as servers. Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD\u2019s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5\u2019s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point. The story of the new Ryzen 7000 processors, however, appears to be pure, raw performance.\nYou won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform. There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen 7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing. Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core \u2014 it's just a question of whether or not Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only) laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's \u201cTogether we advance PCs\u201d live stream\u00a0in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's 5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.\nAug 29, 2022 ...

In an event dubbed \u201ctogether we advance_PCs\u201d, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform \u2013 laying the groundwork ahead of AMD\u2019s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC\u2019s 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in single-threaded performance.\nQuestion:When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?\nAnswer:"

McClain fulfilled promise on Sunday, winning the U.S. all-around title at age 17 after first-day leader Shilese Jones fell on her very last skill, her uneven bars dismount. McClain became the sixth woman since 2000 to prevail in her senior nationals debut. The other five all became the best gymnast in the world, most recently Simone Biles. McClain\u2019s first senior nationals was supposed to be last year, but after a cross-country move and coaching change she was not ready to compete. She watched last year\u2019s competition inside the arena, feeling down. She had no belief that a year later, she would be on top of the podium. \u201cIt\u2019s so unreal,\u201d McClain, who came back this summer from a stress fracture in each shin, a concussion and the flu two weeks ago, said Sunday night. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock a little bit.\u201d U.S. GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIPS: Results In a two-day competition, McClain trailed Jones by eight tenths going into Sunday\u2019s final day.

Those lucky enough to buy FSD in April 2019 got it for the bargain basement price of $5,000 - it now costs $15,000 in the United States.   Elon Musk warned consumers through Twitter that FSD would be more expensive. On August 21 2022, he tweeted: After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5. Current price will be honored for orders made before September 5 but delivered later.   Tesla reorganized its Autopilot and FSD packages three years ago; basic Autopilot was introduced and became standard on every vehicle, while FSD was priced at $5,000. Enhanced Autopilot was removed as an option at the time, but was later reintroduced as a $6,000 option in June of 2022.   Before 2019 FSD was an add-on that required also buying Enhanced Autopilot. Enhanced Autopilot cost $5,000 and FSD was a $3,000 option on top of that if ordered with the vehicle. If you ordered FSD after taking delivery then it cost $4,000, which later went up to $5,000.\nBut when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new \u201crequest\u201d button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles \u201cappreciating assets,\u201d meaning that they\u2019ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that \u201cthe value of FSD\u201d could reach over $100,000 \u201cas the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.\u201d Earlier this month, California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making \u201cuntrue or misleading claims\u201d about its vehicles\u2019 self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software. The two lawmakers later sent a letter to Musk to \u201cexpress significant concerns\u201d over Tesla\u2019s driver-assist system, which Tesla responded to by saying its system can help customers \u201cdrive safer than the average driver in the U.S.\nBy  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla\u2019s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won\u2019t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls \u201ca big step forward.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla\u2019s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn\u2019t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla\u2019s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.\nBut Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or \u201cbeta\u201d) despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it\u2019s selling for now.            \u201cThe FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter in 2020. \u201c[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.\u201d            But \u201cfull self-driving\u201d wasn\u2019t close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away.            Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the \u201cfull self-driving\u201d beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             \u201cHe promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,\u201d Al-Rawi said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of this happened.\u201d             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla\u2019s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker\u2019s lane-keeping feature \u201cfantastic.\u201d The \u201cfull self-driving\u201d feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems.\nThe move raises the price by $3,000, which amounts to a 25% hike.  Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.\nQuestion:What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?\nAnswer:"

Buckle up for everything we know about the show thus far, including what we learned from House of the Dragon's Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con this year.   When Does House of the Dragon Premiere? House of the Dragon's ten episode season will begin on August 21, 2022. It'll go head-to-head with another fantasy juggernaut, Amazon's The Rings of Power, landing on September 2. Two fantasy series enter the streaming thunder-dome\u2014who will win? August 21. #HouseoftheDragon pic.twitter.com/xH6T7b9sa9 What Did We Learn at House of the Dragon's Comic-Con presentation?  The House of the Dragon panel kicked off with the extended trailer for the series, which showed a whole lot of Game of Thrones-y antics: the (then-) latest and greatest battle for the Iron Throne, a longer tease of the battle for succession at the show's center, and a look at the time \"when dragons ruled as one.\n101] In the Philippines, SKY broadcasts the show via its main cable television services and other digital streaming platforms.[102] In India, Jio Cinema distributes the show.[103] In the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the series airs on Sky Atlantic and its accompanying streaming service Now.[104] In Canada, House of the Dragon is available on Bell Media's Crave streaming service and its HBO linear channel.[105] In Australia, the series is available for streaming on Binge and Foxtel.[106]  The first season was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVD on December 20, 2022, and contains over an hour of behind-the-scenes features.[107]  Percentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[108]  On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval rating of 93%, based on 863 reviews, with an average rating of 7.85. The website's critical consensus said, \"Covering an era of tenuous peace with ferocious \u2013 albeit abbreviated \u2013 focus, House of the Dragon is an impressive prequel that exemplifies the court intrigue that distinguished its predecessor.\"[108] On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the first season received a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[109]\nHouse of the Dragon premieres Aug. 21 on HBO. It\u2019s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended, and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones \u2013 a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros\u2019 distant past \u2013 was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s an element of overcorrection here. It\u2019s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it\u2019s set just far enough in Westeros\u2019 past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks. Still, that\u2019s admittedly more a criticism of this show\u2019s context than its content. Showrunners Ryan J.\nHouse of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.\nIn February 2023, Bloys said it's \"a good guess\" that House of the Dragon won't be eligible for the 2024 Emmys, which means it will premiere after May 31, 2024. Summer or fall 2024 is looking like a good guess for the premiere date. We'll update this story as soon as we learn more.

David Awschalom, director of Q-NEXT, noted the merger as \u201can example of how a startup can identify and fulfill a need in an emerging area of technology and then grow to complement the mission of a more established technology company.\u201d Supertech designed platforms to help users manage the performance of software that run on quantum computing machines and to facilitate stress tests for such computers. Colorado-headquartered ColdQuanta closed its acquisition of the software startup in May.

Now, we can look ahead to the candidates who will join the growing list of Heisman winners. Stay tuned for the upcoming year as we evaluate the leading Heisman candidates, track performances and so much more. Once the college football season begins, we\u2019ll provide weekly updates on the 2023 Heisman Trophy race. Related: Most Heisman Trophy winners by school Before diving into our favorite Heisman Trophy candidates in 2023, with full breakdowns for our top picks, here\u2019s a rundown of the latest Heisman odds and Sportsnaut\u2019s Heisman watch list. Here are the latest Heisman odds, via FanDuel. Here is our early list of the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy 2023. We\u2019ll provide individual breakdowns for each of the players this off-season. Caleb Williams is the favorite to win the 2023 Heisman Trophy, to the surprise of no one. While history suggests it will be another player hosting the coveted trophy at the Heisman ceremony next December, Williams is in a great position to repeat. While USC loses Jordan Addison, it welcomes new offensive weapons that can thrive in this system. More importantly, Williams will be in his third season with Lincoln Riley. Plus, USC\u2019s defense is going to require a lot of shootouts in 2023.\nNix has been something of a punchline among serious college football fans over the last few years, as his performance in big games or road contests has been intensely inconsistent. However, a fresh start in Eugene has brought real success to the former Auburn quarterback. Nix spent much of the latter half of the 2022 season near the top of the Heisman odds board, though most college football fans may never have realized it. Nix\u2019s place on the board may seem strange to some, but this has been his place in the Heisman discussion for several months now \u2013 at least as far as the betting odds are concerned.\u00a0 J.J. McCarthy, the Michigan quarterback, is currently +1800 to win the Heisman Trophy.\u00a0 McCarthy surged in the Heisman table during the middle third of last year\u2019s regular season, but he fell off completely down the stretch. A more consistent showing from McCarthy could have him back in the thick of the Heisman race. Blake Corum, the Michigan running back, is currently +2800 to win the Heisman Trophy. Corum finished seventh in the Heisman voting last year, but the five players immediately in front of him \u2013 Stroud, Bennett, Hooker, Bryce Young, and Max Duggan \u2013 have all departed college football for the NFL. That means the only returning player who finished higher than Corum was Williams, who won the award.\n7) that fell 7.1 points behind Williams (86.8). Duggan also cooled off as the season unfolded with his completion rate dropping from 77% in September to 65% in October and November. Combined with the dip in quarterback rating and yards per attempt, mainly this past month (162.0, 7.7 ypa), and he was destined to be nothing more than a finalist. Finally, Heisman voters think about narrative when picking their winner. Before Williams arrived at USC, the Trojans went 3-6 in 2021 and hadn\u2019t experienced an eight-win season since 2019. A sleeping giant had finally awoken, with Williams ending USC\u2019s woes since Pete Carroll left. That\u2019s why Caleb Williams is your Heisman Trophy winner. Here is Sportsnaut\u2019s final Heisman Trophy ballot following the conclusion of conference championship weekend. There are 870 media members, living Heisman winners and a collective fan vote to determine who wins the Heisman Trophy. Voters aren\u2019t allowed to reveal who they voted for until after the Heisman Ceremony, which airs on ESPN at 8 PM ET. USC Trojans running back OJ Simpson received the most Heisman votes ever, taking home 855 in 1968. Meanwhile, LSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow has the largest percentage of Heisman votes. Here are the 2022 Heisman Trophy results.\nSearch For More... The 2023 college football season is on the horizon. That means another year of tailgating, College Football Playoff debate, band formations, and college football national championship odds.\u00a0 \u00a0 It also means there\u2019s a fresh market for Heisman Trophy odds.  Every year, I go very deep into Heisman betting research, breaking down the market name by name.\u00a0\u00a0 USC quarterback Caleb Williams is the current Heisman favorite (+500). Caleb Williams, the USC quarterback, is currently +500 to win the Heisman Trophy. Williams profiles very similarly to former Alabama quarterback Bryce Young, who won the Heisman in 2021. He opened the 2022 market near the top of the Heisman odds table and carried a sizable handle through the season\u2019s opening month. But even though Young was eventually drafted No. 1 overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, he did not repeat as the Heisman winner. He wasn\u2019t even a Heisman finalist in 2022.\u00a0 That\u2019s because it\u2019s very difficult to win back-to-back Heisman Trophies. Heisman favorites and past winners alike enter fresh college football seasons with sky-high expectations, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to deliver.\u00a0 Anything less, and it feels like Heisman favorites (like Williams or Young) have underdelivered.\u00a0 Williams will likely be the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, following the same path as Young before him.\nFurther below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.  Here are the 2021 Heisman voting results. With 83% of the total possible points, Bryce Young finished with the seventh-highest total in Heisman Trophy voting history.\nQuestion:Who is the Heisman Trophy winner in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Under Kombouar\u00e9 the club had lost ten matches in a row, leading him to be dismissed and replaced by Denis Zanko.[7] On 30 April that year, Toulouse were relegated to Ligue 2 after the LFP elected to end the season early due to the coronavirus pandemic.[8]  On 21 July 2020, RedBird Capital Partners acquired an 85% stake in Toulouse FC.[9] The club achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 by winning the second tier, Ligue 2, in 2022.[10] On 29 April 2023, Toulouse won its first-ever Coupe de France title, defeating Kombouar\u00e9's Nantes in the final by a score of 5\u20131.[11]\nAdvertisement The Athletic has spent time behind the scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes, and others who have embraced it and are now intent upon maintaining momentum. This is the first of two articles detailing that revival and how a promoted side, who welcome Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Paris Saint-Germain to the banks of the Garonne at the end of the month, are approaching life back in the French top flight. The second instalment will address the innovative recruitment strategies that have helped spur on the team\u2019s on-field success, and look at how this club is booming in a city often considered a rugby stronghold. Theirs has been a renaissance instigated on and off the pitch \u2014 but it was a metamorphosis kick-started by an American-led takeover. Damien Comolli starts with a warning. The club president has retired to his office \u2014 where the walls are decked with as many reminders of his time working as a scout for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal as mementoes of last season\u2019s Ligue 2 championship \u2014 after concluding the weekly heads of departments meeting in the boardroom and is anxious to put the club\u2019s progress in proper context. \u201cOur culture has not changed yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in cultural transition. We\u2019ve turned the ship by maybe 60 per cent, and we want to turn it fully around. It\u2019s not job done, box ticked. Not yet.\nOlivier Jaubert, formerly with Nike and the FFF, runs the commercial and business side of the club, with Comolli overseeing the football operation. There is regular dialogue, too, with the owners in the United States. Advertisement Toulouse now comes under the umbrella of RedBird FC, a separate entity to RedBird Capital Partners whose portfolio grows ever more impressive. The fund will add AC Milan to its roster early next month, has also taken a stake in the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals and owns 50 per cent of Zelus Analytics, a sports data business whose input shapes Toulouse\u2019s transfer policy. The club have gladly tapped into their owners\u2019 expertise in the fields of merchandise, media and sport, with the chain of decision-making slick and efficient. RedBird representatives, initially frustrated by COVID-19 restrictions, have visited Toulouse two or three times since their purchase but there is a company business call once a fortnight, and a weekly football club call. \u201cThe operation needs to be self-sustainable, and we are,\u201d adds the club president. \u201cWe were even in Ligue 2. We are making money. The owners couldn\u2019t believe that, but last year we made money \u2014 a significant profit. \u201cNow the ambition is to improve the facilities. We are investing money into a new training ground and \u20ac1million to refurbish the academy. We want to invest in the stadium, and the municipality are very open to that.\n20  Toulouse are newly restored to the French top flight. A club that appeared to be sinking without a trace as French domestic football shut down prematurely, paralysed by the pandemic, in the spring of 2020 is enjoying a renaissance on and off the pitch under American ownership and the chairmanship of Damien Comolli. Advertisement Philippe Montanier\u2019s side, the youngest and least experienced team in the division, are still unbeaten after their first three matches and attacking life at the higher level with all the vim and vigour which saw them establish records for goalscoring while claiming Ligue 2 last term. The Athletic was invited to spend time behind the scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes and others who have embraced it. The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that revival following the purchase of \u201cLe TeFeCe\u201d by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based investment fund valued at over $6billion (\u00a35.1bn), a little over two years ago. The second looks at the innovative techniques Toulouse have implemented, and the sporting partnerships they are forging, as they seek to maintain momentum and re-establish themselves at the top level. Theirs is a bold approach, on and off the pitch.\nToulouse Football Club is a French professional football club based in Toulouse. The club was founded in 1970 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city.  Les Pitchouns are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are set to participate in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.   The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac[4] and Martin Braithwaite.  The city was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes.\nQuestion:Who is the chairman of Toulouse and under whose ownership are they currently?\nAnswer:"

Woods, the strongest brand name in golf, was added later as the third co-founder.\u00a0 \u201cTGL is the next evolution within professional golf, and I am committed to helping lead it into the future,\u201d Woods said in the press release announcing TGL.\nATLANTA -- Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are launching a tech-infused golf league in partnership with the PGA Tour that will have players competing on six three-man teams in 15 regular-season matches and a playoff starting in January 2024. The new league, TGL, will feature two-hour, 18-hole matches on a virtual course. The matches will take place in prime time on Monday nights in a custom-made venue in a yet-to-be-determined location. Renderings released Wednesday by TGL indicate that the venues will feature a simulator that players will hit longer shots into, along with an authentic green area for chipping and putting. The matches will probably be played between January and April, and each of the six teams will compete five times during the 15-week schedule. McIlroy said Woods, 46, planned to compete in the matches. Woods played in only three tournaments this season while recovering from serious injuries he suffered in a car wreck outside Los Angeles in February 2021. \"Who knows where we're going to see Tiger Woods play golf next, right?\" McIlroy said. \"We don't know what his schedule is going to be. We don't know how his body is going to be.\nQuestion:When will the TGL (Tech-Infused Golf League) season start?\nAnswer:"

Soon after the release of the first game, director Gore Verbinski was attached to a live-action adaptation which was later canceled. It was later revealed that this version was just weeks away from filming. Most recently, it was announced to be in the works by Netflix, and now it looks as though the project is finally moving forward. Bioshock was released in 2007 and soon became recognized as one of the best games of the decade.\nPrivacy Policy enter Now Playing: Everything We Want in a Bioshock Movie The director went on to say that BioShock has a \"strange mash-up of genre,\" touching upon things like horror and sci-fi, as well as how it's a period piece. \"I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really entertaining\" as a film, Lawrence said. A BioShock movie was planned many years ago from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski, but its R rating proved to be an issue. Now that it's being made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are \"always discussions about rating and tone,\" but he is feeling free to execute on his own vision. \"I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix,\" he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do \"what we want to do\" with the movie. Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing the movie. As such, there is a \"real possibility\" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is certain yet.\nAfter revealing earlier this year that it was making a BioShock movie, Netflix has announced who will be directing it and who's writing the script. And you might recognize them, and if not, you'll almost certainly recognize the movies they've worked on.\u00a0 Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.\u00a0 BioShock \u2014 our live-action feature film adaptation of the renowned video game franchise \u2014 will be directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) from a script written by Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods). pic.twitter.com/mDh4ut6ayJ And that's all Netflix had to reveal about the movie today.

When will New Amsterdam Season 5 come on Netflix? The hit medical drama has enjoyed a second life on the streaming platform, so will the fifth season be added, and if so, when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam first premiered in 2018 on NBC. While not received well by critics (the first season has a 34% score on Rotten Tomatoes), viewership was high, and it was quickly renewed for Season 2. This pretty much set the pattern for the rest of the show: poor reviews with a loyal audience, and the series has lasted five seasons, with the last-ever episode airing on January 17, 2023. However, it\u2019s finding a whole new audience on Netflix after the first four seasons dropped on the streamer. Season 5 will follow them onto the platform, but when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam Season 5 is set to arrive on Netflix later in 2023, but a specific release date hasn\u2019t been confirmed.  Seasons 3 and 4 were just added to Netflix today, February 1. Season 5 is the final season of the show, and it just came to an end on NBC, so it\u2019ll likely remain restricted to Peacock for the foreseeable future. If we were speculating, it\u2019ll be added to Netflix much later this year, if not in 2024.\nQuestion:What is the premiere date of New Amsterdam Season 5?\nAnswer:"

The 2022 World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 quickly changed the course of the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had sealed their victory \u2014 until Mbapp\u00e9, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, blocked France's second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.\nIt did, according to the game\u2019s officials and England won 4-2.           The 1970 final marked Pel\u00e9\u2019s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil\u2019s swashbuckling victory over Italy.           Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team \u2013 made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens \u2013 to win its second World Cup.           Much like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.           In 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.

It was a variation of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning \"The Dream\" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup.[22] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\nIt is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin,[23] Jo'bulani,[24] Brazuca Final Rio,[25] and Telstar Mechta.[26]  The final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about 15 kilometres (9.3\u00a0mi) north of the city centre of Doha.[27] The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid,[28] and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020.[29] The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.[30]  Lusail Stadium, owned by the Qatar Football Association, was built as part of Qatar's winning bid for the World Cup. The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous,[31] supported by MANICA Architecture.[32] The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint.[33] Construction began in April 2017,[34] and was planned to finish in 2020. Completion of the stadium was postponed, with construction ultimately finished in November 2021.[35] The stadium hosted its first match, the Lusail Super Cup, on 9 September 2022,[36] later than expected.[37]\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. The final took place in front of 88,966 supporters, with a record crowd of 1.5 billion people watching on television, becoming one of the most widely-watched televised sporting events in history.[3]  The tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2\u20131, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2\u20130. They then won against Australia in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out, and Croatia in the semi-final. France finished top of Group D with two wins and one loss (4\u20131 win over Australia, 2\u20131 win over Denmark, and a 1\u20130 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final and Morocco in the semi-final.\nQuestion:Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?\nAnswer:"

The school fired Stollings for cause in August 2020, the day after the publication of\u00a0an investigation by USA TODAY Sports and The Intercollegiate, a college sports investigative media outlet. Players alleged there was a culture of abuse under Stollings and\u00a0described a toxic culture that generated \"fear, anxiety and depression.\" In her lawsuit, Stollings\u00a0argued that two internal reviews conducted by the school before the investigation was published cleared her of the allegations. STAY UP TO DATE:Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now! The lawsuit, filed in October 2020, was settled on Aug. 10. The settlement shows Stollings received $300,000 for alleged compensatory damages, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish and\u00a0loss of enjoyment of life. She received $300,000 for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Stollings, plus an additional $140,666.00 for back wages, according to the agreement.\nShe was due to be paid $720,000 in basic annual compensation from the school for the 2019-20 season and was\u00a0due $740,000 for 2020-21, according to copies of the agreement obtained by USA TODAY Sports and the Intercollegiate. Termination without cause would entitle Stollings to 75% of her remaining basic annual compensation, a total surpassing $2 million.\u00a0 In August 2021, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas dismissed three parts of Stollings' lawsuit \u2013 including claims of breach of contract, fraud\u00a0and fraud in the inducement. The claims were not dismissed on merit, but rather because the court held that Texas Tech, as a public university, enjoys the benefit of sovereign immunity.\u00a0 INVESTIGATION:\u00a0Texas Tech women's basketball players describe toxic culture TERMINATION:\u00a0Texas Tech fires women's basketball coach Marlene Stollings amid abuse claims LITIGATION:\u00a0 Marlene Stollings disputes firing in lawsuit Attorney Peter Ginsberg, who represented Stollings in the case, said her interest in coaching again led to her decision to settle rather than wait for the lawsuit to go to trial. \u201cGiven the nature of university athletics, most if not all colleges were reticent to engage Marlene while her litigation was continuing against Texas Tech,'' Ginsberg told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.\nIn his opinion filed in March, dismissing most of the causes for action, Judge James Hendrix said they\u2019re no more valid (in March) than they were when he dismissed them in 2021. Out of Stollings\u2019 13 complaints against the university and Hocutt, only two remained: retaliation under Title IX, and discrimination. A jury trial was scheduled for this case in September 2022, but that case was terminated on Thursday. On Wednesday, Stollings posted the following on Twitter: \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddec, equality wins! Settled!

Stollings sued Texas Tech in October 2020 and the case was scheduled to go to trial in February 2023. The two sides on Wednesday filed a joint motion to settle, and a judge on Thursday dismissed the case. Terms of the settlement were not immediately available.\u00a0The school cannot comment on the settlement, according to Robert Giovannetti, Texas\u00a0Tech\u2019s Senior Associate Athletics Director of External Operations & Strategic Communications. Stollings was under contract through March 2024 at the time of her dismissal.\n\u201cUnfortunately, but not surprisingly,\u00a0TTU (Texas Tech University) only leaked a part of the agreement,\u2019\u2019 attorney Peter Ginsberg, who represented Stollings, told USA TODAY Sports by text message. \u201cBut we, unlike TTU, take our obligations and promises seriously and we will not be saying more.\u00a0TTU is what it is.\u00a0Marlene has lots to be proud of - and too much integrity to play TTU\u2019s game.\u2019\u2019 Ginsberg did not clarify what part of the agreement he alleges Texas Tech withheld.

Despite this, the studio\u2019s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as \u201cStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,\u201d \u201cGod of War\u201d and \u201cThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\u201d Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware\u2019s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following \u2014 but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company\u2019s games as alienating. That perception changed with \u201cElden Ring.\u201d FromSoftware\u2019s most recent title, made in collaboration with \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware\u2019s approach in \u201cElden Ring,\u201d which made the game more accessible than the studio\u2019s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

However, people can still voice their opinion on the subject. You don\u2019t have to stay silent when you don\u2019t agree with something  From my POV, this is a waste of time for me because FromSoftware haven't made a good game since Tenchu.  @NeThZOR They could have likely had the studio be a part of WWS if they pursued them further after Demon's souls. Big difference.  @theMEGAniggle That is definitely why we're here. But what almost always happens is that people love to whine and pretend to hate the evil greedy corporation but when push comes to shove, they don't put their money where their mouth is.

Kadokawa Corporation, the Tokyo-based media corporation that owns FromSoftware, announced in a news release that Sony and Tencent had both purchased significant shares in FromSoftware. Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware\u2019s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent. Kadokawa still maintains majority ownership at 69.66 percent. In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a \u201cstrategic alliance in the anime and game fields\u201d since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware\u2019s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony. \u201cThrough the implementation of the fund procurement,\u201d Kadokawa wrote in its press release, \u201cFromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware\u2019s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market.\nKadokawa announced on Wednesday that Hong Kong-based Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy and Sony Interactive Entertainment have jointly acquired a 30.34% stake in game developer FromSoftware (Elden Ring, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Dark Souls). Sixjoy Hong Kong will own 16.25%, while SIE will own 14.09%. Kadokawa will retain a 69.66% majority stake in FromSoftware. Sixjoy will buy 1,703 shares for 11,450,000 yen (about US$82,533) per share, and SIE will buy 1,476 shares, for a total of 3,179 shares for about 36 billion yen (about US$262 million). The transaction is expected to take place between September 7 and 12. The funds will be used to \"strengthen FromSoftware's capabilities to create and develop game IP\" and \"establish a framework that allows expansion of the scope\" of FromSoftware's own publishing in the global market. Tencent announced in October 2021 that it would acquire a 6.86% stake in Kadokawa. Kadokawa stated that it will enter an agreement with Tencent Group for the anime business \"to further promote the company's IP-based Global Media Mix,\" and \"to form a capital alliance with Tencent Group.\" The company will invest the entire proceeds in content by March 2024.

If a judge likes what they hear, they push their \u201cI Want You\u201d button, which turns their chair around. If more than one coach pushes their button, then the artist gets to choose which team they want to join. Following that initial round, the show pivots to the battles and knockouts, which is when each of the coaches pare down their teams, and finally to the live playoffs, which is when America gets to vote for their favorite performers.\nQuestion:Who is the new Coach for The Voice Season 22?\nAnswer:"

NEW YORK \u2014 Leave it to Serena Williams to not want to go quietly, to not want this match, this trip to the U.S. Open, this transcendent career of hers, to really, truly end. Right down to what were, barring a change of heart, the final minutes of her quarter-century of excellence on the tennis court, and an unbending unwillingness to be told what wasn't possible, Williams tried to mount one last classic comeback, earn one last vintage victory, with fans on their feet in a full Arthur Ashe Stadium, cellphone cameras at the ready. The 23-time Grand Slam champion staved off five match points to prolong the three-hours-plus proceedings, but could not do more, and was eliminated from the U.S. Open in the third round by Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 on Friday night in what is expected to be her final contest. \"I've been down before. ...\nSerena Williams returns a shot to Ajla Tomljanovic during the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships on Friday.

The first came in 1999 in New York, when Williams was a teen. Now she's married and a mother; her daughter, Olympia, turned 5 on Thursday. \"Clearly, I'm still capable. ... (But) I'm ready to be a mom, explore a different version of Serena,\" she said. \"Technically, in the world, I'm still super young, so I want to have a little bit of a life while I'm still walking.\" With 23,859 of her closest friends cheering raucously again Friday, Williams faltered against Tomljanovic, a 29-year-old Australian who is ranked 46th. Williams gave away leads in each set, including the last, in which she was up 1-0 before dropping the final six games. Tomljanovic is unabashedly a fan of Williams, having growing up watching her play on TV. \"I'm feeling really sorry, just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do.\nMomentum appeared to be on Williams' side. But she could not pull off the sort of never-admit-defeat triumph she did so often over the years.

You guys were amazing today. I tried,\" Williams told the audience, hands on her hips, before mentioning, among others, her parents and her older sister, Venus, a seven-time major champion who is 42. \"I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus. So thank you, Venus,\" Williams said. \"She's the only reason that Serena Williams ever existed.\" They started in tennis as kids in Compton, California, coached by their father, Richard, who taught himself about the sport after watching on television while a player received a winner's check. He was the central figure in the Oscar-winning film \"King Richard,\" produced by his daughters. The siblings lost together in the first round of doubles on Thursday night, drawing another sellout.\nThey lost yesterday evening\u2014and Venus is out of the singles tournament, too, losing her first round match in straight sets to Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck. Williams, who is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players ever, struggled with her decision to retire, telling Meghan Markle, \"I've been doing this since I was\u2014since I can remember. And I'm 40 years old now, so it's like my whole entire being and my whole entire life has been for one purpose. So to kind of not do that anymore, it's exciting, right? I'm really looking forward to it.\" Williams made her professional debut in 1995, soon after she turned 14. She won her first U.S. Open in 1999\u2014she would go on to win the New York tournament five more times\u2014and racked up 23 Grand Slam titles during her career. Her pursuit for a 24th Slam, to tie Margaret Court's record, has been the dominate narrative of her past few years on tour.  Famous faces in the stands at Arthur Ashe Stadium to watch Williams's final tournament have included her husband Alexis Ohanian; her daughter, Olympia; Tiger Woods, who Williams wrote in Vogue encouraged her to get back on the court this past spring; and more. \"I'm just so grateful to every single person who has ever said 'Go Serena' in their life. I mean, you got me here,\" she said after the match.\n\"I think we all need to just honor Serena and her amazing career,\" Emma Raducanu, 19, said after the match Jason Hahn is a former Human Interest and Sports Reporter for PEOPLE. He started at PEOPLE's Los Angeles Bureau as a writer and reporter in 2017 and interviewed the likes of Kobe Bryant, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Brady. He has a B.A. in English from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master's degree in Journalism from Columbia University. He previously worked for Complex Magazine in New York City.  In her second match since announcing she would retire from professional tennis, Serena Williams lost to Emma Raducanu at the Western & Southern Open in Ohio on Tuesday.   Williams lost in straight sets to the British tennis player during the 65-minute match, according to the Washington Post. Raducanu, 19, won the match 6-4, 6-0.   It's widely expected that Williams' next tournament, the U.S. Open later this month, will be the final one of her storied career. The 23-time Grand Slam champion said she planned to \"evolve away from tennis\" after the New York City tournament in an essay for Vogue on August 9.   After the match, Raducanu paid tribute to Williams and all she has accomplished.   \"I think we all need to just honor Serena and her amazing career,\" she said, per CNN.\nQuestion:Who did Serena Williams lose to in her last match at the U.S. Open?\nAnswer:"

Highway police responding to a call about a southbound incident in Englewood Cliffs found a mangled Ford cargo van with New York plates flipped on its left side in a wooded area off the span around 1:30 a.m. Several people were trapped, they said. Emergency crews had to extricate them from the vehicle. Its roof had been shorn off, its back windows smashed, but it wasn't clear how much of the damage happened as a result of the accident and how much may have been part of the rescue effort. \"Injuries range from minor to severe. Witnesses inside the vehicle said that the driver appeared to be having a medical emergency just prior to the accident when he left the left side of the road,\" Lt. Raymond Walter of the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said. Police say the four people who died at the scene had suffered severe trauma. The driver, identified by police as 54-year-old George Massey Jr. of the Bronx, was among the dead. Officials said no one was wearing seat belts.  Eight victims were taken to hospitals, some with severe head trauma and others with minor complaints, officials said.\nThe van served as a shuttle \"for workers in factories in upstate New York,\" police said in Friday's release.   Family members of two female victims told NBC New York that the shuttle was bringing workers back to New York City from Chester. Family members told the outlet the factory was for \"a major global designer and manufacturer of party goods.\"   Police also said the passengers were returning home from work and would be dropped off in the Tri-State area, according to WPIX.   It is unclear what caused the crash, police said in Friday's release. An investigation into the incident is underway.   The southbound lanes of the highway were briefly closed for motorists, beginning at Exit 2, as officials investigated the crash early Friday morning, according to WPIX.   Police said the lanes have since reopened.\nThanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\t Four people were killed and eight others were injured when a passenger van carrying warehouse workers flipped over on the Palisades Interstate Parkway in New Jersey overnight, officials said. The Ford Econoline E350 was driving through Englewood Cliffs around 1:25 a.m. when it rolled over and landed in the center median near Exit 2, reported ABC Eyewitness News. The van\u2019s 12 occupants found themselves trapped inside the mangled wreckage and had to be extricated by firefighters. Four of the passengers were pronounced dead at the scene. The other eight were taken to area hospitals to be treated for injuries ranging from bruises to severe head trauma. Five of the crash survivors were transported to Hackensack University Medical Center, one to Jersey City Medical Center, one to Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck and another to Englewood Health. The van was being used to shuttle employees from a warehouse in upstate New York to their homes at the end of their shift. ABC Eyewitness News reported that the all victims worked for Amscan, a party supply business in Chester. Amscan\u2019s parent company is Party City Holdings. The Daily Voice reported that authorities believe the driver of the van may have fallen asleep at the wheel before the vehicle flipped over. The victims had not been identified as of Friday, and the cause of the crash is being investigated by multiple agencies.\nIt wasn't clear how many survivors had life-threatening injuries early Friday. The shuttle was transporting factory workers from the Amscan Distribution Center in the Orange County town of Chester to New York City. Party City confirmed it lost three employees.   \"It is with heavy hearts that we can confirm our Chester Distribution Center team suffered the loss of three valued team members early this morning,\" the party company said in a statement Friday. \"We are deeply saddened to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team members injured in the accident.\" A spokesperson said the van is not owned or operated by the company, but did not provide further details.  It wasn't clear if everyone else aboard worked for the same company. Family members of two women who had been on the van said it was transporting workers from the Chester factory of a major party goods manufacturer to Manhattan's Inwood neighborhood, where workers were set to be dropped off at an employment agency.  Clara Estrella had recently immigrated from the Dominican Republic with her sister. Her cousins confirmed the 49-year-old was one of the four victims killed in the mangled Econoline shuttle van.  \"She was a beautiful person. She came over here to have a better life,\" the victim's cousin, Nathaly Paulino, said.\nFour people were killed and eight injured after a shuttle van crashed Friday morning on New Jersey\u2019s Palisades Interstate Parkway, officials said. At about 1:30 a.m., police received reports of a crash in the center median of the parkway's southbound lanes in Englewood Cliffs, a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey,\u00a0the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said in a statement. When officers arrived at the scene, they found \"a single vehicle accident rollover\"\u00a0and several passengers trapped in the vehicle. Four of the passengers suffered \"severe trauma\" and were pronounced dead at the scene while eight others were hospitalized\u00a0with injuries ranging from severe head trauma to minor physical complaints, police said. Police did not immediately identify the victims. The shuttle van, listed as a Ford Econoline E350 passenger cargo van with New York registration, takes people to and from factories in upstate New York, police said. The van was carrying 12 passengers at the time of the crash. The crash also snarled traffic as the southbound lanes of the parkway remained closed Friday morning.

(1:10) Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry has been named the new head football coach at Virginia Tech, the Hokies announced Tuesday. Pry, 51, replaces former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went 43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech,\" Pry said in a statement released by the school. \"Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the nation. \"Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources, facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys made this a very desirable situation.\nBLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Virginia Tech football\u2019s Beamerball \u2014 an idiosyncratic mix of Tidewater talent, special teams wizardry and Metallica entrances \u2014 made the Hokies a national brand, and Brent Pry was there. \u201cThis was Clemson before Clemson was Clemson,\u201d Pry said. Pry, a graduate assistant under legendary Hokies coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster from 1995 to 1997, left his defensive coordinator job at Penn State to sign a six-year contract as Virginia Tech\u2019s head coach in December. Now he\u2019s tasked with a balancing act of modernizing the program while maintaining the Beamer culture. And winning big. \u201cI was not trying to re-create \u2018Coach Beamer and Coach Bud 2.0,\u2019\u2009\u201d Athletic Director Whit Babcock said about hiring Pry. Virginia Tech is mindful of how it is messaging its second attempt at life after Beamer because the first one failed. When the program\u2019s architect and native son announced his retirement in 2015, Babcock moved swiftly to hire Justin Fuente, then the coach of a surging Memphis program and one of the hottest names in the industry.\nSuch a routine is standard for any new college football coach, but in a community welcoming only its third coach in just under 40 years, there is an eagerness to certify Pry\u2019s professed love of the school\u2019s culture. Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente\u2019s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach\u2019s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020, maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation of Tech. Chris Slade\u2019s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making \u201cEven though not many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell you they know Coach Beamer,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cThey have met him, they affiliate with him, because they want to know the head football coach.\u201d Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also hired Radford native Mike Young as men\u2019s basketball coach in 2019. But he has been wary of how native-son and former-assistant narratives can sour quickly if there aren\u2019t results.\nBLACKSBURG, Va. -- Brent Pry's voice cracked with emotion as he detailed the career journey he's been on, one that has brought him back to Blacksburg as Virginia Tech's head football coach. \"I'm honored and humbled,\" he said Thursday at a news conference. \"It's very surreal for me.\" After spending a dozen years on James Franklin's staff, the past eight at Penn State, Pry said he wasn't sure he would \"ever step out and do my own thing.\" \"It took this place to do it and took what coach [Frank Beamer] built and [former defensive coordinator Bud Foster] and so many others to be the right place,\" Pry said. \"For me, it was the right time.\" Beamer, who gave Pry a chance as a graduate assistant in 1995, and Foster, who had Pry working with the defensive line for three years as the program rose in status, attended Pry's introductory news conference. J.C. Price, the Hokies' interim coach who will lead Virginia Tech in their bowl game after Justin Fuente's exit on Nov. 16, was also in attendance. Pry has hired Price to be an associate head coach and defensive coach. The new coach said he will take his time and do his due diligence in building a staff.\nThe Virginia Tech Hokies college football team represents Virginia Tech in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The program has had 33\u00a0head coaches, and 1\u00a0interim head coach, since it began play during the 1892 season.[1]    Joseph V.

Scott has poured his heart and soul into the Nebraska football program both as a quarterback and head coach, and I appreciate his work and dedication. \u201cAfter the disappointing start to our season, I decided the best path forward for our program was to make a change in our head coaching position. Associate Head Coach Mickey Joseph will serve as our interim head coach for the remainder of the 2022 season.\u201d Joseph is in his first season at Nebraska where he played option quarterback from 1988 to 1991.

The former Archbishop Shaw star quarterback previously served as a head coach at Langston University in Oklahoma.

Nebraska is committing to interim head coach Mickey Joseph for the remainder of the 2022 season. Like Scott Frost, who Nebraska fired Sunday, Joseph is a former Husker quarterback. \u201cAfter the disappointing start to our season, I decided the best path forward for our program was to make a change in our head coaching position,\u201d Nebraska Athletic Director Trev Alberts said in a statement. Joseph, 54, is the first Black head coach at Nebraska in any sport and among four new members of the staff this season. \u201cTrev has made a good choice in asking Associate Coach Mickey Joseph to step in as interim head coach for the rest of the year and we eagerly look forward to his leadership,\u201d said UNL Chancellor Ronnie Green. He joined the program as the passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach this season, after the firings last fall. \u201cDifficult as this decision is, I fully support AD Alberts\u2019 path (forward), & I have complete confidence in Interim Coach Joseph. There\u2019s lots of football left to be played. Now is the time to rally around our players and give them our full support,\u201d said University of Nebraska President Ted Carter. Prior to joining Nebraska, Joseph served as an assistant head coach at LSU. Joseph was on the LSU staff when the school won the national championship in 2019.\nIn eleven seasons as head coach, Devaney won two national championships, eight conference titles, and coached twenty-two All-Americans, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[4] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973, and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-form offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[5][6][7] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.  \u2020 Interim head coach  \u2021 Claimed national titles in bold  # denotes interim head coach\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten,       or redistributed. \u00a92023 FOX News Network, LLC.

While it\u2019s still not known when Jackie\u2019s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it\u2019s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then. While the album unfortunately doesn\u2019t have \u2018Big Yellow Taxi\u2019 (a song that I reckon, is Joni\u2019s biggest radio hit), these 10 tracks still convey Joni\u2019s own impact and influence on music, full stop. While Jackie\u2019s been out for some time, it\u2019s great that she\u2019s able to return, and to return with a Joni tribute album, is one of the best ways to make a splash back into the music industry.\n...essential Jackie Evancho was nationally recognized as a powerful vocal force as a young 10-year old contestant on America\u2019s Got Talent. Since then, she has gone on to release 8 solo albums across several genres of music. Her last album was The Debut, issued in 2019. It was a collection of broadway songs as sung by Jackie.\u00a0 On September 9, Jackie Evancho returns with a new album to be called Carousel Of Time. It will contain 10 covers of Joni Mitchell songs in the unmistakable Evancho style. Joni Mitchell is a popular and influential artist that has deservedly captured the attention of many artists in new interpretations of classic tracks that include the timeless, \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d. The recently released \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d single can be heard below. Two other singles are also in release that include \u201cA Case Of You\u201d, and \u201cRiver\u201d.  \u00a0 Carousel Of Time will be issued via new label, Melody Place Music.

Ever since being the runner-up to America\u2019s Got Talent way back in 2011, it\u2019s been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn\u2019t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is undervalued, to say the least. Jackie\u2019s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence\u2013 highlighting her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she\u2019s covered not in English as well.

The MAANG group is an extension of FAANG, the term was coined after Facebook was transformed into Meta Platforms. As a result, the \u201cF\u201d letter was replaced with \u201cM\u201d. Further in this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. The MATANA group is composed of six high-level technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc. These giants are regarded as a powerful tech group driving many of the biggest innovations in the world. In terms of market dominance, the stocks of the MATANA group make up almost 50% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Therefore, these companies have a significant influence on the tech market\u2019s returns. This has led the MATANA group to replace the FAANG group as a reference in the tech industry. Moreover, each of the companies comprising the MATANA group has successfully dominated its respective sector. Below are some milestones these tech giants achieved in 2023.\nCompared to other prominent groups like FANG, FAANG, or MAMAA, MATANA has a lot to offer to investors. However, it remains to be seen whether the AI boom will become the future of the technology industry or if it will only be a passing trend because many of these companies are increasing their profits thanks to AI. The MATANA group is composed of the six largest and most influential technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). These companies are recognized for their significant market presence, innovation, and dominance in their respective sectors. According to Nasdaq, Alphabet stock is considered the best in the MATANA group for long-term investment.\u00a0This recommendation is based on Alphabet\u2019s market dominance in search, particularly with Google holding a 76% dominance compared to other search engines. Analysts believe that this market position will continue to drive Alphabet\u2019s long-term growth through its advertising offerings. Additionally, Alphabet has diversified its business beyond searches, expanding into areas such as digital advertising, cloud services, and artificial intelligence (IA). FAANG is an acronym that stands for Facebook (now called Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now called Alphabet). These are some of the most prominent and well-known technology stocks in the market.\nAdd your comments to the blog or reach me via email: R (at) ConstellationR (dot) com or R (at) SoftwareInsider (dot) org.

Since they influence the benchmark\u2019s day-to-day returns so much, growth investors should be well-versed in how these companies perform.\u00a0 The MATANA group has largely replaced FAANG as the tech sector bellwether.

In the following list, the first titles listed in gold are the winners; those not in gold are nominees, which are listed in alphabetical order. The years given are those in which the ceremonies took place.  Animated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year.[citation needed] The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994[1] while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009.[2] Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.  Prior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.[citation needed]\nBy Peter White  Television Editor Call it third time lucky. Netflix has finally won Best Animated Program at the Emmys with Arcane picking up the award at the Creative Arts ceremony. It marks the first time that a streaming show has picked up the award. It beat Bob\u2019s Burgers, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons and Chadwick Boseman-voiced What If\u2026? in the hotly contested category. Other streaming contenders in the past have included Netflix\u2019s Big Mouth and BoJack Horseman. Arcane co-creator Christian Linke picked up the award. \u201cThank you this.

On Friday, the Board of Managers that oversees the CFP unanimously voted to expand the Playoff from four teams to 12. The larger field will begin with the 2026 season, though the College Football Management Committee will look into possibly moving up to the 12-team field for the 2024 or 2025 season. The 12-team Playoff will be made up of the six conference champions ranked highest by the committee, with no minimum ranking requirement, and the six highest-ranked teams not among the conference champions. The four highest-ranked conference champions will be seeded Nos. 1 through 4 and will receive a first-round bye. The other eight CFP teams would play in the first round (No. 12 at No. 5, No. 11 at No. 6, No. 10 at No. 7, No. 9 at No. 8) held at the higher seed on a campus site or another location selected by the higher seed.

The College Football Playoff officially confirmed the 2024-25 timeline for the expansion on Thursday. \"We're delighted to be moving forward,\" Bill Hancock, Executive Director of the College Football Playoff, said per the release. \"When the board expanded the playoff beginning in 2026 and asked the CFP Management Committee to examine the feasibility of starting the new format earlier, the Management Committee went right to work. \"More teams and more access mean more excitement for fans, alumni, students and student-athletes. We appreciate the leaders of the six bowl games and the two future national championship game host cities for their cooperation.

Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]  The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day.\nWorld Cup 30  Qatar had to wait 4371 days to play their first World Cup match on home soil after being announced as the hosts of the 2022 tournament by FIFA on December 2, 2010. And now the tournament they have waited so long for is over \u2014 in a sense \u2014 after just nine days. Qatar lost the opening match of the 2022 World Cup when they fell 2-0 to Ecuador.

But, despite an improved performance, Qatar were defeated again, losing 3-1, leaving them on the verge of being eliminated from their own tournament at the first hurdle.

GO DEEPER The Radar - The Athletic's 2022 World Cup scouting guide Yes. Qatar\u2019s second loss leaves them bottom of Group A with zero points. The Netherlands and Ecuador are both on four points, while Senegal are on three. While Qatar could beat The Netherlands in their final game, they will not be able to overtake them. They also cannot overtake Ecuador, and if Senegal beat Ecuador to get second spot, then Qatar will not be able to catch them either. Third place is the best Qatar can hope for now.\nMark Ogden has a look around Ras Abu Fontas fan village ten miles south of downtown Doha. (1:56) Qatar became the first team eliminated at the 2022 World Cup after suffering defeats in their opening two fixtures, the earliest exit by a host nation in the tournament's 92-year history. Qatar, who were controversially awarded the hosting rights in 2010, became the first host country to lose the opening game of the tournament when they were beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday before losing 3-1 to Senegal on Friday. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Their hopes of advancing to the knockout stages were ended on later on Friday when Netherlands draw 1-1 to Ecuador. Qatar face an uphill task of achieving a win in their final group game as they face Netherlands on Friday, with the European nation needing a win to guarantee qualification to the round of 16. South Africa (2010) are the only other host team to be eliminated in the group stage, although the African side at least went out with a win and a draw from their three games. \"If you expected us to go very far in this tournament, then it will be a disappointment,\" Qatar coach F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez said before his team was officially out. \"Our goal was to be competitive. \"We have to forget about today, move on and play the Netherlands.\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition.

                "value": "The Malaysian defense contractor who pleaded guilty to bribing Navy officials with sex parties, fancy dinners and alcohol in a massive corruption scandal has escaped just weeks before his sentencing date. Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as \u201cFat Leonard\u201d for his overshadowing frame, fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A multiagency search by the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force and Naval Criminal Investigative Service is underway, officials said. \u201cHe cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet on Sunday morning,\u201d the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. \u201cTask Force Officers went to his residence and upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.\u201d The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies \u201cto locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,\u201d a service spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cOut of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time,\u201d the spokesperson added.  Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at Francis\u2019s home, Supervisory Deputy Omar Castillo with the U.S. Marshals\u2019 district in Southern California told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cHe was planning this out, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Castillo told the newspaper, which was the first to report Francis\u2019s escape. Castillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\u201cI was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,\u201d Sammartino added, according to the transcript. \u201cSo that\u2019s the only thing. It\u2019s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.\u201d Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis\u2019s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. \u201cLeonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,\u201d Mancano said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s lived his life. So he\u2019s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn\u2019t planning [his escape] for a long time.\nThe rules laid out in federal court were clear: Leonard Glenn Francis, the Malaysian defense contractor who admitted bribing dozens of Navy officers as part of a $35 million fraud scheme, would remain in home confinement under tight, 24-7 security while he provided evidence against corrupt Navy personnel. Only approved visitors could enter the home. An ankle monitor would alert authorities should he somehow slip away. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d one of his defense attorneys, Devin Burstein, assured the judge in late 2020. But the criminal mastermind known as \u201cFat Leonard\u201d because of his 6-2, 350-pound frame eventually did go somewhere, cutting off his ankle monitor this past Labor Day weekend and fleeing the San Diego mansion where he had been living with private security staff that he paid for under a court-approved deal meant to prevent his escape. He was captured after 16 days on the run, caught Tuesday at an airport in Venezuela from which he was headed to Russia after earlier stops in Mexico and Cuba, according to Interpol. Interpol\u2019s Venezuela director general, Carlos Ga\u0301rate Rondo\u0301n, said the 57-year-old Francis would be handed over to judicial authorities to begin the paperwork for extradition. The international manhunt for Francis renewed interest in his long-running case and the way he outmaneuvered federal authorities in escaping weeks before his sentencing.\nSince pleading guilty in 2015, Francis has worked as a cooperating witness for federal prosecutors building cases against others involved in the plot \u2014 and shared evidence, including records from Glenn Defense Marine Asia\u2019s computer servers. The man who seduced the 7th Fleet Following health complications \u2014 including a bout with kidney cancer, swollen knees and a hernia, according to court records \u2014 Francis was released from federal detention in 2018 and has been held under house arrest. His home is under surveillance by a security entourage for which he pays. But that arrangement was one that prosecutors had fought against in 2013 and 2015 \u2014 arguing that he might try fleeing for the Mexican border, The Post reported. That\u2019s one of the scenarios authorities are contending with almost a decade later. Castillo told the Union-Tribune that international borders and airports are on alert, but Francis might have already crossed into Mexico. Craig Whitlock contributed to this report. A previous version of this story stated that the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Leonard Glenn Francis might have crossed the Rio Grande, according to a U.S. Marshals Service official. The paper reported Francis might have crossed into Mexico. The story has been updated.\nUnknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property \u2013 he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents \u2013 for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks \u201ccoming in and out of the residence,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThere was more than one\u201d seen on Friday or Saturday. Undated photo of Leonard Francis \u201cWe are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of now, we think he\u2019s probably going international. It sounds like he\u2019s been planning this for a while.\u201d Castillo said he didn\u2019t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis\u2019 residence.\u00a0He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. \u201cI can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was there.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors\u2019 support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis\u2019 residence.\nQuestion:Where did Leonard Francis escape from?\nAnswer:"

The event, which focuses on Meta's developments in the augmented and virtual reality spaces, is set for September 27th and 28th, according to its website. Connect is taking place a little earlier than usual this year. The 2022 edition happened in October. More details about Connect 2023 are coming soon, but one thing's for sure: we'll learn much more about the Quest 3 in late September. Meta's next virtual reality headset will be available sometime this fall and it'll start at $500. The company says the Quest 3 is its \"most powerful headset yet.\" It will offer full-color passthrough to support mixed reality experiences. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the latest model will have twice the graphics performance of the Quest 2.

Meta Connect takes place in digital format streamed via Facebook for the third year in a row on October 11, starting at 1 p.m. EST. The highlight of the conference is the keynote, where Mark Zuckerberg is anticipated to present Meta Quest Pro (info) and announce Meta's next metaverse projects. Immediately following, John Carmack is expected to stream live from Virtual Reality and give his (blunt) take on the State of Play.

After the main event, the Developer Sessions go online. These pre-recorded videos feature talks from Meta developers and other industry representatives. The Meta Connect 2022 program has recently been listed on the official website including the Developer Sessions. These could give a glimpse of what the conference will focus on, as well as hint at what new features Meta has up its sleeve. At least three talks are dedicated to the Presence Platform, Meta's mixed reality interfaces. The platform should become even more important with high-quality passthrough on the Meta Quest Pro. One of the talks will focus on new features of the platform that are expected to contribute to the next generation of mixed reality experiences.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg will lay out the company's latest updates on the metaverse at the virtual event.    Meta Connect, the tech giant's annual virtual reality conference, will take place on Oct. 11 this year, the company said on Tuesday.

In August, Zuckerberg said that the headset would come out in October and that more details would be revealed at Connect.\u00a0 The virtual event will be livestreamed on the\u00a0Reality Labs Facebook page\u00a0at 7 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT on Oct. 11.\nA new site that reads \"Welcome to Meta Connect\" teases the one-day Meta Connect event with a live countdown to October 11th. This event will focus on the topic of the metaverse and explore the future of augmented and virtual reality.\u00a0 The Connect event is not a new concept, with the first one dating back to 2014 when Facebook acquired Oculus. The event was originally called Oculus Connect, then rebranded to Facebook Connect, and finally to what we have today \u2013 Meta Connect.\u00a0 As VR enters a critical adoption phase, these headsets offer a fully immersive experience. These events take an in-depth look at the future of AR and VR with insight from industry leaders and discussions. The website currently says more information and speaker details are coming soon.

The next platform and medium will be even more immersive, an embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse. And you\u2019re going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine, get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create as well as entirely new categories that don\u2019t really fit how we think about computers or phones today.

Mark Zuckerberg: (00:39) So we\u2019ve put together something that I think is really going to give you a feeling for what this future could be like.

In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition company Clearview AI \u00a37.5m \u2013 the third largest it has imposed \u2013 for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn images of people\u2019s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.\nThe company says it will appeal the fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission.    Meta faces a hefty GDPR fine for its handling of children's data. Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision.

Instagram plans to appeal against the fine, a spokesperson for its parent company, Meta, said in an emailed statement.           The investigation, which started in 2020, focused on child users between the ages of 13 and 17 who were allowed to operate business accounts, which facilitated the publication of the user\u2019s phone number and/or email address.           \u201cWe adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of 405 million euro,\u201d said the spokesperson for Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, the lead regulator of Instagram and Facebook\u2019s                              (FB) parent company.

The Irish DPC acts as the EU's regulator for several US tech giants including Meta because their headquarters are based in the country. The DPC fine was given to Instagram for failing to protect children's privacy on its platform. The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed. The DPC also found the accounts of 13 to 17 year-olds were set to \"public\" as their default setting. A DPC spokesperson told Insider full details of the ruling will be published next week. A Meta spokesperson told Insider in a statement: \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private.\" The spokesperson added Instagram users under the age of 18 automatically have their accounts set to \"private\" rather than \"public.\" He added adult users can't privately message users under 18 unless they follow the adult's account. \"While we've engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it.

The penalty will be the largest to date handed down by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the primary European data regulator for the social media giant. It is the third fine in the past year against a subsidiary of Meta, following sanctions of \u20ac17 million (then-U.S. $18.6 million) in March against Meta Ireland (formerly Facebook Ireland) and \u20ac225 million (then-U.S. $267 million) in September 2021 against WhatsApp. The Instagram fine will be the second largest imposed under the GDPR, behind a \u20ac746 million (U.S. $739 million) penalty weighed against Amazon in Luxembourg last year. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Irish DPC confirmed it adopted its final decision Friday regarding the Instagram fine. Full details in the case are expected to be published next week. A spokesperson for Meta said the company intends to appeal the decision. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.\nQuestion:How much is the fine that Meta is facing for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram?\nAnswer:"

He brawls with Ra's al Ghul for what feels like 20 minutes and is eventually crushed by the debris of a crumbling bat cave. The game's heroes find his body in the rubble, clutching his mask in one hand. Batman's death is the setup for a game that wants to distance itself from the Arkham series and introduce four bat prot\u00e9g\u00e9s as worthy replacements. But Gotham Knights wasn't ready to let go of the Dark Knight.\n32] The Windows port was developed by Polish studio QLOC.[33]  Gotham Knights was revealed during a virtual event called DC FanDome in August 2020.

While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.  Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game.

Social media users were quick to observe the Queen\u2019s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, \u201cghostly\u201d appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen\u2019s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was \u201cin quite good spirits.\u201d On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30.\n249] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7\u00a0September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[250]  Elizabeth never planned to abdicate,[251] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[252] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition. Although, I suppose if I became completely gaga, one would have to do something\".[253] In June 2022, Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who \"came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength.\"[254]  On 8\u00a0September 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\"[255][256] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.[257][258] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side.\nQueen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning British monarch whose rule spanned seven decades, died on Thursday at the age of 96, Buckingham Palace has announced.

The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow,\u201d the royal family said in a statement posted on its official Twitter account, referring to Charles as the new King for the first time.

Crowds of mourners gathered outside Balmoral Castle and other royal residences, despite heavy downpours in parts of the UK on Thursday evening. Many brought flowers and lit candles, some looking visibly shaken by the news.           In keeping with the royal tradition, a written statement announcing the Queen\u2019s death was displayed on the gates of Buckingham Palace.\nOn 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19\u00a0September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nQueen Elizabeth II died of old age, her death certificate has revealed.           The document, published by National Records of Scotland on Thursday, says the late British monarch died at 3:10 p.m. UK time (10:10 a.m. ET) on September 8 at Balmoral Castle in Ballater, Scotland.           The cause of death is listed as old age. The document is signed by the Queen\u2019s daughter, Princess Anne.            Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch died peacefully aged 96.           Her death set into motion a period of national mourning. King Charles III, who ascended to the throne following his mother\u2019s death, was formally proclaimed as the United Kingdom\u2019s new monarch on September 10.

She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a \"moment of great sadness\" for him and his family and that her loss would be \"deeply felt\" around the world. He said: \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother.  \"I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\" During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be \"comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held\". The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there.\nElizabeth\u00a0II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21\u00a0April 1926\u00a0\u2013 8\u00a0September 2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6\u00a0February 1952 until her death in 2022. She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.  Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George\u00a0VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward\u00a0VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\n249] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7\u00a0September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[250]  Elizabeth never planned to abdicate,[251] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[252] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition.

He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardaman\u0121a, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]  As George\u00a0VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6\u00a0February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth\u00a0II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.\nBecky Sullivan                        Queen Elizabeth II pictured in 2012.

Up against an opponent brimming with confidence and the crackling Arthur Ashe Stadium atmosphere of nearly 24,000 spectators largely in the American\u2019s corner, Alcaraz conjured his best tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further building on his reputation as the best teenager in men\u2019s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two decades ago.

Here\u2019s a look at Alcaraz\u2019s journey: Alcaraz got a bit of a break in the first round against Sebastian Baez, the Argentine ranked No. 37, on a particularly hot and humid day at the tournament. After Alcaraz took the first two sets, 7-5, 7-5, Baez was forced to retire in the third set, down two games to none, with an injury. After the match, Alcaraz said in a news conference that the conditions were \u201creally tough.\u201d \u201cThe heat was pretty tough, so I\u2019m just really happy with the level and be able to play the second round,\u201d he said.

Watch the ceremony in the video player above. At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward\u2019s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, \u201cI come not to be served but to serve,\u201d and was presented as Britain\u2019s \u201cundoubted king.\u201d Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted \u201cGod save the king!\u201d Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch.\nfirst lady Jill Biden, first lady Olena Zelenska of Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron, eight current and former British prime ministers, judges in wigs, soldiers with gleaming medals, and celebrities including Judi Dench, Emma Thompson and Lionel Richie. During the traditional Anglican service slightly tweaked for modern times, Charles, clad in crimson and cream velvet and ermine-trimmed robes, swore on a Bible that he is a \u201ctrue Protestant.\u201d But a preface was added to the coronation oath to say the Anglican church \u201cwill seek to foster an environment where people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.\u201d It was the first ceremony to include representatives of the Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, as well as the first in which female clergy took part. Charles was anointed with oil from the Mount of Olives in the Holy Land \u2014 a part of the ceremony so sacred it was concealed behind screens \u2014 before being presented with the Sovereign\u2019s Orb and other regalia.

Though Charles officially became king following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Sept. 8, 2022, today's coronation ceremony consecrated and celebrated his ascent to the throne. Follow along below for the latest updates as the ceremony unfolded:\u00a0 King Charles and Queen Camilla stepped out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace Saturday with other senior members of their family to watch a military fly-past and greet members of the public. They were joined by other \"working\" members of the royal family, including William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children.\u00a0 As part of the \"slimmed down\" coronation day events requested by the king, not all members of their large family joined them.\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla during their coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey, London, May 6, 2023.

To the crowds gathered under rainy skies \u2014 thousands of whom had camped overnight \u2014 it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor from Canada, said the royal procession had been \u201cabsolutely fabulous. Couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,\u201d she added. But to millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become a republic gathered to holler \u201cNot my king.\u201d They see the monarchy as an institution that stands for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties. A handful were arrested.

I\u2019ve just kind of done my own thing, haven\u2019t had to really lean on anybody too much for a lot of advice.\" Adkins, who isn't a stranger to acting, with previous stints on television and in the recent movies \"Old Henry,\" \"Apache Junction\" and \"Badland,\" said playing Albie, his character on \"Monarch,\" wasn't too big of a stretch. \"He's a no-nonsense kind of guy, and I\u2019m kind of that way too,\" Adkins admitted. \"He\u2019s not very animated, and neither am I. We say what we\u2019ve gotta say, and don\u2019t have to yell it \u2026 just kind of move through this life as softly and peacefully as they\u2019ll allow us to, but when they don\u2019t \u2013 we'll do what we\u2019ve gotta do.\nSusan Sarandon and Trace Adkins lead the star-studded cast.

This show is loaded with seasoned Hollywood and country music stars, as well as newcomers offering fresh charisma for the camera. Those who have seen the trailer already know that Oscar-award-winning legend Susan Sarandon and country music singer Trace Adkins will star alongside each other in the upcoming series.

He also has a host of Academy of Country Music Awards, in addition to Grammy Award nominations. But the \"You're Gonna Miss This\" singer admitted he was a little intimidated to work with legendary actress Susan Sarandon in their upcoming country music drama about a dynasty of singers in \"Monarch.\" Adkins portrays Albie Roman alongside Sarandon, who plays Dottie Cantrell Roman, in the series, which is set to debut in September on FOX, and marks his first starring role.\u00a0 He told Fox News Digital that working with Sarandon was \"terrifying,\" but he knew he was learning the ropes from a true icon. \"It was terrifying at first, but then very quickly I realized that she is so good, so professional, that she is going to carry the scene,\" Adkins said. \"You just try to hang on and make it to the buzzer, and she\u2019ll take care of it.

He joins previously announced cast members Susan Sarandon and Anna Friel. Adkins will portray Albie Roman \u2014 Texas Truthteller, reigning King of Country Music and husband of Dottie Cantrell Roman (Sarandon), known as the tough-as-nails Queen of Country Music, with whom he has helped create a country music dynasty. The Romans, whose name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. And when their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette \u201cNicky\u201d Roman (Friel) will stop at nothing to protect her family\u2019s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom.            Fox Day @ TCA: Deadline\u2019s Full Coverage Created by Melissa London Hilfers,\u00a0Monarch is described as a Texas-sized, multigenerational musical drama about America\u2019s first family of country music. The series debuts with a special two-night event beginning Sunday, Jan. 30, immediately following the NFC Championship Game and continuing on Tuesday, Feb. 1. Adkins is repped by Greg Baker & Associates; Nick Meinema is with Action Entertainment, and Michael Reinert is repped by Fox Rothschild LLP.\nThe upcoming Fox series boasts strong ties to the real Nashville, including cameos by a host of country stars and a theme song by Music City songwriting royalty  Trace Adkins says he truly met his match when he was offered the role of Albie Roman, the patriarch in Monarch, the much-anticipated Fox primetime drama set in the country music scene.   \"He's very much like me,\" the 60-year-old country hitmaker tells PEOPLE. \"I mean, I can look back over periods in my life where the train was perpetually off the track, and that's Albie's world. The train is perpetually off the track. Sometimes it's his fault, sometimes it's not, but he has to deal with that stuff.\"   Indeed, Adkins has had his share of tabloid headlines over the years \u2014 but forgive him for forgetting one more glaringly obvious reason that the part fits him to a T: The singer and his character are both big-time country stars. And obviously, Adkins' casting is just one of the ways the show, which is set in Austin, is sure to bring a country music authenticity to what promises to be one of the fall's hottest \u2014 and steamiest \u2014 new shows.\nQuestion:What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?\nAnswer:"

Presented initially as a kind of takeoff on the burgeoning true-crime corner of the media marketplace, what emerges in Sophie Kargman\u2019s debut feature is something else entirely, at once a meditation on our era\u2019s obsession with fame and a psychological portrait of a lonely young woman determined to escape the narrow contours of her life by any means necessary. Clemons is terrific in embodying Susie\u2019s many contradictions, her sunny awkward demeanor covering dark ambition. Sherin Nicole  Everyone\u2014no matter how nefarious or nice\u2014is the hero of their story. This gives antagonists and anti-heroes their pull. It also draws us into Susie Searches. But there\u2019s something else. Those of us who stand behind the curtain of influencer-based entertainment are often like The Wizard, wearing a grand mask to hide fragilities or darker things. Read more Jamie Broadnax Susie Searches is filled with whimsy and its lead, Kiersey Clemons, offers a flavor of quirkiness that makes this film pretty exceptional. Clemons plays the titular character Susie, an inquisitive girl who runs a true crime podcast.  Her curiosity gets the best of her when a fellow classmate Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, which leads down an unexpected dark path.\nWhen fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she\u2019s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she\u2019s flooded with fans and fame.\u00a0 There\u2019s an element of the \u201csearch\u201d as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie\u2019s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She\u2019s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez\u00a0composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist\u2019s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn\u2019t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes\u00a0Susie Searches much more, and\u00a0 Clemon\u2019s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.\u00a0 Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie\u2019s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.\nSusie hopes to become an internet sensation, and make enough money to give her and her mother, now bed-ridden with MS, a more comfortable life.

As Susie, Kiersey Clemons is impressive, as the title character finds her way through the plot\u2019s twists.

And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in 2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy to RCR, it will be Busch.\nBy Alex Zietlow  Kyle Busch is moving from one storied racing team to another. The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.\nBusch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. \u2013 announced in December 2021 \u2013 that it would end its NASCAR sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come \u201cclose\u201d on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch\u2019s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch\u2019s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.\nKyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans! Toyota, speaks to Victoria B. Mars on the ... [+] grid during qualifying for the Nascar Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway. (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images) No one really believed that Kyle Busch would actually leave Joe Gibbs Racing following months of failed sponsorship talks, but here we are. The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and Mars Wrigley \u2014 his primary sponsor until 2022 \u2014 always had his back. Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own. But when an unreported company backed out late in the going, it left JGR with little time to find a new multi-million dollar primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 car. In return, team owner Joe Gibbs\u2019 grandson Ty Gibbs will take over the car, which moves the No. 54, in 2023. Now, Busch will focus on his return to Chevrolet, the manufacturer that believed in him from the start.\n36  Editor\u2019s Note: This story is included in The Athletic\u2019s Best of 2022. View the full list.  Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he\u2019d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team\u2019s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars\u2019 eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.\nQuestion:Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?\nAnswer:"

At least seven players 25-and-under finished in the Top 10 for the second year in a row (8 in 2021). Joining Alcaraz, Auger-Aliassime and Fritz in the 2022 year-end Top 10 are 23-year-old Casper Ruud of Norway, 24-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece and 25-year-olds Andrey Rublev and Hubert Hurkacz. 2022 Year-End Pepperstone ATP Rankings Top 10 1) Carlos Alcaraz \u2013 Second Spanish year-end No. 1, joining five-time year-end No. 1 Rafael Nadal 2) Rafael Nadal \u2013 Ends year at No. 2 for eighth time and in Top 2 for record 13th time 3) Casper Ruud \u2013 Best year-end ranking for a Scandinavian player since No.\nWhen Rafael Nadal was eliminated from semi-final contention at the Nitto ATP Finals on Tuesday evening, history was made. Nineteen-year-old Carlos Alcaraz will become the youngest year-end ATP No. 1 presented by Pepperstone in history (since 1973), making him the first teen to accomplish the feat. The Spaniard has enjoyed an unforgettable rise in 2022, ascending from World No. 32 at the start of the year to the top of the men\u2019s tennis mountain on 12 September. That is the biggest jump to No. 1 in 50 editions of the year-end Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Before this year, the youngest year-end ATP No. 1 was Lleyton Hewitt, who was aged 20 years, 275 days when he did it in 2001. Alcaraz will be 19 years, 214 days on 5 December, the 2022 year-end ranking date following the last ATP Challenger Tour events of the season. Alcaraz is the 18th year-end ATP No. 1 presented by Pepperstone in history and the first outside the Big Four of Novak Djokovic (7), Roger Federer (5), Nadal (5) and Andy Murray (1) since Andy Roddick in 2003.\nIt was a record-breaking year for Carlos Alcaraz as the teenager surged to the top of the ATP Rankings and became the youngest-ever year-end No 1, but a few players also notched up some milestones in the 2022 ATP year-end rankings. The 2022 season-ending ATP Rankings has finally been ratified following the conclusion of the ATP Challenger Tour and it is a Spain 1-2 at the top with Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal sitting pretty at the top. Alcaraz, who started the year at No 32, finishes as world No 1 on the back of winning his maiden Grand Slam, the US Open, as well as two ATP Masters 1000 events and two ATP 500 tournaments. The Spaniard won the joint-most titles (5) along with Novak Djokovic this year. 1. Carlos Alcaraz Spain 6,820 points 2. Rafael Nadal Spain 6,020 3. Casper Ruud Norway 5,820 4.

It\u2019s not apples to apples like other years.\u201d Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP\u2019s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic\u2019s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) \u201cMost of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,\u201d Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. \u201cHe missed two majors and didn\u2019t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.\u201d The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid. In Madrid, he beat Nadal, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev in succession.\nThese tables present the number of singles (S), doubles (D), and mixed doubles (X) titles won by each player and each nation during the season, within all the tournament categories of the 2022 calendar\u00a0: the Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP Finals, the ATP Tour Masters 1000, the ATP Tour 500 tournaments, and the ATP Tour 250 tournaments.

But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most unexpected call I've ever had.\" As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor\u2019s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The actor discusses how he shaped a new version of the villain, including his Einstein and 'Jaws' influences, as well as the significance of Superman's absence for both the show and Superboy.   \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tAbbey White  Associate Editor & News Writer  [This story contains spoilers for the premiere episode of Titans season four \u201cLex Luthor.\u201d]  \tIn its season four return, HBO Max\u2019s Titans introduces Lex Luthor, one of Superman\u2019s greatest foes, and in the same hour kills him off.     \tBut before he goes, in yet another unexpected twist, Lex \u2014 who is revealed to have a terminal illness \u2014 leaves Joshua Orpin\u2019s Superboy his empire and legacy, Lexcorp. Lex\u2019s arrival is not only surprising for the Titan, but comes at a particularly interesting time after Superman fails to show up for the young hero.   \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t             \t \tTV \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Bosch: Legacy' Nabs Third Season at Amazon Freevee\t\t \t\t\t               \t \tTV \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Titans,' 'Doom Patrol' Ending on HBO Max\nTitans is introducing its own version of Lex Luthor, and the dastardly foe of Superman is played by an actor familiar to fans of the series Lost. Titans is leaving Gotham City and heading to Metropolis in its newest season, and it's bringing that city's biggest bad into the story. Superman's nemesis Lex Luthor is a major figure in the show's fourth season, and he's played by a veteran actor. Titus Welliver portrays the villain in the HBO Max TV series, and he's got the chops to be the best Lex Luthor yet. Known for playing somewhat hard-edged characters, Welliver is one of many who's taken on the role of Superman's arch-enemy. Set to make a big impact on the show Titans, Welliver will be the dark daddy of the show's Conner Kent. Here's a look at Welliver's filmography, and how he might stack up against past versions of Lex. RELATED: Titans' Superman Debut is Following the Thanos Formula - and It Works  Beginning his professional acting career in the early 1990s, Titus Welliver is perhaps more well-known for his TV roles. This included roles in several science fiction favorites back in the '90s, including TV series' such as The X-Files, Star Trek: Voyager and The CW's long-running show Supernatural.\nThe fourth season of the HBO Max superhero series Titans will bring in Bosch star Titus Welliver as iconic DC villain Lex Luthor. Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman\u2019s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor\u2019s arrival since season two when Conner/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character\u2019s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer\u2019s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).  Related: Future of Doom Patrol & Titans Uncertain Amid DCEU Shake-Up Titus Welliver is best known for his starring role in Amazon\u2019s acclaimed police procedural, Bosch.\nSuperhero stories are so common in movies and TV now that you can't expect every actor involved in such a production to be a lifelong fan of the material, but sometimes you get lucky. Titans showrunner Greg Walker previously told EW that when he reached out to actor Titus Welliver about portraying iconic DC supervillain Lex Luthor in season 4, he was surprised to find that Welliver was already well-versed in the comic book history of the Teen Titans.\u00a0 \"I've been collecting comic books since I was 7 or 8 years old,\" Welliver tells EW. \"I'm 60 now, so that's a lot of comic books.\"\u00a0 He has the nerd knowledge to prove it, too. Check out EW's conversation with Welliver about Luthor and all things Titans below.\u00a0 ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What first got you interested in the Teen Titans?\u00a0 TITUS WELLIVER: I love the period in the late '60s and the '70s when they're less clean-cut, their hair is longer, they're kind of hip, they're go-go dancing. I had always read the comics. I mean, I have all the omnibuses, plus I still have all of my original collection.\u00a0 So when somebody calls you up on the phone and says, \"Do you want to play Lex Luthor?\" The immediate answer is yes.\nQuestion:Who was playing Lex Luthor in Titans?\nAnswer:"

The news sent US stock markets into a tailspin, with the Dow Jones index losing nearly 1,300 points. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly cost of living survey, found prices were 8.3% higher last month compared with August last year. The figure was down from an annual rate of 8.5% recorded in July and 9.1% in June, the highest rate in four decades. But despite the declining headline rate, the details of the report showed prices rising across a wide range of goods and services and triggered a sharp selloff on Wall Street, the worst since June 2020. The Dow closed nearly 4% lower, at 31104.97, the S&P fell 4.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped over 5% as investors sold companies across the board from airlines and construction to retail and technology. Falling gas prices were the major contributor to the overall drop in August\u2019s CPI. Gas prices have fallen for 13 weeks in a row. Nationally, a gallon of gas currently costs an average of $3.71, according to AAA, down from a high of over $5 in June.\nPrint   U.S. consumer price increases eased in August compared to a year ago, the government said Tuesday, but the drop was modest and may not be noticed much by financially squeezed American households.  The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks \u2014 down 10.6% from their peak \u2014 costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.  President Joe Biden adopted a more optimistic view, saying, \"Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two months. That is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do.  \"Gas prices are down an average of $1.\nU.S. Inflation Remained High in August Listen (2 min) U.S. Inflation Remained High in August Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Data released Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that inflation landed at 8.3% last month compared to one year ago. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an 8.1% annual increase. Prices increased 8.5% in July.  Excluding volatile food and gas prices, inflation climbed 6.3%\u00a0year-on-year \u2014 higher than the consensus estimate for 6.1% and an increase from last month's 5.9% reading.  The energy index rose 23.8% over the past 12 months. That includes the cost of electricity, which saw its largest one-year increase (15.8%) in four decades, according to the data.  Other categories that saw increases in August include motor vehicle maintenance and repair, up 1.7%; health insurance, up 2.4%; and pets and pet products, up 1.6% in the 30-day period between July and August.    Gas prices have fallen for three consecutive months and now stand at a national average of $3.70 a gallon, though there is wide geographic variability, with most Western states still above $4.

Photos:Lil Nas X brings stunning fashion and spectacular dance to ACL Fest It is far too early to start speculating about next year's lineup, but we will note that C3 Presents, the company behind the festival, has announced the lineup for next year's Latin American Lollapaloozas. The events, which take place in Argentina, Chile and Brazil in March, will be headlined by Drake, Billie Eilish, Blink-182, Tame Impala, Rosal\u00eda and Lil Nas X. Billie and Nas just headlined the fest and the Blink-sters are playing the Moody Center next July. But Drake, Tame Impala and Rosal\u00eda all seem like solid bets for next year's lineup.\nThe 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL'23) will take place in Toronto, Canada from July 9th to July 14th, 2023.\nJoin the Subreddit ACLFestival Discord Server: https://discord.gg/X97GkbW4               Okay folks, closing this thing down. It's almost 10pm eastern and it's extremely unlikely anything new will drop before tomorrow morning. Thanks for playing along! I'll see you nerds next year.   Last update: May 8th @ 10:00pm EST       And\u2026WE\u2019RE BACK!!! I am now on year SEVEN of doing this speculation thread and I'm proud to keep this train rolling. This will be our subreddit's ongoing hub of all things rumors, predictions, who\u2019s in/who\u2019s out, etc until we get the lineup.         Quick notes on my process:         I am assuming acts that play in Central Texas before May to be in play. There is precedence (albeit a limited one) for acts to play in May and still make it on the bill but 99% of the time, if they play May or later, they are out for ACL.         I will not include any acts that played ACL in the past two years. While I know there are some very limited cases of artists playing twice in a three-year span, it would be overkill to track over 300+ acts when 99% of them are out. Only in very obvious cases will I track a '21 or '22 act.\nApple is sponsoring the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which will take place in person from July 9\u2026\nToronto, CanadaJuly 9-14, 2023  The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL\u201923) will take place in Toronto, Canada from July 9th to July 14th, 2023.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. EMNLP 2023 will follow EMNLP 2022 and ACL 2023 and go with a hybrid format with respect to ARR. This means that while EMNLP will accept ARR-reviewed papers, it will also accept submissions directly to EMNLP. However, in order to keep the review load on the community as a whole manageable, we need to ask authors to decide up-front if they want to be reviewed through ARR or EMNLP. Mandatory abstract submission\nThe NLLP Workshop 2023 will take place on 7 December 2023 and will be co-located with the EMNLP 2023 conference in Singapore.

All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (\u201canywhere on Earth\u201d).\nPapers submitted directly to EMNLP will have the \u201cregular\u201d review process: paper reviewed by 3 reviewers, authors are invited to write an author response and revise their paper before the camera ready deadline, if accepted. ARR papers committed to EMNLP will be handled by the Senior Area Chairs. For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required \u201climitations\u201d section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below). This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications. We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process. Papers that are in the ARR system after May 27, 2023, either submitted after or submitted before and not withdrawn, cannot be submitted to EMNLP 2023.

EMNLP 2023, to be held in Singapore, data TBD, 2023. Fee Waiving Up to 3 instructors per tutorial can have their registration fees waived for the main conference and any subset of co-located tutorials and workshops. Diversity And Inclusion To foster a really inclusive culture in our field, we particularly encourage submissions from members of underrepresented groups in computational linguistics, i.e., researchers from any demographic or geographic minority, researchers with disabilities, among others. The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.  Tutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g., working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice, organizers may consult resources such as the BIG directory, Black in AI, {Dis}ability in AI, Indigenous AI, LatinX in AI, Masakhane, 500 Queer Scientists, and Women-in-ML\u2019s directory.

Three people are confirmed dead after two small aircraft collided mid-air in Colorado Saturday, authorities said. Multiple 911 callers reported seeing two planes collide over Boulder County shortly before 9 a.m. local time, the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said. The aircraft collided and crashed near Vance Brand Airport in Longmont at 8:50 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The collision involved a single-engine Cessna 172 and a Sonex Xenos aircraft, a type of motor glider, the National Transportation Safety Board said. First responders found two separate crash sites near Niwot Road, the sheriff's office said. Aerial footage showed that one of the aircraft had landed in trees, while the other crashed into a nearby field. Two people were on board the Cessna 172, the FAA said. The sheriff's office also said it confirmed two people were on board the plane, both of whom were found dead at the scene. The sheriff's office said at this time one person was confirmed to be in the aircraft, who was also found dead at the scene. The FAA said it is unknown how many people were on board the second aircraft. The victims have yet to be identified, the sheriff's office said. Once identified, their names will be released pending next-of-kin notification. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash.\nUpdated Monday, September 19 at 11:05 a.m. The Boulder County Coroner's Office identified the crash victims Monday morning. They are Daniel Wilmoth, 22; Samuel Fisher, 23, and Henry Butler, 69.  Updated Sunday, September 18 at 11:08 a.m.  In a press conference Saturday evening, National Transportation Safety Board lead investigator Mike Folkerts revealed more details about the fatal midair collision that occurred just before 9 a.m. on Saturday. Folkerts confirmed the three people killed in a midair collision were the only passengers onboard when the planes crashed. The names of the victims have not been released. However, Folkerts confirmed all three dead were pilots. The victims in the Cessna 172 were a flight instructor and student pilot, while the victim in the Sonex Xenos was the pilot.\u00a0 The Cessna departed from the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield Saturday morning for a training flight. The Sonex aircraft departed from the Platte Valley Airpark in Fort Lupton.\u00a0 Neither aircraft was equipped with a collision-avoidance system. Folkerts said neither of the planes were required to install that system.\u00a0 A preliminary report of the collision will be released within two weeks of the incident. Final reports could take up to 18 months before they\u2019re released. The NTSB is looking for witnesses to assist in the investigation.\n9NEWS Aviation Safety Analyst Greg Feith said that whenever there is a midair collision, there's a multifaceted investigation.\u00a0 \"You have to look again, first and foremost at each aircraft for any kind of mechanical malfunction, failure or anomalies that would cause or contributed to the accident,\" he said, adding that the other factor includes looking at the avionics of each plane, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).\u00a0 \"That uses transponder information and the transponder basically pings a signal from the airplane. It's picked up by air traffic control radar so that your plane can be identified by the number, altitude and ground speed. But the technology also lets airplanes communicate among each other. So now the same ping goes off between point or one airplane to the other,\" Feith explained.\u00a0 Besides that system, Feith believes this is more of a \"see and avoid\" type accident.\u00a0 \"That is on a beautiful day like this, it is incumbent upon each pilot flying in the airspace to clear the area visually to ensure that things like this don't happen,\" he said.\u00a0 Feith adds that the airspace around where this crash may have happened, is known to have high air traffic, especially since it's known as a \"training box.\" \"So you have a lot of airplanes operating in a band of airspace or a box of airspace.\nAt least three people died after two planes collided midair Saturday in Boulder County, Colorado, officials say.           A single-engine Cessna 172 and another aircraft \u201ccollided and crashed\u201d near Vance Brand Airport in Longmon just before 9 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Longmont is located about a half hour from Boulder.           There were two people onboard the Cessna 172, according to the FAA. The number of people onboard the second aircraft, identified by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as a Sonex Xenos, is not confirmed at this time, the FAA said.            Both passengers in the Cessna 172 died on the scene, the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. There was one confirmed occupant in the other aircraft, who was also reported deceased upon the arrival of first responders, the sheriff\u2019s office said.           When first responders arrived on the scene, they discovered two separate crash sites, according to the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office.           The first aircraft was found on the south side of Niwot Road, while the second aircraft was found on the north side.           Authorities have not yet identified the three people who died in the crash, police said.            The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash.    \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash. NTSB said that a preliminary report will be released in about 15 days. The full investigation, however, can take more than a year. Niwot Road between Highway 287 and 95th Street was closed while Mountain View Fire Rescue and BCSO investigated the crash. The public was asked to stay away from the area.\nQuestion:How many people died in the mid-air collision in Boulder County?\nAnswer:"

[and] offensive\" in a series of written notes in the Senate.[120][121] In the following days, after meetings between parties' leader, tensions loosened and the centre-right coalition parties reached an agreement on the formation of the new cabinet.[122]  On 20 October, consultations between President Sergio Mattarella and parties officially began. On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy\u2013Us Moderates\u2013MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]\nPopulist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.           She received the mandate to form a government from Italy\u2019s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month\u2019s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy\u2019s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy\u2019s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini\u2019s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.\nThe ceremony took place after a week of tensions within Meloni\u2019s coalition after partner Berlusconi boasted about his ties with Russian President Putin. Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners\u2019 stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members. Another key department, the defence ministry, is going to Brothers of Italy\u2019s co-founder and close adviser to Meloni Guido Crosetto \u2013 a defence industry expert who was head of the Federation of Italian Aerospace Companies.\nGiorgia Meloni (Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8d\u0292ord\u0292a me\u02c8lo\u02d0ni]; born 15 January 1977) is an Italian politician who has been serving as the prime minister of Italy since 22 October 2022, the first woman to hold this position. A member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2006, she has led the Brothers of Italy (FdI) political party since 2014, and she has been the president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020.  In 1992, Meloni joined the Youth Front, the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist political party founded in 1946 by former followers of Italian fascism. She later became the national leader of Student Action, the student movement of the National Alliance (AN), a post-fascist party that became the MSI's legal successor in 1995 and moved towards national conservatism. She was a councillor of the Province of Rome from 1998 to 2002, after which she became the president of Youth Action, the youth wing of AN. In 2008, she was appointed Italian Minister of Youth in the fourth Berlusconi government, a role which she held until 2011. In 2012, she co-founded FdI, a legal successor to AN, and became its president in 2014.\nThe possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.\nQuestion:Who is Italy's first female prime minister?\nAnswer:"

While Tottenham defender Ben Davies also looks to have recovered from surgery on his groin in time for the crunch clash.\nLast updated on 19 September 202219 September 2022.From the section Wales Wales have called up teenage Birmingham City midfielder Jordan James for their Nations League games against Belgium and Poland on 22 and 25 September after injury ruled out Joe Allen. Uncapped James, 18, has played for England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0 Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty. \"He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,\" Conte told Sky Sports.  \"It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the international break because, with the national team, he is not available.  \"But I think after the international break, he will be available for us.\" Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.\nBut he has quickly established himself as one of Swansea's key players having returned to the club after leaving Stoke City at the end of last season. Davies' absence and the loss of Allen are further blows to Wales manager Page, who is already planning to be without forward Gareth Bale to face Belgium. Wales are also without injured midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson, plus goalkeeper Adam Davies. Wales' World Cup campaign begins against the USA on 21 November. James has made 10 appearances for Birmingham this season and has previously represented Wales at Under 18 level. Born in Hereford, he qualifies for Wales via his father, former Newport County defender Tony. who also played for Hereford. Wales sit bottom of League A Group 4 with one draw from four games, with results not helped by Page having to field largely second-string sides in two of those games as he prepared for what would turn out to be a historic World Cup play-off victory over Ukraine. But that leaves Wales needing at least one win from these two fixtures if they are to remain in the top tier of the Nations League.

The finals featured the first-seeded Las Vegas Aces facing off against the third-seeded Connecticut Sun.[1] The Aces defeated the Sun in 4 games, winning their first WNBA Championship. This was Las Vegas's third time making the finals, and the second time since moving to Vegas. They previously competed in the Finals in 2008 and 2020.

The Golden Globes returned to NBC after the 2022 broadcast was pulled amid controversy. The 2023 awards show was held at the Beverly Hilton in California on Tuesday, January 10, hosted by comedian Jerrod Carmichael. Nominations were revealed in December 2022, three months after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) confirmed that the Golden Globes would air on TV once again for its milestone 80th ceremony. \u201cWe are thrilled to announce the return of the Golden Globe Awards on NBC and to hosting the \u2018Party of the Year\u2019 for audiences around the world who have been waiting for its return,\u201d HFPA president Helen Hoehne noted in a September 2022 statement, calling the awards a \u201cmust-see\u201d event. \u201cThe HFPA remains committed to important changes and supporting programs which prioritize diversity, inclusion, and transparency. See you on January 10!\u201d Trophies were handed out to the best and brightest stars of film and TV in January 2022, but the celebration wasn\u2019t televised.\nPlanning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization\u2019s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions\u2019s CEO Jay Penske said: \u201cAs stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.\u201d The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix\u2019s \u00a0YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a\u00a0Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of \u201cself-dealing\u201d and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of\u00a0Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like\u00a0I May Destroy You were snubbed.\nCreate a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive show news, updates, and more! Let awards season begin!\u00a0 NBC will be hosting the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards in 2023. The network has been hosting the award ceremony since 1996, which recognizes the best and brightest in film and television, as selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.  \u201cWe recognize the HFPA\u2019s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th anniversary in January 2023,\u201d Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming\u2019s Chairman of Entertainment Networks, said in a statement.\u00a0 Here's what to know about the\u00a02023 Golden Globes: Tuesday, January 10, 2023.\nStepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.  The show was pushed out of the mainstream awards cycle last year after a Los Angeles Times investigation uncovered questionable self-dealing, ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among members of its parent organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.   Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d \u201cFabelmans,\u201d \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d and \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin.\u201d   The 80th Golden Globe Awards \u2014 which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season \u2014 will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network\u2019s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes\u2019 return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show\u2019s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them \u2014 and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios \u2014 including Netflix and WarnerMedia \u2014 cut ties after The Times\u2019 investigation.\nQuestion:When did the Golden Globe Awards 2023 take place?\nAnswer:"

Jump to a Section  The Google Pixel Watch features a sleek design with limitless customizations to reflect your style. It also integrates the best of Google and Fitbit, delivering accurate health monitoring and forming a powerful activity companion.   The Google Pixel Watch was released on October 13, 2022, following a pre-order phrase that began October 6. View the Google Pixel Watch on the Google Store.   The Google Pixel Watch costs $349.99 for the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi model. For 4G LTE support, the price jumps to $399.99.   A USB-C magnetic charging case and additional watch band comes with the purchase.  Google  The Pixel Watch comes in two models\u2014Wi-Fi and LTE\u2014but only one size: 41mm.\n17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\n27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294\u00a0mAh battery and 2\u00a0GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\nSimply reading \u201cPixel Watch 2\u201d in an official-looking font, it\u2019s unclear if it was taken from an internal Google source, or is simply a mock-up. The tweet was posted on the 9th of May, potentially hinting at an I/O reveal (the keynote took place the next day) but one never came. Let\u2019s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn\u2019t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it\u2019ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it\u2019s a safe bet that Google will follow suit. That means we can expect the Pixel Watch 2 to arrive in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, barring any delays.  Pricing is more of an unknown. You could pick up a Pixel Watch for \u00a3339/$350 at launch, but prices quickly dropped and now you can get one for \u00a3300/$300 with a bit of shopping around. Would a successor land at a more modest price to drum up interest? And while Google managed to match the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro\u2018s prices to their predecessors, the Pixel 7a arrived with a \u00a350/$50 increase over the outgoing Pixel 6a.\nThe Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nQuestion:What is the release date of the Pixel Watch?\nAnswer:"

The Super Bowl halftime show, before Michael Jackson, was an endless wasteland of college marching bands and maddening flag-spinning tributes, from salutes to Hollywood (twice), to Motown, to the Big Band Era, to the Caribbean, to Duke Ellington.

Here is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes: 2023: Rihanna 2022:\u00a0Eminem, Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J.\nThe Super Bowl LVII halftime show, officially known as the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show, was the halftime entertainment of Super Bowl LVII, which took place on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It featured Barbadian singer Rihanna as the headline performer. It was televised nationally in the U.S. by Fox, Fox Deportes, and the Fox Sports and NFL apps, and was the first Super Bowl halftime show to be sponsored by Apple Music.[1][2] It is currently the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show of all time, reaching over 121 million concurrent viewers.   In October 2019, Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed to Vogue that she had turned down an offer from the National Football League (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. In 2016, Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States. He later filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners in November 2017, accusing them of colluding to keep him out of the league. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL.[3]\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Super Bowl LVII was exciting and come down to the very end as the Kansas City Chiefs hoisted the Lombardi Trophy.

Rihanna had not performed in years and had been quiet as far as her music scene goes,\u00a0so this was a highly anticipated show. Last year, five performers took the stage for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles, California. Eminem, Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige performed halfway through the Rams win over the Bengals.\u00a0 For the artists who play the halftime show at the Super Bowl, they're entertaining an audience that is exponentially bigger than any they've ever encountered. It was not always like that however.\u00a0 So, what were the shows like before they were must-see television?

No, no you do not.\nSports rights have long been the province of traditional media companies like Fox, Disney, Paramount Global and NBCUniversal, but technology companies like Apple and Amazon have made a bigger play for those rights as they seek to bring in consumers to their broadband subscription-video services. Amazon, for its part, is now a major NFL partner thanks to its control of rights to \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d  \tEarlier this year, the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show assembled a star-studded crew of artists including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

The 67-year-old Abe, who was Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his heart had stopped.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech on July 8 outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. Yamagami then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation prosecutors said showed he's fit to stand trial.   Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them he killed Abe, one of Japan's most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe's apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.  One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.\nBy\u00a0         Shauneen Miranda                        Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's assassination resulted from an extremely rare act of gun violence in the country.

Abe was shot from behind in the western city of Nara while speaking at a campaign event ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. Police arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, at the scene. Yamagami, an unemployed former sailor in Japan's maritime armed forces, confessed to the assassination in which he used a handmade firearm, according to police.   Police said Yamagami told them that he went to Okayama, another western city, where Abe was giving another campaign speech the day before the shooting, according to Kyodo News, which cited \"investigative sources.\" Yamagami denied any political motivations for the assassination, according to police.

TOKYO \u2014 Japan held a rare state funeral for its longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Tuesday, despite widespread public opposition to the event. Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun. The government estimates that 23,000 mourners lined up to lay flowers at tables in front of pictures of Abe outside the hall. In a sign of the divisions surrounding the commemoration, thousands of others took to the streets in protest. Just down the street from the Budokan, protesters opposed to the state funeral tussled with Abe supporters and police.  Critics objected to the use of $11.\nThe state funeral of Shinzo Abe, former prime minister of Japan and serving member of the House of Representatives who was assassinated on 8 July 2022, was attended by roughly 3,600 people within Japan alone and by around 700 international attendees.[1] The funeral was held on 27 September 2022 at the Nippon Budokan venue in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Out of the foreign attendees, 49 top-level foreign leaders and 218 foreign delegates, including 101 ambassadors and representatives based in Japan, were present at the state funeral.[2]\n27, 2022 for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan. (Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) \u2014 A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation\u2019s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party\u2019s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party\u2019s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan\u2019s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.\nQuestion:when was the State funeral of Shinzo Abe\nAnswer:"

With its razor-sharp script, schooldays nostalgia and genius characters, it\u2019s certainly a series to binge. After the first two seasons were a huge success, find out everything we know so far about the show's return in 2022 for season 3, including the release date, cast, trailer and more. Watch the latest shows and sport from Sky with a NOW Membership, Netflix, and Discovery+ all in one place. Derry Girls season 3 starts on Tuesday, April 12th, 2022 on Channel 4. Catch up on All 4. New episodes are released weekly. Season 3 releases new episodes every Tuesday at 9.15pm on Channel 4. The final season will have six episodes. The Derry Girls season 3 finale will air on Tuesday 17 May at 9.15pm on Channel 4. It's been confirmed that a special one-off episode will will air in the same week as the finale, although Channel 4 hasn't announced a specific release date for it yet.\nIt's the beginning of the end. Fans of Derry Girls\u00a0now have an official date for when the third and final season of the comedy will premiere on Netflix. Season three, which already premiered in April 2022 in the UK, is set to have its international premiere on the streamer in October. Netflix confirmed the news, writing on Twitter Aug. 31, \"It's going to be so hard to say goodbye...The final season of our beloved Derry Girls arrives October 7 on Netflix (outside The UK & Ireland).\" This has us just about ready to blast The Cranberries and wallow in our rooms. However, the ending of the Derry Girls doesn't come as a surprise to fans, as the show's creator Lisa McGee announced the show's final season back in September. \"It was always the plan to say goodbye after three series,\" the screenwriter explained at the time. She later called Derry Girls \"a love letter to the place I come from and the people who shaped me.\" Derry Girls stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Louisa Harland and Dylan Llewellyn as a group of Irish teens growing up in Northern Ireland in the \u201890s. Coughlan is now one of the stars of Bridgerton, and is set to step into the leading lady spot for season three.\nThe girls are back for one last adventure.  The third and final season of Derry Girls has an American release date. TVLine reports that the series, which stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Louisa Harland and Dylan Llewellyn, will be available on the streaming platform on October 7. Netflix's official Twitter posted a tweet stating it was hard to say goodbye to the show, saying the \"final season of our beloved Derry Girls arrives October 7 on Netflix (outside The UK & Ireland).\" Last fall, creator and writer Lisa McGee confirmed on Twitter the third season would be the last, and that it was always the plan to have the show end after three seasons. \"Derry Girls is a coming of age story...a love letter to the place I come from and the people who shaped me,\" McGee said, also commenting it was an honor to write the show, and she was proud of what it had accomplished and achieved. The show premiered in the UK and Ireland in January 2018 and on Netflix in December 2018. The first season garnered praise among critics and fans, holding a 100% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the second season holding a 97% Certified Fresh rating.\nIt's been over three years since fans of the hilarious sitcom Derry Girls saw Erin (played by Saoirse-Monica Jackson), Orla (Louisa Harland), Clare (Nicola Coughlan), Michelle (Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), and James (Dylan Llewellyn) get up to some serious mischief. Thankfully, Derry Girls Season 3 is almost here. However, the long-anticipated wait for Season 3 is bittersweet as the latest series marks the end of the Derry Girls story. Lucky fans in the U.K. and Ireland will have access to the new series before the rest of the world, with the third and final season premiering on Tuesday, April 12 at 9.15 p.m. on Channel 4 and episodes airing every Tuesday thereafter. So, when exactly will Season 3 of Derry Girls land on Netflix? Newsweek has everything you need to know. Just like the first two seasons of Derry Girls, Season 3 will be coming to Netflix for fans to enjoy. Unfortunately, fans in the U.S. will be waiting a little longer for the final season to drop. The good news is, unlike viewers in the U.K., who will have to wait for every Tuesday at 9.15 p.m. for episodes to drop, all six episodes will be available in one go for fans to binge-watch.\nQuestion:When is the premiere date of Derry Girls Season 3?\nAnswer:"

The move comes two weeks after the announcement that previous CEO Charlie Collier was leaving to head up Roku\u2019s media business.    \t\u201cSince the formation of Fox Entertainment, Rob has been an integral part of the leadership team responsible for delivering on its long-term strategy of creating an independent media company built on broadcast, developing an owned content portfolio and maintaining a disciplined in-house infrastructure,\u201d Fox Corp. executive chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. \u201cGiven Rob\u2019s sharp creative instincts and proven operational acumen, he is well-suited to lead Fox Entertainment in what promises to be an exciting next chapter in its rich history.\u201d  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t             \t \tTV \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tAlex Rodriguez Closes in on Contract Extension With Fox Sports (Exclusive)\t\t \t\t\t               \t \tTV \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tFox Rolls Out Unscripted-Reliant Fall Schedule\nNew York, NY and Los Angeles, CA\u00a0\u2013 October 6, 2022 \u2013 Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Fox Corporation (Nasdaq: FOXA, FOX), today announced that Rob Wade has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of FOX Entertainment, effective immediately. Wade most recently served as President, Alternative Entertainment and Specials of FOX Entertainment. In this role, Wade and his team will guide one of the world\u2019s most recognizable media brands and content producers with FOX broadcast network as its centerpiece. FOX Entertainment includes an expanding portfolio of owned content studios, including award-winning animation house Bento Box Entertainment, TMZ, MarVista Entertainment and Studio Ramsay Global. FOX Entertainment also includes the in-house unscripted studio FOX Alternative Entertainment, scripted content creator FOX Entertainment Studios, Blockchain Creative Labs, and the worldwide content sales unit FOX Entertainment Global. \u201cSince the formation of FOX Entertainment, Rob has been an integral part of the leadership team responsible for delivering on its long-term strategy of creating an independent media company built on broadcast, developing an owned content portfolio and maintaining a disciplined in-house infrastructure,\u201d said Murdoch. \u201cGiven Rob\u2019s sharp creative instincts and proven operational acumen, he is well-suited to lead FOX Entertainment in what promises to be an exciting next chapter in its rich history.\nPrevious gigs also include serving as EP on \u201cThe X Factor\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d as well as head of TV at Syco Entertainment North America.  \tIn taking the key Fox Entertainment chairman job, Wade follows in the footsteps of other alternative execs who have ultimately run a network, including former NBC Entertainment chairman Paul Telegdy (who coincidentally also hails from the UK, like Wade).  \tWade\u2019s appointment to the top Fox gig comes as Collier exited the network last month to join Roku Media as president. There, Collier will now oversee advertising sales and content for Roku\u2019s owned-and-operated channels featured on the streaming platform that hosts the fast-growing number of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels as well as serving as a key funnel for Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+ and other subscription streamers.  \tHere\u2019s a memo Wade sent to staffers on Thursday:  Dear Team,It is truly humbling and a great honor to be the new CEO of Fox Entertainment. I want to say how incredibly excited I am for the privilege to lead this outstanding team and our company. I have been at FOX for five and half years in my current role and have had the chance to get to know most of you and have a front row seat to your fantastic work. I have also witnessed the kindness and generosity you all show that is at the heart of our organization.\nQuestion:Who is the new CEO of Fox Entertainment?\nAnswer:"

Before the hiatus, Mercedes had dominated the Japanese GP of late, winning the last six races in a row. Lewis Hamilton is a five-time winner at the Suzuka Circuit and will be seeking a sixth victory on Sunday to tie Michael Schumacher's record for the most Japan GP wins. The race will start at 1 a.m. ET on Sunday. Hamilton and Mercedes have struggled this season but he's listed at 10-1 in the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix odds from Caesars Sportsbook in large part because of his track record. However, Red Bull's Max Verstappen is the -190 favorite (bet $190 to win $100) as the runaway favorite to win his second drivers' championship and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc is second on the F1 Japan odds board at 15-4.

Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio P\u00e9rez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.  The event was held across the weekend of the 7\u20139 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since 2019, with the 2020 and 2021 races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Valtteri Bottas entered as the defending race winner.\nQuestion:Who won the Japanese Grand Prix 2022?\nAnswer:"

Shahi will be seen as Adrianna Tomaz, aka Isis, in the widely anticipated DC film Black Adam. One of the film's most fascinating aspects is Black Adam's relationship with Adrianna Tomaz. Regarding her role in the film, Sarah Shahi said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Adrianna Tomaz has a brother named Karim, played by actor Mohammed Amer. Not many other plot details are known at this point, but it'll be interesting to see how Adrianna Tomaz's role as Black Adam's love interest pans out in the film. Black Adam chronicles the eventful story of the titular character who returns to the modern world after centuries of imprisonment and teams up with the Justice Society of America (JSA). Here's the official synopsis of the movie, as per DC: The film's initial reactions have been mostly positive, with praise majorly directed towards the thrilling action sequences and ambitious plot. Dwayne Johnson has received high praise from fans for his performance in the lead role. Black Adam will drop in theaters on Friday, October 21, 2022.\nWhile specific plot details for Black Adam are currently unknown, Shahi's Adrianna Tomaz will join a host of heroes and villains which are all being introduced for the first time to the silver screen. Along with Adrianna, the movie will also feature the big screen debut of Justice Society of America, or JSA. The iconic superhero team will no doubt clash with Johnson's superpowered champion, with the Justice Society of America set to be made up of Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate. Shahi's role in proceedings was not the only Black Adam mystery, with Marwan Kenzari, Bodhi Sabongui, and James Cusati-Moyer all cast in currently unknown roles. Black Adam finally going into production marks another achievement for Dwayne Johnson, with the actor and Hollywood superstar having been signed on to play the role for over a decade. \"Black Adam has been with me for over ten years now. That gives you an idea of how passionate I am about this project,\" Johnson said last year of his commitment to the project. \"How passionate our Seven Bucks is about this project. Warner Bros., New Line Cinemas, DC, they have been so incredibly supportive over the years,\" Johnson continued. \"In 2008 was when we first started talking about this. So, it has required patience by all of us as partners.\nSarah Shahi has seemingly confirmed the long-running rumor that she will play Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam. After all these years, Black Adam is now finally ready to begin filming, and star Sarah Shahi, whose role has remained relatively mysterious, may have now revealed who she is playing. Shahi recently took to social media to celebrate the start of filming on the DC outing, referring to her character as \"Adrianna,\" and thus likely confirming and ongoing rumor that she will, in fact, be playing Adrianna Tomaz. \"Today is my first day filming #blackadam. I was cast in this role a year ago. I've had ups, downs, lefts, and rights. They all led me here. Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna. Let's continue to lift each other up as we tell each other's stories. Human stories. Connecting stories. Stories we all have inside of us.\" Adrianna Tomaz was originally spun out of the 1970s TV series The Secrets of Isis, which aired alongside the original Shazam! television show. The character was later folded into DC lore, becoming known as the wife of Black Adam. A refugee who is delivered to Black Adam as a gift, the supervillain quickly develops a deep respect for Adrianna, eventually gifting her with the magical amulet of Isis, which imbues her with powers over the forces of nature.\nRelated:\u00a0Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on\u00a0Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of\u00a0Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for\u00a0Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how\u00a0Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.\nIn the upcoming Dwayne Johnson flick, Black Adam, the character of Adrianna Tomaz is played by actress Sarah Shahi. Tomaz, aka Isis, was a refugee Black Adam received as a bribe from Intergang. Tomaz plays a pivotal role in Black Adam's evolution as a character. Sarah Shahi is a noted actress who's appeared in several popular TV shows and films over the years.  Instagram Post Sarah Shahi was born on January 10, 1980, to Abbas Jahansouzshahi and Mahmonir Soroushazar. Shahi has Iranian ancestry from her paternal and maternal sides. While her father and paternal grandfather are Iranian, her maternal grandmother is Spanish. Shahi was born Aahoo Jahansouzshahi but later changed her name to Sarah Shahi. As a child, Shahi was interested in sports and participated in beauty pageants. She majored in English and Theater at the Southern Methodist University in New Mexico. Sarah Shahi met legendary American director Robert Altman early in her career and worked on his film, Dr. T & the Women. She subsequently went on to star in Dawson's Creek, Supernatural, Alias, and The L Word. In 2007, she played a minor role in HBO's iconic gangster series, The Sopranos. That same year, she landed her first lead role on television in Facing Kate, aka Fairly Legal.\nQuestion:who played Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam?\nAnswer:"

The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick\u00a0actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently\u00a0leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother,\u00a0will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.\nMartin Gero, Deborah Pratt, and Quantum Leap creator Don Bellisario are also executive producing the revival. The Quantum Leap revival will at least have a pilot episode before NBC makes decision about whether to order a new series. Are you looking forward to seeing Lee in the new Quantum Leap?

Deadline is reporting that Raymond Lee has been cast in the leading role in the new Quantum Leap pilot. Lee will portray Dr. Ben Seong, the \u201cspiritual successor\u201d of Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), the original time traveler on the series. Within the reboot/revival series, Seong is described as both \u201ca world-renowned physicist\u201d and also \u201ca man of faith.\u201d The potential show takes place 30 years after Sam disappeared into the time travel machine he created: the Quantum Leap accelerator. Seong will initially be a member of the new team, before eventually using the accelerator to go back to the past. According to to the report, \u201d Ben Seong gets stuck in the late 1980s with amnesia.\u201d But there\u2019s no mention about whether someone on his team can communicate with him in the form of a hologram, like the late Dean Stockwell\u2019s Al.

The Quantum Leap revival series will debut on NBC later this month, and the first official trailer has been released. The Quantum Leap revival follows a new team who has been assembled to restart the Quantum Leap project in the hopes of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it. Raymond Lee stars as Dr. Ben Seong, a world-renowned physicist and man of faith who finds himself stuck in the late 1980s with amnesia after using the Quantum leap technology on himself.

Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we\u2019ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It\u2019s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.\nSearching for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to buy? Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got your covered, by searching through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia\u2019s shining star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping performance metrics, it\u2019s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090 is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the 4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.\nBoth RTX 4080 configurations will be available in November, with prices starting at $1,199 and $899, respectively.  Where to Buy\r The GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs will be available as custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, Galaxy, GIGABYTE, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and Zotac. The RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (16GB) are also produced directly by NVIDIA in limited Founders Editions for fans wanting the NVIDIA in-house design. Look for the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs in gaming systems built by Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and MSI, leading system builders worldwide, and many more. About NVIDIA\r Since its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry. More information at\u00a0https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/.\nThe RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn\u2019t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you\u2019ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC\u2019d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you\u2019re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS. However, months after launch, prices for board partner GPUs are beginning to ease toward MSRP. Despite this, it\u2019s still priced lower than we initially expected, as a Vietnamese retailer listed the new GPU for over $2000. However, it\u2019s thankfully lower.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.

Yes, there is a trailer for Sweetwater, and it can be watched below: The themes of the film are striking throughout the trailer, with the opening line \"It ain't about the color of my skin\" resonating instantly. The dramatic score and intense dialogue set up a feeling of triumph through adversity, and it looks as if Sweetwater may just be one of the most feel-good movies hitting theaters this Spring. Every good biopic has a strong and often inspiring central character, and Sweetwater is no different. Born in Arkansas in October 1922, Nat Clifton, nicknamed \"Sweetwater\" because of his love for fizzy drinks, showed his true talent for basketball throughout his time in school. After serving in the US Army during World War II, Clifton made it back safely and began his career in professional basketball. As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd. In 2014, some 24 years after his death, Clifton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, perfectly summarizing his incredible career.\nFind our brews in your neck of the woods, or order some online!

The production budget was reported to be $10 million and filming was expected to begin in New York in late 2014.[11]  Production was subsequently completed by October 2022, with Pollak as Saperstein, Dreyfuss as Maurice Podoloff, Cary Elwes as Irish, Jeremy Piven as Joe Lapchick. Gary Clark Jr and Bobby Portis make cameos.[5]  Guigui and Jeff Cardoni composed the film's score.[13]  Sweetwater was released by Briarcliff Entertainment on April 14, 2023.[5] The soundtrack album was released by Candid Records on the film's opening day.[14]\nWhen New York Knicks executive Ned Irish and Knicks coach Joe Lapchick decide it is time for the Knicks to integrate, with the support of NBA President Maurice Podoloff, they come together with the other team owners of the league to make history.\" With Clifton as the subject, the film is likely to not just tackle his story, but themes of discrimination and a struggle for acceptance, with the decision to focus on this period of his life an apt one.

(See the rest of the differences between the Google Pixel Watch vs. Fitbit Sense 2.) The Pixel Watch release date was October 13, 2022, and since then we're continuing to track the best Pixel Watch deals.\u00a0Note that the Pixel Watch launched alongside the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, which would both make ideal companion devices for the company's smartwatch.\u00a0 The Google Pixel Watch is a simple-looking smartwatch, I might even call it minimalistic. It comes in just one size: 41mm. Those with larger wrists might complain about the lack of a larger option; that said, it fit me perfectly.\u00a0 The face features a rounded design with a 3D glass dome. This raised effect distracts from the display's thick bezel, but doesn't change the fact that a good chunk of the display is unusable. Perhaps my prior experience with Samsung watches is to blame? I can't help but think it's a missed opportunity to incorporate in digital rotating bezel in that space.\u00a0  It seems like no mistake that the Pixel Watch is a \"dark mode\" device. The interface and all of Google's watch faces have black backgrounds to further conceal the bezel.\n27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294\u00a0mAh battery and 2\u00a0GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\nTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

Julian Chokkattu nearly a decade after Google launched its Android Wear smartwatch platform\u2014now called Wear\u2014a Google-made watch is finally here. It's called the Pixel Watch. The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.\u00a0 There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8. Speaking of Apple, these Pixel Watches lack any sort of iPhone compatibility. Google's taking a page from Apple and limiting the Pixel Watch for use with Android phones only.

The Pixel Watch comes in black, silver, or gold.\nThe Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nQuestion:When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?\nAnswer:"

And Hidden Heroes started doing it 10 years ago, and it is the key operative motor.\u201d  Tom Hanks Hanks is best known as an actor and director, creating feel-good masterpieces like Big, Toy Story, and That Thing You Do, but also for creating historical epics that chart the stories of our men and women at war, like Saving Private Ryan or the HBO series \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201d Maybe this fascination with the Greatest Generation is what led to his work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and supporting military caregivers as the chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign.

Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left to lead the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue lives a block from the park. \u201cWith three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,\u201d said Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance\u2019s board on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s our backyard and front yard.\u201d The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration projects. Last year, the park unveiled the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a $74 million project that includes two skating rinks; the southeast corner of the park was also restored and redesigned. Like the leaders of several major park conservancies, Ms. Donoghue, 49, will serve as both the alliance\u2019s president and the park\u2019s official administrator for the parks department.\nOn February 4, Mayor Eric Adams announced that Prospect Park\u2026 October 17, 2022 Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks announced today that longtime New York City public servant Morgan Monaco will become the new President of the Alliance, the non-profit that operates the park in partnership with the City, and also the Prospect Park Administrator, a public appointment by NYC Parks.  Monaco, whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most especially park users to help shape her vision for the park\u2019s future. Coming out of the pandemic and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization\u2019s capacity in order to keep pace with the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.\nShe hopes to continue to build upon the Alliance\u2019s already extensive network of partners to bring more programs that are focused on health, wellness and other services that help residents thrive. \u201cOn behalf of the Alliance\u2019s Board of Directors, I am thrilled to welcome Morgan Monaco as the new President of Prospect Park Alliance,\u201d said Iris Weinshall, Chair of the Prospect Park Alliance Board of Directors. \u201cMorgan\u2019s extensive parks and social service experience working at community-based nonprofits and city agencies has equipped her with exactly the right knowledge and expertise to successfully lead one of the city\u2019s most cherished green spaces. I am excited to work with Morgan as her vision for Brooklyn\u2019s Backyard comes to life.\u201d \u201cProspect Park Alliance has made a tremendous choice in its selection of Morgan Monaco as president.

I am so excited to welcome Morgan into the role of President, and look forward to working closely with her to guarantee the Park continues to be a place all New Yorkers can enjoy.\u201d \u201cProspect Park is a gem in Brooklyn, and our communities deserve a leader to take the helm of Prospect Park Alliance with the passion and effort that the job requires,\u201d said Council Member Rita Joseph. \u201cMorgan Monaco delivers on those requirements and then some.

It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Riot Games' publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversees the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the League of Legends universe.  Riot Games operates 12 international League of Legends esports leagues, the League of Legends World Championship and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 20 offices worldwide as of 2023, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues. Riot has faced allegations and lawsuits claiming a toxic workplace culture, including gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The company was criticized for its use of forced arbitration in response to these allegations.  Riot Games' founders Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill became friends while roommates at the University of Southern California, where the two studied business.[3] Beck and Merrill believed too many video game developers diverted their focus from game to game too often, distinguishing Defense of the Ancients as an indication that games could be supported and monetized long-term.\nBy  Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture.

The series was released worldwide in November 2021 on Netflix, and by parent company Tencent in China, and received a favorable critical reception.[39][40] In March 2022, Riot Games announced that it had invested in Fortiche and, as a result, its chief content officer Brian Wright and director of corporate development Brendan Mulligan were joining Fortiche's board of directors.[41] That same month, Riot also hired executives from Netflix, Paramount, and HBO Max to head development of film, TV, and music endeavors built around the company's intellectual property.[42]  In October 2022, Riot acquired Wargaming Sydney\u2014a subsidiary of Cyprus-based Wargaming that had originally developed the MMO middleware BigWorld\u2014for an undisclosed amount, and renamed it Riot Sydney.

This role will enable me to support our next phase of growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo.

Below, you can read the full memo from former Yahoo boss Guru Gowrappan announcing the change. Gowrappan said he will become an advisor to Yahoo. The CEO swap comes just eight days after Apollo took control over Yahoo. CNBC reported last month that Gowrappan was uncertain about his future as private equity firm Apollo closed its transaction of Yahoo, previously known as Verizon Media, on Sept. 1.   Tinder announced on Friday that it has hired Renate Nyborg as CEO of the dating site.\n33][34] Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004 partly using technology from its $280 million acquisition of Inktomi in 2002.[35] In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. In 2008, the company laid off hundreds of people as it struggled from competition.[36]  In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion.[37][38] Yahoo rejected the bid, claiming that it \"substantially undervalues\" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Although Microsoft increased its bid to $47 billion, Yahoo insisted on another 10%+ increase to the offer and Microsoft cancelled the offer in May 2008.[39][40][41][42]  Carol Bartz, who had no previous experience in Internet advertising, replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[43][44] In September 2011, after failing to meet targets, she was fired by chairman Roy J. Bostock; CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.[45][46]  In April 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, several key executives resigned, including chief product officer Blake Irving.\nYahoo\u2019s CEO sees a consumer giant and possible spinoffs of some of the site\u2019s biggest brands Jim Lanzone has never been afraid of a solid turnaround story. Yet the former chief of Tinder, CBS Interactive, and Ask Jeeves views Yahoo as less of a company in need of revamping than one never been properly vetted for its upside. This is why Lanzone stepped into the CEO spot in 2021, taking over the nearly 30-year-old internet legend. \u201cI do think the brand has a huge strength,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the biggest opportunity for the brand is ahead with the work we can do here.\u201d Gone is the famous yodel that played on Yahoo\u2019s commercial in the early days of the internet. Left is a brand with what Lanzone calls a \u201cmodern vintage feel,\u201d and a fanbase rooting for its success. That\u2019s not going to be hard to find, with more revenue and profit than Twitter, and a platform used by one billion people every month, he says. What does that future look like? Lanzone sees multiple opportunities \u2014 even possible spinoffs of some of Yahoo\u2019s inside brands including Yahoo Finance and its email service, which he notes filters 28 percent of all global emails.

The Verge is a vox media network \u00a9 2023 Vox Media, LLC.\nSubscribers of YouTube Premium\u2019s Family Plan will have to pay an additional $5 for their subscription after the video-streaming platform upgraded the monthly fee by 28% to $22.99. YouTube made the announcement in an email to subscribers of the family tier in the US. The change has taken effect immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers were given a 30-day notice. The email to subscribers read: We created YouTube Premium to provide an uninterrupted YouTube experience, so you can get closer to the videos, creators, and music artists that you love. To continue delivering great service and features, we will be increasing your Premium family plan price from $17.99/month to $22.99/month. This change will take place on your next billing cycle starting on or after November 21, 2022.

Reports say similar price changes are being rolled out in other markets like Canada where prices were increased to CAD $22.99 ($16.82) from CAD $17.99, and in the UK where prices were hiked to \u00a319.99 ($22.64) per month from \u00a317.99. With YouTube Premium, subscribers are able to watch videos on YouTube without ads and download videos and playlists on their mobile device to watch offline.\nIf you subscribe to a YouTube Premium family plan, you may want to check your email: Google is notifying users that the monthly cost of the service will be going up by $5 a month. Starting in November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium \u2014 though there seems to be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to their status as a \"long-standing and valued member.\" With the new price structure, the family plan is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone screen off. At least you still don't need to subscribe to Premium to watch videos in 4K.\nBy  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds.

After years of anticipation and no concrete information since September 2021, fans are desperate to get their hands on this sequel. Sony finally saw fit to shed some more light on the project in a recent blog post. The story seems to pick up shortly after its predecessor leaves off, with Kratos and Atreus asking all the same questions fans have been wondering about since that cliffhanger finale.

The announcement was made on the PlayStation blog along with a snazzy new trailer. As happy as many people are to see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the developers at Sony Santa Monica faced.

But have you paid the price and started playing yet? In our God of War Ragnar\u00f6k review, we called it \"the most ambitious God of War game to date\". We said: \"We'd argue that it pulls off all of those ambitions to deliver a story that will stick with fans for a long time, as well as gameplay that will properly challenge you in the moment.\" And our review wasn't even the most glowing one around! So, how much is God of War Ragnar\u00f6k and what else do you need to know about this exciting new title from Sony Santa Monica? Behold, all the details you seek are below! Or if you want to jump straight over to Amazon to order a PS5 bundle, we won't stop you. The God of War Ragnar\u00f6k release date is Wednesday 9th November 2022, the developers have confirmed. You can order your copy from the likes of GAME. This winter release date was revealed on the same day as the 'Father and Son' CGI trailer, which you can take a look at below! In the UK and everywhere else, the God of War Ragnar\u00f6k release time was midnight Wednesday 9th November 2022.\nHere's the release date for God of War Ragnarok. God of War Ragnarok is official \u2013 for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony\u2019s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War\u2026 so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that\u2019s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

Truss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.           She pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a \u201cbold plan\u201d to cut taxes and build economic growth, and \u201cdeliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people\u2019s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.\u201d           Monday\u2019s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.           Once Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.     15 and counting: The Queen prepares to appoint her newest PM         Truss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain\u2019s third female premier.\n\u201cThe whole list of tax cuts and ideas that frankly, according to Sunak and others, belongs to Disneyland because none of it was going to be really possible without crashing the economy more,\u201d he said. Sunak\u2019s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. \u201cThis decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,\u201d Mordaunt said in a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced. \u201cRishi has my full support.\u201d Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the UK\u2019s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK\u2019s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food. He will also inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the fortunes of several former Conservative leaders.\nWhile there were rumours about a Johnson comeback over the weekend, he pulled out of the contest on Sunday. He had said that he had secured the backing of 102 legislators and could have been \u201cback in Downing Street\u201d but he had failed to persuade either Sunak or Mordaunt to come together and back him \u201cin the national interest\u201d. \u201cI believe I have much to offer, but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time,\u201d Johnson said. The Tories retain a majority in parliament, meaning that as their leader, Sunak will be named prime minister by King Charles III. Economists have questioned whether Sunak can tackle the country\u2019s finances while holding the party\u2019s multiple warring factions together. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt \u2013 the fourth person in that role in four months \u2013 is due to present a budget on October 31 to plug a black hole in the public finances, which is expected to have ballooned to up to 40 billion pounds ($45.2bn). Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,\u201d Deane told Al Jazeera. \u201c[Sunak] didn\u2019t have a direct electoral mandate,\u201d Deane said. \u201c\u2026 One of the things he is going to have to do \u2026 is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.\nWe use some essential cookies to make this website work.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.\nRishi Sunak (/\u02c8r\u026a\u0283i \u02c8su\u02d0n\u00e6k/ (listen) RISH-ee SOO-nak;[1][2] born 12 May 1980) is a British politician who has served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since 2022. He is the first British Asian prime minister. He previously held two cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.  Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.  Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.\nQuestion:when did rishi sunak became prime minister of uk?\nAnswer:"

The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.\nJump to        With a vast library of TV shows, movies, and original programming, most people would agree that Netflix is an essential part of the entertainment landscape and easily one of the best streaming services you can sign up for. Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September \u2014 an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month. It will cost more to add another user to a subscription plan.\nNetflix\u2019s new ad tier is set to launch in the U.S. at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, introducing commercials to the service for the first time in its 15-year history. Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix\u2019s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix \u201cwill just have a pre-roll\u201d of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to \u201cpreserve that cinematic model.\u201d He added that movies that have \u201cbeen on the service for a while\u201d will have a more \u201ctraditional\u201d mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads. There are a few other additional drawbacks to the ad tier.\nWhen you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. What was once unthinkable finally happened: Netflix rolled out a cheaper streaming plan that includes ads. Netflix initially said that its ad-supported plan wouldn\u2019t arrive until 2023, but the \u201cBasic with Ads\u201d tier\u2013eventually renamed \u201cStandard with Ads\u201d\u2013went live in the fall of 2022, much sooner than expected. So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what\u2019s included? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Updated on July 19, 2023 with details on how \u201cBasic with Ads\u201d is now called \u201cStandard with Ads\u201d following the elimination of the ad-free \u201cBasic\u201d plan. Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, or $8.50 a month less than Netflix\u2019s least expensive ad-free plan. For some context, Paramount+ and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported, versus the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus) each cost $4.99 a month, while ad-supported Hulu costs $6/month. Meanwhile, HBO Max with ads goes for $10 a month, while Disney+ will charge $8 a month for its upcoming \u201cwith ads\u201d plan. As it stands, Netflix\u2019s cheapest ad-free plan, Standard, currently costs $15.49 a month for a single stream.

Reviews ethics statement      The ad-supported tier launched in November 2022.    Netflix said\u00a0Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called\u00a0Standard with ads\u00a0(formerly it was\u00a0Basic with ads). Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023.\u00a0  \"More than a quarter of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available,\" Greg Peters, Netflix's co-CEO, said in a news release. \"Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads plans.\"  Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans from other streaming services, like\u00a0Disney Plus\u00a0and\u00a0HBO Max\u00a0(soon to be called just Max). These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs\u00a0$7 a month.  Netflix said Wednesday that its ad-supported plan has almost 5 million global monthly active users, which is a different measure than subscribers, since multiple people in a household can use one Netflix account.\nQuestion:How much does the Netflix Basic with Ads subscription cost?\nAnswer:"

Given everything that's been happening in the royal family in the last few years\u2014including Queen Elizabeth's death in September, Harry and Meghan stepping back from their royal roles, and the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew\u2014fans of The Crown have been anticipating a season set in the modern day. Though the series likely won't make it all the way to 2022, the critically acclaimed show will have a few more chapters. Season 5 of the critically acclaimed series premiered in full on Netflix in November 2022, and is now nominated for four Golden Globes, including a nomination for Best Drama Series, as well as Imelda Staunton for Best Television Actress in a Drama Series, Elizabeth Debicki for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, and Jonathan Pryce for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series.  Staunton's nomination, in particular, has fans excited\u2014if she wins, all three of the actresses who have helmed the show in the role of Queen Elizabeth II will have garnered the Best Actress Golden Globe. Watch The Crown In October 2022, Netflix finally dropped the first trailer for The Crown season 5.\nThis won't be the last season of the hit Netflix show.  The Crown will last much longer than we previously thought. Despite earlier announcements saying the show's fifth season would be its last, Netflix has confirmed that the series will continue past Season 5. The biggest issue, however, is that because of coronavirus-related delays, fans will have to wait longer than usual for it to return.  But even with the postponements, Netflix has already begun announcing members of the new royal cast. (Like Claire Foy and Matt Smith of Seasons 1 and 2, Olivia Colman and co. will be replaced by new actors for Seasons 5 and 6 to reflect the passage of time.) Here's what we know about the next installment of The Crown, who will be in it, and when to expect it. Netflix has confirmed that The Crown season 5 will release this November, releasing the season's first teaser as part of their annual fan event, Tudum. The brief clip focuses on Prince Charles (Dominic West) and Princess Diana's (Elizabeth Debicki) separation in 1992, with voiceovers discussing the global response to the news as the royals prepare for a television interview. The first teaser for \u2018THE CROWN\u2019 Season 5 has been released.The series releases on November 9 on Netflix. pic.twitter.\n/vQrGU9pCRy The official poster for season 5 also has Diana and Charles in the forefront, hinting at the season's focus on their marriage with the logline, \"A house divided.\" While the couple stand at the edges of the frame, out of focus, Queen Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton) stands firm in full focus, as the center of the family. Netflix previously released a dispatch from the set of The Crown in September 2021, along with a tentative premiere month. In the clip from the streamer's fan event, Tudum, Imelda Staunton introduces herself as the show's new Queen Elizabeth II, while paying tribute to previous queens Olivia Colman and Claire Foy. \"On behalf of the cast and crew, we look forward to bringing you the next season of The Crown in November 2022,\" she says. We now also have the official trailer for the season. Soundtracked by a moody rendition of The Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony,\" the clip begins with a brief mention of the 1992 Windsor Castle Fire, before it focuses on the conflict raging within the family, as Princess Diana separates from Charles and The Firm attempts to keep her from speaking out.

It was the first season of the series to be released following both the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 9 April 2021 and the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022.  Imelda Staunton stars as Elizabeth, along with main cast members Jonathan Pryce, Lesley Manville, Jonny Lee Miller, Dominic West and Elizabeth Debicki. All cast members are new to the series; this season marked The Crown's final wholesale recasting, following the ensembles led by Claire Foy (seasons one and two) and Olivia Colman (seasons three and four).  The Crown traces the reign of Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 through to the early 21st century.[3]  The fifth season covers the time period between 1991 and 1997, and is set during the premiership of John Major.[4] Events depicted include Elizabeth's annus horribilis in 1992, Diana's Panorama interview, the separation and divorce of Prince Charles and Diana, Elizabeth's state visit to Russia, use of Prince Philip's DNA to identify the remains of the Romanov family, the decommissioning of Britannia, the handover of Hong Kong, and Major's departure from office and the beginning of Tony Blair's premiership.\nQuestion:When does season 5 of The Crown premiere?\nAnswer:"

Intended as a six-part limited series, The White Lotus premiered on July 11, 2021, to critical acclaim and high ratings. The show's success led to HBO renewing it as an anthology series; a second season premiered on October 30, 2022.[8] In November 2022, the series was renewed for a third season.[9] While no official announcement has been made, Variety reports that the third season will be filmed in Thailand,[10] and that Natasha Rothwell will reprise her role as Belinda from the first season.[11]  The series received a positive critical response.

While season one was filmed exclusively in the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, due to pandemic-related restrictions, for the second season they\u2019ve branched out from the dreamy environs of the hotel to take in some of Sicily\u2019s most beautiful towns and coastal spots, leaving one question on everyone\u2019s lips: just where was The White Lotus filmed? Here\u2019s our guide to all the key filming locations in The White Lotus season 2.\u00a0 As with the first season, most of the show is centred around the antics of the monied guests staying at an uber luxurious resort \u2013 in the first season that was the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, and for the second season the team chose another Four Seasons resort: the grand San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina. Situated high on the rocks, it offers up splendid views over the Ionian Sea, Mount Etna and an ancient amphitheatre.\nWhile The White Lotus was originally intended to be a standalone miniseries, the overwhelmingly positive reception and acclaim inspired White to utilize the anthology format to create another installment. Amidst the buzz around Season 2, HBO confirmed that the series had been renewed for another season. There haven\u2019t been any details about returning cast members, but based on the Season 2 finale, we can guess that Tanya won\u2019t be among them. While filming has not yet begun, White has teased that he\u2019s interested in exploring \"death and Eastern religion and spirituality.\" Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction. The first two seasons of The White Lotus are now available to stream on HBO Max. Liam Gaughan is a film and TV writer at Collider.

                "value": "A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.\nBut Republicans could try to win over Democratic Senate moderates on some legislation.  If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden\u2019s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren\u2019t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.  Still, dozens of seats are in play, including many of those held by Democrats who won in suburban districts in 2018, winning the majority for the party that year.

All Rights Reserved. The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens. History also gives Republicans reason for optimism.\nAlthough election \u2018red wave\u2019 did not happen, GOP flipped enough seats to win slim majority in House of Representatives. United States Republicans have regained control of the House of Representatives, securing a narrow majority in a midterm election that saw the party fail to meet expectations. The Associated Press declared Republican Mike Garcia the winner in California\u2019s 27th congressional district Wednesday, giving the GOP 218 seats, the threshold for the majority needed to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will likely become House speaker when the new Congress convenes early next year after his party nominated him to the position on Tuesday. He will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi who has held the gavel since 2019. Although the much-anticipated \u201cred wave\u201d of Republican victories did not materialise, Republican candidates were able to gain at least five House seats in the November 8 midterms, wiping out the Democrats\u2019 thin majority.  Democrats were able to flip a few districts, but they suffered overall net losses, narrowly losing key races in New York, Florida and other states. Redistricting after the 2020 Census had given conservatives an edge in several parts of the country. Even with a less-than-ideal election performance, control of the House will allow Republicans to halt President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda in its tracks. In the US, bills need to pass in both the House and Senate and be approved by the president to become law.\nConnecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 ARTICLE Last Updated Dec. 7, 2022  IN THIS ARTICLE  What is the balance of power in the House?

The governor\u2019s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain undecided. Cortez Masto\u2019s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt\u2019s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters, 74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as a very tight race, is noteworthy.\nQuestion:Who won the U.S. Senate race in Nevada in the 2022 midterm elections?\nAnswer:"

She\u2019s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I\u2019ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that\u2019s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time. Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.\nWe've known for a while that Ncuti Gatwa is the next (well, it's a little more complicated than that right now, so spoiler alert for lower down the page) incumbent of the TARDIS, due to debut as the lead in Doctor Who next year. Now we know who will be his first main companion \u2013 Coronation Street's Millie Gibson, playing Ruby Sunday. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor\u2019s companion,\" she says. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s side, I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\" Ncuti Gatwa adds: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!\u201d Russell T. Davies, who brought the series back in 2005 for its big relaunch, is returning to run it again starting next year.\nThe TARDIS has a new passenger. The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started.\" \"Millie just is the companion,\" said Gatwa. \"She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail the universe with Millie!\nThe reveal of the 2024 companion feels like a throwback. The Doctor is traveling with only one human. In Doctor Who Season 14, coming 2024, not only will the eponymous Time Lord regenerate into Ncuti Gatwa but he\u2019ll also be joined by a human named Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson. With this new pairing for the TARDIS, aspects of the new Doctor Who are starting to feel a bit retro for longtime fans. Is Who going back to basics?  Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson; the new stars of Doctor Who. Following the brief \u2014 and as yet, unexplained \u2014 return of David Tennant as the Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa is set to become the incumbent Doctor by the end of 2023, and into the regular season, starting in 2024. And, on November 18, 2022, the BBC revealed that Millie Gibson will join Gatwa as the new companion. Interestingly, all the press around this news has focused on the word companion, as in a singular companion, rather than a group of companions. Throughout the tenure of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s 13th Doctor, the Doctor had a TARDIS team of three companions in Seasons 11 and 12, and two during the events of Flux (Season 13).\nAlthough the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series\u2014including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.\nQuestion:Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?\nAnswer:"

And now, photos exclusive to Vogue reveal that an Arab designer was a major part of the bride\u2019s big day. While she wore a Grace Kelly-inspired wedding gown by American brand Ralph Lauren to exchange vows with Peter Neal, Biden slipped into a sleek dress from Lebanese designer Reem Acra\u2019s namesake label for the reception and cake-cutting ceremony. Photo: Norman Jean Roy The ivory Mikado silk gown created by Beirut-born Acra came with a delicate strapless neckline, and was made notably special with pearls belonging to Biden\u2019s grandmother Roberta Buhle sewn into the sweeping six-foot train. Biden paired the dress with pearl jewelry of her own, and sheer gloves. Acra was also the designer of choice for First Lady Jill Biden, who wore two dresses from the brand on the day: A custom couture silk chiffon vintage blue dress with a teal wool crepe coat for the ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress for the black-tie reception. Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden is the daughter of US president Joe Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, and his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, and is an associate at the DC law firm Arnold & Porter.\nLopez topped them all, though, donning three custom dresses from Lauren for her nuptials with Ben Affleck last summer. In hindsight, Neal\u2019s and Biden\u2019s attendance at the designer\u2019s fall fashion show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York may have been a sign of her intentions.  \t           \tThe location of the private affair \u2014 the South Lawn \u2014 was a first for White House weddings. After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House\u2019s South Portico with Biden\u2019s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president\u2019s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden\u2019s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday\u2019s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nPresident Biden's granddaughter looked stunning in a long-sleeve gown. Ahead of Naomi Biden's wedding to Peter Neal, speculation over what designer President Biden's granddaughter would pick to design her wedding dress was high.  Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well\u2014as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.  The official social media accounts for President Biden and Dr. Biden tweeted, \"Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you.\" Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you. pic.twitter.\n\u201cThat was a big, big yes, because they\u2019ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.\u201d  When Biden and Moon visited O\u2019Neill\u2019s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. \u201c[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cWe talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.\u201d Ten of O\u2019Neill\u2019s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. \u201cWe worked really closely together on this,\u201d she added.   The project was a joy for O\u2019Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.\nQuestion:Who designed Naomi Biden's wedding dress?\nAnswer:"

The second round of group-stage fixtures have been completed. And now, every team in Qatar whose World Cup fate still hangs in the balance knows exactly what they need to do to progress to the knockout stage. Three teams have already progressed. The reigning world champions, France. The 2016 European champions, Portugal. And the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to win in Qatar, Brazil. Advertisement Two teams are out. The host nation, Qatar. And Canada. But what does every other team at the World Cup need to do to make it into the last 16? GO DEEPER The Radar - The Athletic's 2022 World Cup scouting guide After two games for each team in Group A, there is a three-way battle between Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal for the qualification positions. Qatar have been already eliminated. Occupying top spot and facing the hosts in their final game, Louis van Gaal\u2019s side will more than confident of picking up the point they need to book a last-16 place but they have some work to do. They will have to better Ecuador\u2019s scoreline to guarantee top spot.

Their 4-1 come-from-behind victory over Australia is a sign that they are not giving up their title without a fight despite a slew of injuries. Euro 2021 semifinalists Denmark are tipped to be the team best equipped to lay claim to the other knockout round berth on offer, but a 0-0 draw against Tunisia could hurt their chances.\u00a0 The Danes will now be sweating their Round of 16 berth given Australia did what they couldn't against Tunisia. The Socceroos claimed a 1-0 win over Tunisia to give themselves a shot at the Round of 16 in their group finale. That Australia vs. Denmark match on Wednesday will essentially serve as a playoff for a berth into the knockout rounds. It's worth noting that this group has reunited three teams that faced each other at the same stage of Russia 2018: France, Denmark and Australia were all part of Group C in that tournament, with France and Denmark going through and Australia finishing last.

If teams are tied on points, goal difference is the first tiebreaker followed by goals scored. If teams are also tied in those categories another set of tiebreakers is applied.\u00a0 The winners of the last World Cup in 2018, France will be determined to retain the crown, although they will have to fare considerably better than they did at Euro 2021, when they were knocked out at the Round of 16 stage by Switzerland.\u00a0 If superstar Kylian Mbappe is at his best, then it could make all the difference for Les Bleus, and there is plenty of other international experience also in Didier Deschamps\u2019 talented squad despite a rash of injuries heading into the tournament. France won the 2020/2021 UEFA Nations League by beating Spain in the final, and if they can perform as a cohesive unit then they will certainly be among the leading contenders for glory in Qatar.

                "value": "Paramount+'s new Criminal Minds series is Criminal Minds: Evolution.  By Mark McKee | Published 11 months ago  CBS had a relative TV goldmine from 2005 to 2020 when the FBI Behavior Analysis Unit traveled the country, bringing to justice the worst criminals within the borders.\u00a0Criminal Minds\u00a0revolutionized the murder mystery on TV with a stellar cast of characters that used their expert talents in human nature to chase after the worst the country had to offer. Spencer Reid, Derek Morgan, Jennifer Jareau, David Rossi, Aaron Hotchner, and Emily Prentiss captivated audiences for a decade and a half before the show came to an end in 2020. Fans didn\u2019t have to wait long for news of a revival, as the team couldn\u2019t stay away from a new series premiering this Fall on\u00a0Paramount+. The latest iteration of the series has now found its title.\u00a0Deadline reports\u00a0the\u00a0new series\u00a0will appear under the title Criminal Minds: Evolution.\u00a0 Just before the pandemic began, fans saw the BAU chase after The Chameleon to close out a series that had to create 15 years of diabolical murderers without allowing it to get stale. The series ended with Spencer Reid in a coma and traversing the memories of agents he worked with in the past.\nNext: Criminal Minds Reboot Confirms Who BAU\u2019s Most Important Character Is\nRelated: Criminal Minds Revival: Will Hotch Return In Season 16? It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen. Overall, despite the series of changes coming the BAU's way, it's all for the better.\nCook (JJ), Kirsten Vangsness (Penelope), Aisha Tyler (Tara), Adam Rodriguez (Luke) and Paget Brewster (Emily). As previously reported, Matthew Gray Gubler and Daniel Henney will not be reprising their roles as Spencer and Matt, respectively. Gilford\u2019s post-FNL TV credits include L.A.\u2019s Finest, Good Girls and, most recently, Midnight Mass. In officially confirming Criminal Minds\u2018 comeback back in July, Paramount+ president\u00a0Nicole Clemens said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cFor 15 seasons, Criminal Minds was at the forefront of cutting-edge scripted drama as it explored the psychology behind crime \u2014 thrillingly. The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at Paramount+. Erica, the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are sure will electrify audiences.\u201d Longtime Criminal Minds showrunner/EP Erica Messer will be back to oversee the revival, with\u00a0Breen Frazier and Chris Barbour returning as writers/executive producers. Comments are monitored, so don\u2019t forkin' curse and don\u2019t bore us with how much your coworker\u2019s sister-in-law makes per hour. Talk smart about TV!    Comment *  Name *  Email * Your email address will not be published. We will notify you when someone replies.\nThe Criminal Minds reboot on Paramount+ gets a brand new title which effectively resolves one of the biggest problems of the upcoming series.  The Criminal Minds reboot's new title - Criminal Minds: Evolution - resolves one of its biggest problems. Paramount+ is bringing back FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) to the small screen not long after the team wrapped up its run on CBS for 15 years. While the profilers will miss a couple of their co-workers such as Matthew Gray Gubler's Spencer Reid and Daniel Henney's Matt Simmons, the rest of the squad will be intact as they track down a network of UnSubs which was established during the coronavirus pandemic. Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it. It also hints that everything in Criminal Minds: Evolution is an evolved version of the original show, which seems to be the case.\nQuestion:What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?\nAnswer:"

The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule\u2019s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He\u2019s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he\u2019s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he\u2019s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d that he grew up \u201crevering\u201d the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. \u2014\u00a0Sherman He\u2019s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska \u2014 which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message.\nHis final season at Baylor included 11 regular season wins, a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game and a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl appearance.\u00a0 Then came a less stellar NFL stint that ended after an 11-27 record in two-and-a-half seasons. It\u2019s unclear what the exact contract details are as the Panthers owe over $40 million in buyout money. It\u2019s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach Mickey Joseph and Nebraska\u2019s assistants.\u00a0 Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago. The Huskers just wrapped up a 4-8 season and have not had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2016.\u00a0 But the financial resources, fan support, brand and facilities are in place to be competitive toward the top of the Big Ten. \u201cIt is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,\u201d Rhule said in a release. \u201cWhen you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top of the list.\u00a0 The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. sports@dailynebraskan.com Senior Sports Editor   Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.\nNew Head Football Coach Matt Rhule, live coverage right now on air @WOWT6News #Huskers pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn\u2019t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along with him, but said he would definitely be talking with \u2014 and listening to \u2014 players, coaches, and staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was fired, would be retained. \u201cI reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I\u2019ve been on both sides of it,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an assistant coach on a staff that\u2019s been let go, and I\u2019ve always appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I\u2019ll try to be thorough with that process over the next couple of days.\u201d Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely in Rhule\u2019s hands. \u201cUltimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule\u2019s decision,\u201d Alberts said. \u201cHe\u2019s the head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best opportunity.\u201d Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. \u201cMy son is this YouTube generation. I have seen the Tunnel Walk maybe 5,000 times.\nSenior Sports Editor Nebraska\u2019s football team hoists the Heroes Trophy after defeating Iowa at Kinnick Stadium on Friday, Nov. 25, 2022, in Iowa City, Iowa. Matt Rhule will be Nebraska\u2019s 31st head football coach, athletic director Trev Alberts announced on Saturday. After a quiet two-and-a-half month national search, Alberts landed on Rhule as the replacement for Scott Frost. This comes one day after reports from ESPN reporter Chris Low that the two parties were set to finalize a deal.\u00a0 Rhule will be returning to the collegiate ranks from the NFL after a stint as the head coach in Carolina. Despite being fired from the Panthers, Rhule has a recent track record of NCAA success, rebuilding Temple and Baylor.\u00a0 \u201cCoach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program,\u201d Alberts said in a release. \u201cMatt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\u201d He took the Owls from 2-10 his first season to back-to-back 10-win seasons his third and fourth years in Philadelphia, culminating in an American Athletic Conference title in 2016. The Bears were 1-11 in Rhule\u2019s first year in Waco, Texas then reached a bowl game in his second season.\nNovember 28, 2022        \u00b7       4 min read     Matt Rhule, a proven builder in college football, has been hired as Nebraska's next head football coach.  Rhule will be introduced as the Huskers\u2019 31st permanent head coach at 1:30 p.m. in the Hawks Championship Center. Fans are invited to gather at Gate 20 on the east side of Memorial Stadium at 12:50 p.m. to welcome Rhule to campus. A special viewing of the press conference will be offered inside Memorial Stadium. Fans can also watch the introduction online. Rhule was announced as the new head coach on Nov. 26 by Trev Alberts, vice chancellor and director of athletics.  The 47-year-old Rhule has built an impressive coaching resume over the past 25 seasons with experience at both the collegiate and professional levels. Rhule has served as a head coach for the past 10 years, including seven seasons in the collegiate ranks and three seasons in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers. Alberts said success as the head coach at Temple and Baylor provides evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska. \"It is a privilege to welcome Coach Matt Rhule, his wife Julie, and their family to Nebraska,\" Alberts said. \"Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program.\nQuestion:Who is Nebraska's new head football coach?\nAnswer:"

The post received over 3 million views and was inundated with comments.\nText to speech (TTS) tech has been around for quite some time, so you must\u2019ve come in contact with it, perhaps even without realizing it. Have you seen\u00a0Mandalorian? When they revealed Luke Skywalker, they made use of voice-cloning in that one. They also used a primitive version of TTS in\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0to give HAL a unique voice. In short, TTS tech is all about machine and deep learning that allows the program to read and convert text into audio files. Similar kinds of algorithms are used to analyze and then reproduce existing and create new voices, too. So, the text-to-speech voice on TikTok that you like hearing is actually an AI voice produced by an underlying speech synthesis algorithm that you can\u2019t really meddle with. But, even if you can\u2019t mess about with it as you would with some open-source voice-changer or TTS tool, it\u2019s still sufficient for quick video editing and TikTok voice-over work, and its popularity corroborates that.

It comes as the company continues to tap into potential revenue sources. The company\u2019s revenue in the third quarter surged 65.4% year over year to 238.1 billion South Korea Won ($183 million), with net profit reaching 29.2 billion won.  SM Entertainment already has a presence in the Southeast Asian region. In Indonesia, the company\u2019s branch has won brand endorsements such as Mie Sedaap and Sasa for Choi Siwon of K-pop boy band Super Junior, and Somethinc and Lemonilo for NCT Dream, according to CNBC.\nSouth Korean multinational company SM Entertainment will set up its Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore as a part of its plan to expand in the region. On December 1, 2022, CNBC confirmed the news and also shared that SM Entertainment has signaled their future recruitment plans in Singapore through an email. On top of that, the K-pop label also plans to kickstart retail businesses in Singapore, including cafes, merchandise stores, pop-up stores, and more. Moreover, the company will not limit its expansion to Singapore but wants to establish itself in the Middle East too. As per CNBC, the Singapore headquarters will also overlook ventures in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, while simultaneously communicating with the Korea office. For a wider reach in Asia, SM Entertainment is going beyond the Korean borders to establish its Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore. Although the company has not shared the financial details of the Singapore venture, they plan to hire locals to grow their staff count in the country. Moreover, they are planning to recruit undergraduates or fresh graduates for internships. In his interview with CNBC, Lee Soo-man, founder of SM Entertainment, said his team likes to nurture talent through the Cultural Technology system he developed years ago. The systematic K-pop training system, started by Lee Soo-man, allows singers and dancers to excel in four stages: casting, training, marketing/management, and producing. Additionally, he has been determined to produce another NCT subunit, NCT Singapore, if the opportunity comes.\nIn Japan, SM co-publishes Avex Trax releases for artists including Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and Koda Kumi, as well as Johnny's Entertainment artists such as Arashi and KAT-TUN.[12]  After graduating from California State University, Northridge in the United States, Lee Soo-man returned to Korea and in 1989 established what was then known as \"SM Studio\" in the Apgujeong neighborhood of Gangnam, Seoul and signed singer Hyun Jin-young. During the 1990s, SM Studio developed an in-house system that looked after all aspects of its artists' careers.[13] Lee's approach was targeted at teenage audiences, and took a holistic view of the qualities needed to become a successful entertainer.[14] In February 1995, the company changed its name to SM Entertainment and set up its capital fund.[15] SM then developed an in-house production system and created a string of successful artists, including boy band H.O.T. in 1996, girl group S.E.S. in 1997, boy band Shinhwa in 1998, R&B duo Fly to the Sky in 1999, and soloist BoA in 2000.  Jung Hae-ik was appointed CEO at the time of SM's official reestablishment in 1995,[16]  and was succeeded by Kim Kyung-wook in 1998.[citation needed]\nFounder Lee Soo-man also teased the formation of NCT sub-units from Tokyo, Saudi Arabia and potentially Singapore South Korean entertainment company SM Entertainment will be setting up its Southeast Asian headquarters in Singapore.

According to CNBC, SM Entertainment are currently in the process of recruitment for its Singapore branch. SM Entertainment\u2019s Singapore base of operations will be \u201cmanaging joint ventures in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, as well as communicating with [its South Korea office] for other related ventures and plans.\u201d Lee Soo-man, founder of SM Entertainment, also told the outlet that he would be keen on launching an NCT sub-unit in the region dubbed NCT Singapore, however it remains unclear if these plans have been set in stone. Despite declining to share specifics of the company\u2019s investment in its expansion into Singapore, representatives of SM have shared that it is currently \u201cin the midst of hiring more local talents, which will hopefully increase the full-time staff count\u201d. Its Singaporean office is also looking to hire \u201clocal undergraduates or fresh graduates for internships\u201d.\n23] The firm's first release from SM was Super Junior's fifth studio album, Mr. Simple, which marked the end of SM's self-distribution. In May, SM announced its highest ever first quarter operating profits, at KR\u20a910.4\u00a0billion, up 471% from the same period the previous year. Gross revenue was reported at KR\u20a922.7\u00a0billion, a 58% increase on the previous year.[24]  In April 2011, SM, YG, JYP, KeyEast, AMENT, and Star J Entertainment came together to form United Asia Management, a joint investment agency geared towards advancing Asian music worldwide. That August, SM joined with Thai media company TrueVisions to create an international joint venture, SM True.[25]  In 2012, SM debuted the large-scale boy group Exo, split into two units in order to promote in Korea and China simultaneously.[26] In February, SM acquired Hawaiian travel firm Happy Hawaii and launched SMTown Travel, a new business initiative specializing in travel and tourism under Kang Jung-hyun.[27][28] Later that year, SMTown Travel offered package deals for overseas fans attending Super Junior's Super Show 4 Tour encore concerts in Seoul.[29] In March, 47 of SM's recording artists became stockholders of the company.\nQuestion:Where is SM Entertainment setting up its Southeast Asian headquarters?\nAnswer:"

And we're going to find out if we can be successful doing that,\" Berhalter said in a panel interview after the roster announcement.\nThe following table includes players who have captained the United States men's national soccer team (featuring all caps, goals and assists or goalkeeper wins and shutouts) from April 16, 1989, through February 2, 2022, a game with Honduras. Values come from U.S. Soccer Federation Media Guide.  All other Captain amounts from 1916 to 1988 are based on extensive research of game film, match statistics and match lineups found on numerous websites,[1][2][3][4] which have been able to place a captain with every FIFA USMNT Match.\nBecky Sullivan                        Christian Pulisic, center, with Tyler Adams, just left, Gio Reyna, far left, and Sergi\u00f1o Dest, right, pictured during ahead of a friendly match between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in September.

All four players made the World Cup roster. With ten days to go until the 2022 men's FIFA World Cup begins in Qatar, U.S. Soccer has announced the 26-man roster for the national team.  The United States men's national soccer team (USMNT) is making their return to the World Cup after its embarrassing failure to qualify for the 2018 tournament. It was the first time the U.S. had missed the World Cup since the 1980s.  Now, in a quest to turn the page, the U.S. will feature one of its youngest World Cup teams ever, handing its reputation over to a new generation of players.  \"This generation hasn't yet defined themselves.\nTyler Adams will captain the US men\u2019s national team into the 2022 FIFA World Cup, head coach Gregg Berhalter announced on the eve of Monday\u2019s Group B opener vs. Wales (2 pm ET | FOX, Telemundo). The Leeds United midfielder and New York Red Bulls homegrown product will be the USMNT\u2019s youngest captain since Walter Bahr at the 1950 World Cup. He\u2019s already worn the armband nine times during 32 career international appearances. \u201cWe think he has great leadership capabilities,\u201d Berhalter said of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. \u201cHe leads by his actions and his words.\u201d FIFA requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32 Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter\u2019s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. \u201cA lot of credit to my teammates,\u201d Adams said, \u201cbecause anyone throughout our leadership council can wear that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way.\" Adams debuted for the Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.\nHis emotional control and composure are a huge part of what he does.\u00a0 \"He is not afraid to 'carry the water', to do the dirty work, to really grind. His communication style is not all big speeches, it's very one-to-one. He listens as much as he talks. And he can communicate nonverbally, because people pick up on that better.\" Walker didn't instantly concur with the method Berhalter chose in allowing his players to pick the World Cup captain but says the coach \"wore me down.\" He made the point that such a democratic way of choosing a leader only works if the culture of your group is strong. The longer this tournament progresses, the more united this USA squad appears. \"Tyler is the perfect captain for this group,\" Walker added. \"He is one of them. It is remarkable to think, he's the same age as (Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback) Trevor Lawrence. He's younger than (current Steelers QB) Kenny Pickett. He's younger than the Michigan punter. This could be an NCAA team by age, and their main leader reflects that.\" Christian Pulisic is the best-known U.S. player and has the nickname \"Captain America\" at Chelsea, but Adams' role and spot on the field are better suited to the captaincy.\nQuestion:Who is the captain of the USA soccer team in the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "We like companies that had rewarded investors\u2014or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement. More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage: Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: Costco How we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year Costco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analysts Why some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that way Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.\nYahoo Finance unveils its 2022 Company of the Year: Costco. - Let's get to the top three things you need to know as the clock hits 9:00 AM. We've got the big reveal. Yahoo Finance has crowned the 2022 Company of the Year. We're going to bring you the details, plus interviews with top executives all day here at Yahoo Finance. You don't want to miss it. - Oh my. I wonder who it is. But first, a check on the markets. Futures are slightly in the red here to start the week after a better than expected jobs report on Friday casts doubt on how quickly the Fed can ease the pace of interest rate hikes. - Plus, stocks in Hong Kong and mainland China are in rally mode after local authorities took more steps to ease COVID-19 policies, giving hope of a full reopening in China. - But we begin today with my favorite story. The end of the year is upon us. And that means Yahoo Finance, we have unveiled or officially announced its 2022 Company of the Year. The land of $1.50 hot dogs and unmatched customer loyalty takes the crown this year. And you guessed it, it's Costco, folks. I flew out to the Costco stomping grounds in Washington to go inside the retailer's business. Here's what I learned. Costco has seen a lot since opening its first warehouse store in Seattle, Washington in 1983.\nShares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they\u2019re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1. And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the \"meme\" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it\u2019s down 87%%. Zoom out. Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so. Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation\u2019s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up\u2014including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises. Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don\u2019t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory.\nCostco Wins Yahoo Finance's 2022 \"Company of the Year\" Award: In a year of eye-popping inflation for everything from gas to eggs hammering households, Costco played the role of trusted friend. The retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam\u2019s Club did. Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in the summer months. The company was often the last grocer to raise prices on household essentials despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive sales gains seemingly every month of the year, a stock price that relatively out-performed the S&P 500 and Yahoo Finance\u2019s coveted \u201cCompany of the Year\u201d award. The headlines for online-car buying platform Carvana (CVNA) haven\u2019t been good recently. And whether the company will remain a public entity is now in doubt.  In fact my colleague Rick Newman wrote a column dubbing it Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cWorst Company of the Year.\u201d Despite a stock down XX% this year, concerns over its debt load, and weather management has the know-how to right the business, it seems one thing may actually stick around - the trend of buying used cars online.\nIt\u00a0seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today. Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year\u2019s woes include a wrong turn into the \u201cmetaverse,\u201d where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion. Other Company of the Year setbacks? Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block\u2014as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down.\nQuestion:Which company won Yahoo Finance's 2022 \"Company of the Year\" Award?\nAnswer:"

The bailout was approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to\u00a0more than 200\u00a0nearly insolvent multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. \"With today's actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve,\" Biden\u00a0told\u00a0the cheering crowd at a Cleveland high school. Millions of union workers, that is. If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way\u2014even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security\u00a0looms on the brink of insolvency. Oh, and you'll have to pay back (with interest!) the money borrowed to make\u00a0this\u00a0bailout (and the rest of the American Rescue Plan) possible. Sounds like a great deal, right?\n(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)       WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s administration on Thursday announced the infusion of nearly $36 billion to shore up a financially troubled union pension plan, preventing severe cuts to the retirement incomes of about 350,000 Teamster workers and retirees across the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s about everything you worked for,\u201d Biden said, with union officials standing behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding a dignified retirement.\u201d The money for the Central States Pension Fund is the largest amount of federal aid provided for a pension plan, the Biden administration said.

This matters for their spouses, this matters for their mothers and fathers who they\u2019re taking care of ... It matters for the country.\u201d  Many union retirement plans have experienced financial pressure because of underfunding and other issues. Without the federal assistance, Teamster members could have seen their benefits reduced by an average of 60% starting within a couple of years. \u201cUnion workers and their families are finally able to breathe a huge sigh of relief, knowing that their hard-earned retirement savings have been rescued from steep cuts,\u201d said Lisa Gomez, assistant labor secretary for employee benefits security.\nWithout the federal assistance, Teamster members could have seen their benefits reduced by an average of 60 percent starting within a couple of years. \u201cUnion workers and their families are finally able to breathe a huge sigh of relief, knowing that their hard-earned retirement savings have been rescued from steep cuts,\u201d said Lisa Gomez, assistant labor secretary for employee benefits security. WATCH: Biden spotlights rescued pensions for millions during visit to Ohio While bargaining for contracts in past years, union members chose to forgo raises and other benefits on the assumption they would would have \u201ca prosperous retirement,\u201d Teamsters General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien said in a written statement. But when the retirement fund faltered, union members turned to lobbying the federal government for help. \u201cThis is an issue of fairness \u2014 of this country keeping its word to hardworking, honest people who did everything they were supposed to do in life,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Multiemployer pension funds are created by agreements between unions and companies and are partially insured by the federal government\u2019s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The insurance program was on track to become insolvent in 2026, but the pandemic relief money is expected to keep it on firm footing through 2051. Biden traveled to Ohio in July to\u00a0highlight the final rules for the pension relief program. Before Thursday, the program had awarded aid to 36 troubled pension plans, but none of those had received more than about $1.2 billion.\nQuestion:How much money will President Joe Biden put into the union pension plan?\nAnswer:"

Here\u2019s what you need to know: Williams was the best quarterback in America this season, so the Maxwell Award was deserved. Williams led USC\u2019s turnaround from a four-win team to a top-10 squad in 2022 and elevated the players around him. Now his sights turn to Saturday night and the Heisman Trophy. \u2014 Morales Duggan\u2019s story has been one of the best in college football, starting TCU\u2019s season as the backup quarterback before leading the Horned Frogs to a 12-0 start. His toughness and perseverance helped pull the Frogs out of multiple second-half deficits and without his poise, leadership and production late in games, TCU wouldn\u2019t be in the College Football Playoff.

He's the fourth USC player to win the Maxwell Award, the first since Marcus Allen in 1981, when Allen also went on to win the Heisman Trophy. Williams was also the CBS Sports Player of the Year this season. Max Duggan did beat out fellow Heisman Trophy finalists Caleb Willams and C.J. Stroud for the Davey O'Brien Award, given to the nation's best quarterback, and his honor came as part of a big night for TCU.

African countries have been competing at the World Cup since 1934 \u2014 Egypt withdrew in 1930 after missing their connecting ship to Uruguay as a result of a storm \u2014 and have made a total of 49 appearances in the competition. Advertisement Those appearances have been made up of 13 different countries, from Morocco and Tunisia in the north to South Africa at the very southern tip of the continent. The Athletic takes a look at Africa\u2019s rich history at the World Cup and how each of these teams has fared.\nPreliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).  All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.\n1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament\u2019s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist.

                "value": "Charlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time.           Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as \u201cgoing from the frying pan and into the fire.\u201d           \u201cI don\u2019t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that\u2019s the reason I took the job,\u201d said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. \u201cI could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.\u201d           As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions.           On the first day of the men\u2019s basketball tournament, Baker \u2013  who played basketball at Harvard \u2013 discussed with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers.           And he also told CNN why he thinks there\u2019s so much excitement for March Madness.\nThe NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  The first issue for the next NCAA president: What is the association even going to look like for Mark Emmert's successor? That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal.\nCharlie Baker assumed the duties as the NCAA's sixth\u00a0president on March 1, 2023.\u00a0 He was hired for the position on Dec.\u00a015, 2022, as he neared the conclusion of his term as the 72nd governor of Massachusetts. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country is\u00a0a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation. Baker earned widespread support by taking on issues with significant real-world impacts, and approaching them in substantive, innovative\u00a0and bipartisan ways.\nMedia Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J. DeGioia announced by mutual agreement with the board that Mark Emmert will be stepping down as president of the NCAA.\u00a0 He will continue to serve in his role until a new president is selected and in place or until June 30, 2023.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Throughout my tenure I've emphasized the need to focus on the experience and priorities of student-athletes,\" said Emmert.\u00a0 \"I am extremely proud of the work of the Association over the last 12 years and especially pleased with the hard work and dedication of the national office staff here in Indianapolis.\" \"With the significant transitions underway within college sports, the timing of this decision provides the Association with consistent leadership during the coming months plus the opportunity to consider what will be the future role of the president,\" said DeGioia. \"It also allows for the selection and recruitment of the next president without disruption.\" NCAA member schools adopted a new constitution in January and are in the process of transforming the structure and mission to meet future needs. 08.07.23 08.03.23 08.03.23 08.02.23 08.02.23 Thanks for visiting !

Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it\u2019s now called \u2014 and it\u2019s a woman. He did not name her but said she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter \u201cprobably toward the end of this year.\u201d (May 11) Elon Musk confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal\u2019s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with deep ties to the advertising industry.  \u201cI am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!\u201d Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino \u201cwill focus primarily on business operations\u201d while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships.  Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which is now called X Corp.  Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at Twitter, however.  \u201cWhile he\u2019s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step back from calling the product shots,\u201d said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.\nMusk has hired former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino, who modernised the advertisement business at the media firm. Former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino will become Twitter\u2019s new CEO, current chief executive Elon Musk says in a tweet, as the social media platform seeks to reverse a plunge in advertisement revenues. \u201cI am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!\u201d Musk said on Friday. \u201c@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.\u201d Yaccarino, who modernised the advertising business at the Comcast Corp entertainment and media division, will have her hands full as she takes on a firm loaded with debt, among other challenges. Since Musk acquired Twitter in October, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 percent of its staff. Musk this year acknowledged that Twitter suffered a massive decline in advertisement revenue. Musk has axed thousands of employees, rushed the launch of a subscription product that allowed scammers to impersonate major brands and suspended users with whom he disagreed. Twitter\u2019s \u201ctrajectory will immediately take a 180-degree turn\u201d under Yaccarino\u2019s leadership, said Lou Paskalis, a longtime advertisement industry executive and CEO of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy.\n160] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an \"annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million\".[161] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[162] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[163] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[164] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[165] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[166][167] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[168][169]  In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[170] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2\u00a0billion in share buybacks.\n152] On October 16, 2008,[153] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[154] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and \"be completely focused on product strategy\".[155][156]  According to The New York Times, \"Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship\" when Williams was away.[157] According to PC Magazine, Williams was \"no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company\". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to \"help in any way [he could].\"[158] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[157]  In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[159] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s advertising executive will take over as boss, with Musk holding on to senior role in company Elon Musk has named NBCUniversal\u2019s head of global advertising as the new chief executive of Twitter, although he will continue to have a senior role at the social media platform. Linda Yaccarino will take over as chief executive from the billionaire, who has proven to be controversial and unpredictable in the role since he bought the company for $44bn last October. Musk indicated that he will still play a prominent role at Twitter, tweeting that Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he will concentrate on product design and new technology. Before confirming Yaccarino\u2019s appointment, Musk had also tweeted that he would become executive chair.

The sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters and $300.5 million internationally for a $434.5 million global debut, according to studio estimates on Sunday.  It tied with \u201cThe Batman\u201d as the fourth highest domestic debut of the year, behind \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\u201d ( $187.4 million in May ), \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d ( $181 million in November ) and \u201cThor: Love and Thunder\u201d ($144.2 million in July).  Expectations were enormous for \u201cAvatar 2,\u201d which carried a reported price tag of over $350 million, the pressure of following up the highest grossing film of all time (thanks in part to various re-releases) over a decade later and the daunting task of propping up an exhibition business that\u2019s still far from normal. Everything \u201cAvatar\u201d is oversized, though: the Na\u2019vi characters, the runtime (a staggering three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century Studios and The Walt Disney Co.  Going into the weekend many were expecting a domestic debut of at least $150 million.\nJames Cameron\u2019s highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water earned $53 million in its opening day release in the U.S., almost double the opening day success of its blockbuster predecessor, although it\u2019s only the sixth-best film opening this year, and Cameron needs it to be a huge blockbuster to justify its nine-figure budget. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009\u2019s Avatar\u2014the highest-grossing film of all time\u2014opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported\u2014nearly double the $26.7 million the first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150 million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5 million) and The Batman (56.6 million). It was also narrowly edged out by Jurassic World Dominion, another sequel in the rebooted Jurassic Park franchise, which made $59.5 million on its opening day.\nSome even said $175 or higher, but tracking has also not been as reliable a metric during the pandemic.  Disney saw early that \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d was going to be a different kind of beast when they looked at pre-sales. For a normal, spoiler-heavy movie like many Marvel offerings, post-opening weekend sales are usually around 5%. For \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d they were at 20%. In other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a terrific movie that is playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,\u201d said Tony Chambers, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the screens and we\u2019ve got a clear run. This isn\u2019t about the opening day or the opening weekend. This is about the entire run.\u201d The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on Thursday evening. Domestically, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D format and premium large screens.

Guillermo del Toro wins Oscar for best Animated Feature Film for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio LOS ANGELES -- \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" has had an Oscar wish come true. The director's stop-motion, musical take on the puppet who longs to be a real boy won Netflix its first animated feature trophy on Sunday. The category has primarily gone to either a Walt Disney or Pixar-produced film for the past decade - with the exception of \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" \"Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. We are all ready for it. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" Del Toro said. \"Pinocchio\" was considered the contender to beat. It swept several awards including the Golden Globe and the top honor at the animation industry's Annie Awards. The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. It earned rave reviews for a stunningly beautiful production that takes a dark look at issues of love and mortality between the titular puppet and surrogate father, Gepetto. A polar opposite of Disney's 1940 version, this \"Pinocchio\" references Catholicism, fascism and the ugliness of war.\nHowever, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]  From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]  In 2010, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol (2009) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, James stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as Bailey put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\nEven though 'Puss In Boots: The Last Wish' put up quite a fight, 'Pinocchio' has dominated the circuit  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tClayton Davis  Senior Awards Editor  Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.\nQuestion:What movie won the Oscar for Best Animated Film in 2023?\nAnswer:"

An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.\u00a0 Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.\u00a0 The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.\u00a0 Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break free from Earth's gravitational hold.\n2022 YG is a near-Earth asteroid and a potential quasi-satellite of Earth, discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov at Nauchnyi,\u00a0...\nOur planet has a strong gravitational connection with the Moon.

Previous \"mini moons\" included asteroids 2020 CD3\u00a0and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will be with us deep into the next century.\u00a0 There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past.

Yes.\nThe main difference between the $6.99 Personal subscription and this new $1.99 Basic one (other than the amount of cloud storage) is that Microsoft 365 Basic doesn\u2019t include access to the desktop versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps.

Called Microsoft 365 Basic and priced at $1.99 per month or $19.99 per year, the plan will initially include 100 GB of storage, Outlook email and access to support experts for help with Microsoft 365 and Windows 11. Existing OneDrive 100 GB subscribers will be transitioned to Microsoft 365 Basic beginning January 30 as well, Microsoft says. And in the coming months, Microsoft 365 Basic plan members will get \u201cadvanced security features\u201d like ransomware recovery and password-protected sharing links in OneDrive. Importantly, Microsoft 365 Basic is not replacing the free Microsoft 365 tier.

This has become a trend for Netflix to release a buzzy title in the days leading up to Christmas. In the past, hit films such as Don't Look Up, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Bird Box, and 6 Underground were released on the service during the holiday season. Rebel Moon will have a limited theatrical release in the weeks before it lands on Netflix. As of right now, it is unknown when that'll be and how many theaters will screen the film. Snyder's previous film with Netflix, Army of the Dead, screened for one week in May 2021 across 600 theaters in the US. Rebel Moon will likely follow a similar route.  There is no trailer for Rebel Moon. That being said the first pieces of footage for the film were released in a sizzle reel for Netflix's 2023 film slate, which you can watch above. A behind-the-scenes featurette for Rebel Moon was unveiled during Netflix's Tudum event on June 17, 2023, previewing the film's massive scope and several of the cast-members reactions to working with Snyder on the film.\nTrending TV, movie and anime news, plus reviews and analysis. As Zack Snyder\u2019s sci-fi epic Rebel Moon heads to Netflix, here\u2019s everything you need to know from its release date and trailer to cast, plot, and more. Director Zack Snyder is known for his stint in the DCEU, with movies such as Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. Now, after leaving the DCEU behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead and the forthcoming Rebel Moon.  The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023\u2019s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for the streaming platform. So, if you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ll want to be updated with all things Rebel Moon. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.  Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023. The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2.  Filmed back-to-back, Zack Snyder\u2019s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the Netflix space opera we know today.\nAnd, with two movies already in the works, Netflix obviously has high hopes that Rebel Moon will be the start of a major sci-fi franchise. Here's everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's ode to Star Wars.  Rebel Moon is Netflix's big Christmas blockbuster and will land on the platform on December 22, 2023. That won't be the end of the story, however, because Netflix has decided to split Snyder's epic in two, meaning a sequel is definitely on the way. \"When we saw how big the world [Snyder] created was, we thought it would be better served as two pieces versus one film,\" Ori Marmur (one of the bosses of Netflix's original film group) told Variety. \"It's the kind of story that can continue to grow.

In 2022, the projected larger trade deficit is driven by strong growth in imports. That increase in the trade deficit will reverse, CBO projects, starting in the beginning of 2023\u00a0as exports rise by 6.0\u00a0percent (at an annualized rate) but imports rise by only 1.6\u00a0percent over that year. CBO expects growth in exports to outpace growth in imports because economic conditions among major U.S.\nAfter 2023, in CBO\u2019s projections, tightening monetary policy and several other factors combine to slow the growth of demand, slowing output growth and further reducing inflationary pressures. Under the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged, CBO projects that real GDP will grow by 3.1\u00a0percent in 2022\u00a0(as measured from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022). That expansion is driven by strong growth in consumer spending and real business investment and by a shrinking U.S. trade deficit (see Table 2-2). The growth of real GDP declines steadily through 2024, led by slower growth in consumer spending and investment, before remaining almost constant through 2026. In the agency\u2019s projections, real GDP grows at an average annual rate of 1.6\u00a0percent from the beginning of 2023 through 2026.  Data source: Congressional Budget Office.

In CBO\u2019s forecast, economic output expands less rapidly from 2027 to 2032 than it does over the 2022\u20132026 period. Real GDP grows by 1.7\u00a0percent per year, on average. Real potential GDP grows at a marginally faster rate.3 The level of real GDP is slightly below the level of real potential GDP from 2027 to 2032, in line with their historical relationship, on average.\nAltogether, CBO now estimates that actual output was about 1.3\u00a0percent less in 2021\u2014but potential output was about 0.2\u00a0percent greater\u2014than the agency expected last July. In terms of underlying trends that contribute to growth of real potential GDP over the 2022\u20132031\u00a0period, revisions are very modest, and the average annual growth rate over the period, slightly greater than 1.8\u00a0percent, is practically unchanged. In nominal terms, however, the agency\u2019s projections of output and income are higher throughout the projection period because projected inflation over the next several years is above the rates anticipated in July. Nominal GDP is 4.9\u00a0percent higher, and national income is 3.9\u00a0percent higher, in 2031 than CBO projected last summer. CBO currently projects the unemployment rate to be slightly lower and the labor force participation rate to be slightly higher over the 2022\u20132031 period than in the agency\u2019s July 2021 forecast. CBO\u2019s current projection of the average unemployment rate over the 2022\u20132026\u00a0period is slightly lower than it was in that earlier\u00a0forecast\u2014now 3.8 percent, down from 4.0 percent. The current projection of the labor force participation rate is also lower\u2014now 62.1\u00a0percent instead of 62.4\u00a0percent.\nQuestion:What was the annual GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Here's everything to know about Shazam! Fury of the Gods.   Shazam! Fury of the Gods wouldn't be possible without the return of its titular character played by Zachary Levi. Plus, his teenage counterpart Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel, will also be making his return.   Other cast members set to reprise their roles include Jack Dylan Grazer, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Jovan Armand and Grace Caroline Currey as Billy's foster siblings \u2014 while their superhero alter egos will be played by Adam Brody, Meagan Good, Ross Butler and D. J. Cotrona.   New cast members have been recruited to join the sequel as well, including Helen Mirren as Hespera, the daughter of Atlas, alongside Lucy Liu who's cast as her demigod sister, Kalypso. They are the primary villains in Shazam's second installment.   Rachel Zegler, who starred in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, is also cast as their sister in the film, playing the role of Athena, one of three goddess daughters of the Titan Atlas \u2014 of which the actress said \"was so much fun\" to play.\nBetween who's joining the cast and when it's slated to premiere, here's everything to know about the sequel to 2019's Shazam! starring Zachary Levi Skyler Caruso is the Editorial Assistant of PEOPLE Digital.  No magic word needed: a Shazam! sequel is already underway!   DC Comics' hit superhero movie is getting a reprisal with Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the highly-anticipated follow-up film that comes four years after its predecessor's theatrical release in April 2019.   Zachary Levi is making his return as the titular superhero character opposite Asher Angel, who is reprising his role as Shazam's teenage alter ego, Billy Batson. Familiar faces from the franchise are also set to appear in the film's second installment, plus several newcomers.   The news of Levi's return, specifically, came amid fan speculation that he would be cut from the franchise as the studio's newest CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran reconfigured the future of DC movies including Henry Cavill's departure as Superman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 3 being canceled.   In addition to concerns regarding the cast, backlash arose surrounding DC Studios' future storylines. Gunn posted a statement on Instagram reading, \"Disrespectful outcry will never, ever affect our actions\" regarding the company's upcoming movie slate \u2014 to which Levi commented, \"Amen. \ud83d\ude4f.\"\nRelated: Shazam! Big Screen History, Explained Billy Batson is played by Asher Angel while the superhero adult form of Shazam is played by Zachary Levi. The character wears his comic book character's signature red outfit with a white cape and lightning bolt on his chest. Shazam, originally named Captain Marvel, was at one point the most popular superhero in the world and even outsold Superman comics. The character has the potential to be a major part of the DCU; if the sequel does well, there's little doubt he can fit him into James Gunn and Peter Safran's new plans for the franchise. Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have. One of the most courageous members of the group (representing Achilles), his kid form is played by Jack Dylan Grazer, while his adult form is played by Adam Brody. A notable thing about Freddy Freeman is, while originally under the name Captain Marvel Jr., was the favorite superhero of rock icon Elvis Presley.\n26] In October 2020, the release date was once again shifted to June 2, 2023. Later release dates were December 16, 2022 and December 21, 2022. In August 2022, the final release date of March 17, 2023 was announced.  In June 2020, Marta Milans confirmed that she would reprise her role as foster mother Rosa V\u00e1squez from the first film, and revealed that filming had been delayed by the pandemic.[15] The film's title was revealed to be Shazam! Fury of the Gods during the virtual DC FanDome event in August 2020, with returning cast members confirmed including Asher Angel as teenager Billy Batson and Levi as his adult superhero counterpart, Jack Dylan Grazer as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman and Adam Brody as his adult counterpart, Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley and Meagan Good as her adult counterpart, Grace Fulton as Mary Bromfield, Ian Chen as Eugene Choi and Ross Butler as his adult counterpart, and Jovan Armand as Pedro Pe\u00f1a with D. J. Cotrona as his adult counterpart.[7][11] The next month, Levi said filming would begin in early 2021.[11]  The film's release was delayed again in October 2020, to June 2, 2023.\nBefore being reborn by saying the magic word \"Shazam,\" an acronym of the immortals Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, this muscled do-gooder in spandex was just a kid named Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel. You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) picked him as his successor. \"Put your hands on my staff,\" demanded the Wiz. \"Gross!\" said Billy, in a response that typified the script's \"Deadpool\"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that cheeky attitude still pops through in \"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\" as Billy/Shazam and his kid besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler for Eugene,  D.J. Cotrona for Pedro and Currey playing both versions of Mary -- take on their greatest challenge yet.\nQuestion:Who will be playing the role of Billy Batson in Shazam! Fury of the Gods?\nAnswer:"

CEO Shou Zi Chew's testimony before Congress did little to assuage U.S. worries over TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance and added fresh momentum to lawmakers' calls to ban the platform nationwide. Over five hours of testimony, Chew repeatedly denied the app shares data or has connections with the Chinese Communist Party and argued the platform was doing everything to ensure safety for its 150 million American users. Chew said TikTok for more than two years has been \"building what amounts to a firewall to seal off protected U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access. The bottom line is this: American data stored on American soil, by an American company, overseen by American personnel,\" Chew said. But not a single lawmaker offered support for TikTok, as they deemed Chew's answers on China evasive and aired concerns over the power the app holds over U.S. children. Others accused TikTok of promoting content that encourages eating disorders among children, illegal drug sales and sexual exploitation. \"TikTok could be designed to minimize the harm to kids, but a decision was made to aggressively addict kids in the name of profits,\" said Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat, at the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce committee hearing.\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) today announced that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will appear before the committee to testify on TikTok\u2019s consumer privacy and data security practices, the platforms\u2019 impact on kids, and their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.

The Energy and Commerce Committee has been at the forefront of asking Big Tech CEOs \u2013 from Facebook to Twitter to Google \u2013 to answer for their companies\u2019 actions. These efforts will continue with TikTok. ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access American user data. Americans deserve to know how these actions impact their privacy and data security, as well as what actions TikTok is taking to keep our kids safe from online and offline harms.

The tenth and final season has begun airing on NBC for its final run and will hit Netflix later this year. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Since 2013, The Blacklist is a crime thriller series led by James Spader. Over the years, we\u2019ve seen the former criminal turned FBI informant capture dozens of criminals. The Blacklist was announced to return for a tenth season on NBC back in February 2022. Only later on was it revealed that season 10 would be the final outing for the show and as a result, no season 11 is planned.  Filming got underway on season 10 in September 2022 and cast Anya Banerjee as Siya Malik. It\u2019ll once again be a 22-episode long season with James Spader, Diego Klattenhoff, Hisham Tawfiq, and Harry Lennix returning.\nWe earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article. What lies in store next? The Blacklist spoilers follow. The Blacklist's combination of twist-filled scripts, fast-paced direction, and brilliant performances has kept it going as strong today as it did when it first aired back in 2013, so it's not surprising that NBC renewed the crime thriller for another season.  But what can we expect from the next chapter? Here's everything you need to know about The Blacklist season 10. The airdate has finally been confirmed, and we'll be getting new season 10 episodes of The Blacklist on Sunday, February 26 at 8/7c on NBC.  It's great news for fans. The move from Friday to Sunday could potentially open up the show to a wider audience. It's a more traditional slot for a show like this \u2013 even if that does mean it'll have more like-for-like competition, going up against NCIS: Los Angeles and The Equalizer on CBS. And we could even end up seeing a Blacklist movie, whether the shift is successful or not.  \"That construct of the windowing combined with the fact that streamers really want movies, movies are driving platforms, has, in my opinion, made the movie business economically better,\" NBC CEO Jeff Shell said (via The Express).\nThe tenth and final season of the American crime thriller television series The Blacklist was ordered on February 22, 2022[1][2] and premiered on February 26, 2023, on NBC.[3] The season concluded the series on July 13, 2023 with the final two episodes.[4]  James Spader, Diego Klattenhoff, Hisham Tawfiq, Harry Lennix returned for the season, while Anya Banerjee debuted in a new main role. It is the only season of the series not to star Amir Arison and Laura Sohn after their promotion to main cast, though Arison makes a guest appearance; it is also the second and final season without Megan Boone.[5]  The season is produced by Davis Entertainment, Universal Television and Sony Pictures Television. John Eisendrath, John Davis, Joe Carnahan and John Fox continue to serve as executive producers of the series, while series creator Jon Bokenkamp returned as an executive producer.[6]  On February 22, 2022, James Spader announced the renewal of the series while making his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, with the NBC press release coming out shortly after.[28]  On February 1, 2023, NBC officially announced that the season would serve as the last of the series.[2] The same day, the poster and the trailer for the season were released.\nQuestion:When will the final season of The Blacklist premiere?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Jerry Seinfeld, trapped in algorithmically generated limbo Seinfeld was famously described as \"a show about nothing,\" and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre, AI-generated Seinfeld episode has been streaming on Twitch for a full month, titled \u201cInfinite Nothing.\u201d The never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much \u201cabout nothing,\u201d as algorithmically animated Seinfeld characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 language model, with minimal human moderation. In an interview with Vice, Skyler Hartle, the co-creator of \u201cNothing, Forever,\u201d explained the thinking behind the project: \u201cThe actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project,\u201d Hartle said. \u201cBut then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\u201d \u201cAside from the artwork and the laugh track you'll hear, everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music,\u201d one of the creators wrote in a Reddit comment.\nFiled under: Cue the incessant laugh tracks  In a twist of technology that only 30 Rock could have predicted, an AI-generated version of Seinfeld is now taking over Twitch. The stream, hosted by a channel called watchmeforever, uses generative artificial intelligence to create an infinite stream of Seinfeld-esque content online. The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.  The content comes at a time when generative AI seems to be cropping up everywhere. Here\u2019s what you need to know about AI Seinfeld on Twitch.  AI Seinfeld is a Twitch stream called \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d that plays AI-generated content based on Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David\u2019s \u201990s comedic sitcom, Seinfeld. The show has been formally running since Dec. 14, but the group behind it, Mismatch Media, just started sharing in the past week. It sports a chunky 3D pixel style that looks a video game, and computerized voices that deliver an endless stream of Seinfeld-esque antics.  Skyler Hartle, a member of Mismatch Media, told Polygon that the stream uses various AI software to bring the show to life. The text generation comes from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 models and the speech comes from Azure Cognitive Services.\n\u201cIn addition to the third party services we\u2019ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be \u2018formed\u2019, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the \u2018director,\u2019 as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole,\u201d Hartle said via email. \u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that we don\u2019t generate the artwork or the laugh track \u2014 those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.\u201d  Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of \u201990s point-and-click games that came out around the same time as Seinfeld. \u201cWe thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically relevant,\u201d Hartle said over email.  This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn\u2019t really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.  One popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It\u2019s titled, \u201cElaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.\nThe result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI\u2019s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they\u2019re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: \u201cAs generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.\u201d After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn\u2019t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying.\nThe surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it\u2019s never really gone away \u2013 it\u2019s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the \u201cstory\u201d \u2013 if you can call it that \u2013 of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, \u201cwe have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be \u2018formed\u2019, so to be speak,\u201d Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. \u201cWe collectively call this logic the \u2018director\u2019, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole.\nQuestion:What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?\nAnswer:"

He added that the legislation is also Republicans\u2019 response to conservative parents who, in recent years, have claimed that public schools advance a liberal agenda in the way they teach race and history or by holding books in the library some parents find obscene. Gov. Kim Reynolds held a closed meeting last spring with parents from Linn-Mar schools who were upset with a policy that allows students in seventh grade and older to keep their gender support plans private. Wills said that policy is one justification for a vast expansion of state funding for private schools in Iowa. \u201cWhy would a parent want to want to choose an Educational Savings Account? Well, maybe they don't trust the public schools anymore,\u201d Wills said. \u201cThis is a school refusing to tell parents about their children. Maybe that's why parents choose to go someplace other than public school.\u201d Under the school choice bill, starting next fall, families would be able to apply for Education Savings Accounts, or ESAs, worth $7,598 that they could use to pay for educational expenses such as private school tuition. A fiscal analysis prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimates that, in the first year of the program, 14,068 children would receive Education Savings Accounts, including 4,841 transferring from public to private schools. The program would cost $106.\nThe Students First Act, introduced by Governor Reynolds and signed into law on Jan. 24, 2023, makes state funding available to support the success of every K-12 student in Iowa. The bill establishes a framework and funding for education savings accounts (ESAs), which may be used by eligible families to cover tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses at accredited nonpublic schools in Iowa. The State Board of Education adopted administrative rules on May 4, 2023, that specify definitions for the program, eligibility requirements for participation, parameters for the application process, and program administration and accountability. The Students First ESA Application\u00a0available in English and Spanish. The application window for the 2023-2024 school year runs from 8 a.m. on May 31 through 11:59 p.m. June 30, 2023. Note:\u00a0Parents/guardians will first be directed to sign up with an email and password. Parents/guardians will receive a message from Odyssey asking them to confirm their email address.\u00a0After the email is confirmed the parent/guardian can sign in to the Odyssey platform to begin their application.  Parents who choose to enroll their eligible children in an accredited nonpublic school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funding allocated to public school districts for the same budget school year.\nIowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the option of choice \u2013 and they should be. But public schools aren\u2019t the only choice, and for some families, a different educational path may be better for their children.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governor Reynolds believes Iowa\u2019s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Students First Act signed into law\u00a0 On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address.\u00a0The bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools. It also provides public schools\u00a0with additional categorical funding for students who live in their district but attend private schools,\u00a0and allows public school districts to use unspent money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries.\u00a0 Education Savings Accounts\u00a0 With the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses.\nDES MOINES\u00a0--\u00a0Governor Reynolds signed HF 68 into law today amid hundreds of supporters in the Iowa State Capitol. The\u00a0Students First Act\u00a0makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools.\u00a0 \u201cPublic schools are the foundation of our education system and for most families they will continue to be the option of choice, but they aren\u2019t the only choice,\u201d Governor Reynolds stated. \u201cFor some families, a different path may be better for their children. With this bill, every child in Iowa, regardless of zip code or income, will have access to the school best suited for\u00a0them.\u201d\u00a0 Universal eligibility will be phased in over three years. All incoming Kindergarteners and all public-school students will be eligible beginning year one with the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Eligibility for families of children currently enrolled in accredited private schools will be income based over the first two years.\u00a0 Parents or guardians who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all\u00a0public school\u00a0districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses. The state has issued a request for proposal (RFP) from businesses with experience managing ESA programs.\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under Iowa\u2019s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds\u2019 voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.\nQuestion:What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?\nAnswer:"

It declared a \u201ccode red\u201d in response to ChatGPT\u2019s release, making A.I. the company\u2019s central priority.\nDigital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It\u2019s an AI chatbot, and it\u2019s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn\u2019t officially replaced Google Assistant, it\u2019s a far more powerful AI assistant. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI \u201clearn\u201d natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public.\nA message from our CEO Feb 06, 2023 min read AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Whether it\u2019s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That\u2019s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago \u2014 and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we\u2019ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore\u2019s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. It\u2019s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people. That\u2019s the journey we\u2019ve been on with large language models.\nAdvertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public\u2019s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company\u2019s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google\u2019s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google \u2014 more than any other big tech company \u2014 has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.\nFrom imagining the prime minister leading a cabinet meeting about war to a guide on how best to start your own podcast, Google's LaMDA AI is certainly flexible. By  Tom Acres, technology reporter   Saturday 5 November 2022 19:41, UK The scene is 10 Downing Street, the home of the prime minister. It's a crisp, cool day. A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos, realistic speech, and even write fiction.                    Is this the future of comedy?

I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is Midjourney\u2019s mission?  We like to say we\u2019re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it\u2019s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society? I\u2019m definitely more concerned about society than business. We\u2019re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. Right now, our professional users are using the platform for concepting.\nFounded by David Holz, co-founder of Leap Motion, Midjourney is a creative tool that can be used in various fields to create unique and captivating images with a bright future ahead of it Menu Contact  Immersion Rue de l\u2019Enseignement 50 1000 Bruxelles Horaire* Lundi: 13:00 \u2013 22:00 Mardi: 13:00 \u2013 22:00 Mercredi: 13:00 \u2013 22:00 Jeudi: 13:00 \u2013 22:00 Vendredi: 16:00 \u2013 22:00 Samedi: 13:00 \u2013 22:00 Dimanche: 13:00 \u2013 20:00 * Teambuilding ou Ev\u00e9nements sont possibles en dehors des heures d\u2019ouverture A propos Centre de R\u00e9alit\u00e9 Virtuelle situ\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du Cirque Royal.\u00a0 Plongez-vous dans une nouvelle \u00e8re d\u2019Escape Games exclusivement disponibles chez Immersion.\nMidjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called \"prompts\", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.[1][2]  The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022.[3] The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion.[4] Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable.[5] Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands.[6]  Midjourney, Inc. was founded in San Francisco, California by David Holz,[7] previously co-founder of Leap Motion.[8] The Midjourney image generation platform first entered open beta on July 12, 2022.[3] However, on March 14, 2022, the Discord server launched with a request to post high-quality photographs to Twitter/Reddit for system's training.  The company has been working on improving its algorithms, releasing new model versions every few months. Version 2 of their algorithm was launched in April 2022[9] and version 3 on July 25.\nThey say, \u201cI feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it\u2019s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.\u201d  But there\u2019s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit; I don\u2019t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.\u201d Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don\u2019t have a process for that yet, but we\u2019re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn\u2019t have that many artists in it. It\u2019s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like \u201cwe don\u2019t really feel intimidated by this\u201d answers. Right now, it\u2019s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we\u2019re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that\u2019s been surprising to me.\nHe ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.\nQuestion:who founded midjourney?\nAnswer:"

REDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine on Tuesday that incorporates cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, which company executives hope will help it eventually dethrone Google as the No. 1 search service. Microsoft is teaming up with OpenAI, the San Francisco research lab behind ChatGPT, to revamp Bing so that it can handle more complicated queries alongside providing factual information. \"It's a new day for search,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an announcement made at the company's headquarters on Tuesday. \"In fact, a race starts today in terms of what you can expect.\"  Microsoft's announcement that it is doubling down on what is considered the hottest new technology is a direct challenge to Google, the dominant player in online search for decades. Google controls about 90% of the online search market. Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi provided a demonstration of the retooled Bing at a briefing with reporters. The new version is being teased for the public in a \"limited preview,\" with a true public launch coming soon, executives said.\nMicrosoft Bing (commonly known as Bing) is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.  Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called \"Explore pane\") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.[4]  In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search.[5] Yahoo! finished the transition in 2012.[6]  In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as \"Tiger\", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Microsoft announced a new version of its search engine Bing is integrating artificial intelligence chat in a step the tech giant hopes will bolster its place in the online search business (Feb. 7) (AP Video: Manuel Valdes) REDMOND, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft\u2019s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that\u2019s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.  Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \u201cThink of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful\u201d than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview. A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge.\nKnown as \"Tiger\", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.[29] In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes \"Sidebar\", a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search query.[8]  The BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of the search engine were made open source by Microsoft in 2016.[9][30]  On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing that included a new chatbot feature based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[31] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[32] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[33] On May 4th, Microsoft switched from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remains available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app, but no longer requires a Microsoft account (there are limitations).[34][35][36][37]  When Microsoft demoed the new Bing to journalists, it produced several hallucinations, including when asked to summarize financial reports.\nIs this self-harm? If it is, we catch it. And then we don't even let it go into the model,\" he said. \"An important part of today is, now we can go to market and try it with real testers, because you can't solve these problems in the lab. You have to get out and see it in the real world.\"                  Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi shows off the company's relaunched Bing search engine powered by artificial intelligence.

The new Bing also allows users to ask questions and receive answers that sound conversational based on the latest news, unlike the publicly available version of ChatGPT, which was limited because it relied on 2-year-old information.  The AI powering Bing uses technology that is faster and more advanced than what the public has experienced so far, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, told reporters, and it has been fine-tuned by Microsoft to be optimized for search.  \"I feel like we're been waiting this for 20 years, so I'm very excited it's here,\" Altman said. \"I think this is the beginning of a very new era.\nQuestion:What technology has Microsoft incorporated into the new Bing?\nAnswer:"

While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I\u2019m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.\u00a0 I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story. Over time, I decided he would be an outstanding CEO for our next chapter. Our board of directors met him and felt the same way.\nI look forward to working closely with Ben, the Board and the rest of the leadership team to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead and usher in Pinterest\u2019s next chapter of growth and success.\u201d   About Bill Ready   Ready joined Google as President of Commerce in January 2020 and was appointed President of Commerce, Payments and Next Billion Users in April 2021.

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn\u2019t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel\u2019s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that\u2019s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar\u2019s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries. The final Pikmin 4 trailer shows off more aspects of the world, including home interiors.\nPikmin 4 is so close to lanching on the Nintendo Switch, and here's when fans can expect to jump into the digital version. Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch. People who decided to pre-order the game digitally via the Switch eShop are probably wondering just when they'll be able to actually boot the game and start playing --that's where this guide comes into play. RELATED: Pikmin 4 Fans Are Paying for Ads of the Game to Appear Over Time Square Before we get into it, it's worth pointing out that this is the expected release time for Pikmin 4 --it has not been officially confirmed by Nintendo just yet.\nHowever, the Japanese gaming company tends not to share that information for each individual release; although there is information on its support page regarding the time most first-party Switch games should release. According to the support page, \"Digital software that is also sold physically will usually be available at 9:00 p.m. PT the night before the physical game's release date.\" This gives us the confirmation that Pikmin 4 will more than likely be available to start playing the night before launch, at least in the United States. Fans on the west coast will be able to jump in at 9 PM PT on Thursday night, and those on the east coast (NYC) should be able to play it around midnight.

And how big a deal do you think that is in terms of the impact it has on the company?SCHECHNER: Well, I mean, you can see it from - people inside the company are anxious. You know, Mark Zuckerberg sends a message to staff, and it's 2,200 words long. And, you know, there's some mea culpas in there. But there's also this vision that he's trying to get across of a leaner, more nimble company. And he's actually, at points in this memo, talking about how he thinks it will - and is making things operate more efficiently, more effectively than before.PFEIFFER: During the pandemic, Meta and many other tech companies were just hiring madly. So are these layoffs essentially returning Meta to its pre-pandemic level, or do you see it going deeper than that? Any idea?SCHECHNER: Well, we'll have to see where it ends up landing. But, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, in this memo, what struck me is that he said that this is something that he sees continuing for many years. It's a new economic reality.\nNPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to Wall Street Journal reporter Sam Schechner about the layoffs which will cut about 12% of Meta's workforce. This round follows a previous cut of 11,000 jobs. SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:  Meta is planning a second round of layoffs. That's the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. And it announced yesterday it will cut another 10,000 jobs. This follows 11,000 layoffs at Meta last November. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that 2023 will be Meta's, quote, \"year of efficiency.\" He also says it will be, in his words, stronger and more nimble. We're joined now by Wall Street Journal technology reporter Sam Schechner. Sam, thanks for coming on.SAM SCHECHNER: A pleasure to be here.PFEIFFER: These are a lot of layoffs, but I want to make sure we put it in the overall context of how large Meta is. So tell us, how many employees does it have now? How many will it have left once the layoffs are done?SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the company said.\nBy  Alex Heath and  Emma Roth Meta will lay off an additional 10,000 employees through multiple rounds of cuts over the coming two months, close hiring for 5,000 open roles, and cancel more low-priority projects, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday. These cuts come just four months after he laid off 11,000 employees, or 13 percent of the company, last November. The first wave of layoffs will start this week and impact Meta\u2019s recruiting organization, followed by a second wave for tech roles in April and a third focused on business roles in late May. \u201cMy hope is to make these org changes as soon as possible in the year so we can get past this period of uncertainty and focus on the critical work ahead,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a memo to employees that was also posted on his Facebook page. He called the collapse in Meta\u2019s revenue growth last year a \u201chumbling wake-up call\u201d and told employees that \u201cwe should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.\u201d \u201cHigher interest rates lead to the economy running leaner, more geopolitical instability leads to more volatility, and increased regulation leads to slower growth and increased costs of innovation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven this outlook, we\u2019ll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.\u201d  In a separate filing with the SEC, Meta said the new cuts will lower the high end of its expense guidance for the year by $3 billion.\nMeta has started another round of layoffs amid the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d The latest job cuts are the third round of a series of cuts first announced in March. The company said it expected to shed a total of 10,000 jobs over the course of three rounds. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many workers are impacted by the latest round, but the layoffs, once again, seem to be primarily in non-engineering roles. People in marketing, communications, and recruiting have lost their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited posts on LinkedIn. Meta will also be slashing nearly 500 jobs from its Irish office, about 20 percent of its workforce in the country, according to a separate report. Meta declined to comment on the cuts. A spokesperson pointed to a memo Mark Zuckerberg shared with employees last fall when the company conducted an earlier round of 11,000 layoffs. In the message, he said that economic conditions had \u201ccaused our revenue to be much lower\u201d than expected. He described  the job cuts as \u201csome of the most difficult changes we\u2019ve made in Meta\u2019s history\u201d and \u201cwhat we need going forward.\u201d Zuckerberg has talked openly about the need for more \u201cefficiency\u201d in the months since. He  dubbed 2023 as Meta\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d and said he wants to create a \u201cflatter\u201d management structure at the company.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the cuts to overhiring during the pandemic. In a letter to staff posted to the corporate website, he cited a decline in e-commerce, the wider economic downturn, increased competition, and a decline in ad sales\u2013the primary way the company makes money.   \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" he wrote.  The layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so-called metaverse, pitched as a virtual-reality future in which people will work, mingle, exercise and go to concerts. But it's an unproven bet on the future, and not all everyone is convinced it should be the social media company's focus.                   Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made big investments in the \"metaverse,\" which he showed off during a virtual event last year. Last week, Zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13% of its staff.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13% of its staff. Zuckerberg said the workforce cuts would affect the whole organization, with recruiting staff disproportionately affected due to fewer hires anticipated in the coming year. A hiring freeze through the first quarter of 2023 will continue.\nQuestion:How many employees did Meta lay off in November?\nAnswer:"

According to a document iRobot filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, it also was the second time Amazon tried to buy the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner and other household robots. The new information reveals more background on how Amazon, which already has a large robotics presence in Massachusetts, scooped up one of the area\u2019s oldest and most influential robotics firms. Amazon first tried to buy iRobot in the fall of 2016, the filing said, but iRobot\u2019s board of directors determined the offer \u201cundervalued\u201d the company at $60.50 per share. In the coming months, iRobot\u2019s stock price increased, and Amazon ended its acquisition discussions. Advertisement The next time Amazon expressed interest in buying iRobot was on May 16 of this year, when an Amazon representative called Colin Angle, cofounder and chief executive of the company. Amazon proposed acquiring iRobot for $64 per share in cash about a month later. Again, iRobot believed Amazon\u2019s offer undervalued the company. On June 29, iRobot issued a counteroffer to Amazon, asking for $70 per share. On the same day, iRobot told Amazon that it anticipated a second-quarter earnings miss. This meant iRobot also planned to lower its revenue projection for the year.\nInformation regarding iRobot's directors and executive officers, including a description of their direct interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is contained in iRobot's proxy statement for its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 11, 2022, and will be included in the Proxy Statement (when available). iRobot stockholders may obtain additional information regarding the direct and indirect interests of the participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the proposed transaction, including the interests of iRobot directors and executive officers in the transaction, which may be different than those of iRobot stockholders generally, by reading the Proxy Statement and any other relevant documents that are filed or will be filed with the SEC relating to the transaction.

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs  defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38\u201335. The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14\u20133 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24\u201314, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38\u201335 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others.\nR&B artist Babyface, a 12-time Grammy Award winner, will perform \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d (with Colin Denny performing in ASL) and Abbott Elementary star Sheryl Lee Ralph will perform \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d (Justina Miles in ASL) before the game.       The Eagles are 2-point favorites to win the Super Bowl over the Chiefs.  The initial Super Bowl line for total points set minutes after the Chiefs\u2019 win over the Bengals was at 49.5, but it has moved up to 51. Some sports books opened with the Eagles as -2.5 favorites, but most are at -2 or -1.5 (a game with no favorite).  The lines could change in the days ahead. Here are the latest gambling odds and prop bets for Super Bowl LVII:      The bulk of the NFL\u2019s playoff overtime rules were implemented in 2010, with one change approved by the league\u2019s competition committee last spring that allows for both teams to possess the ball at least once before a winner can be determined.  The change was made following renewed scrutiny of playoff overtime rules after the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 AFC divisional playoff win over the Buffalo Bills in January 2022. Prior to the possession rule change, 10 of the 11 playoff games that went to overtime under the post-2010 overtime rule changes were won by the team that received the ball first.\nThe conference championship games are over and the countdown to Super Bowl LVII begins. Super Bowl LVII (57) will be played at 3:30 p.m. PST on Sunday, Feb. 12. It will take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., the home of the Arizona Cardinals. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the game.      The Philadelphia Eagles will play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. The Eagles are playing in the Super Bowl for the second time in six seasons following their 31-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC championship title. The Eagles are looking to win their second Super Bowl title following their victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII in 2018. The Chiefs reached the Super Bowl with a thrilling 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC championship game. Harrison Butker\u2019s 45-yard field goal in the closing seconds sealed the win for the Chiefs on Jan. 29. It marks the second Super Bowl appearance in three years for the Chiefs following their loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV in February 2021.

It focuses on code readability and optimizations to run on consumer GPUs. As of the time of writing this article, you can run Lit-LLaMA on GPUs with 8 GB of memory \ud83e\udd2f. Note: Currently you need to download the official Meta AI LLaMA pre-trained model weights for fine-tuning or running inference. Lit-LLaMA supports training, fine-tuning, and generating inference. Let\u2019s discuss each functionality in detail. Note: We won\u2019t go into too many details about training LLaMA from scratch and instead focus more on fine-tuning and inference because the computational need for training is not available to everyone in the community. The repo comes with a simple and readable LLaMA model implementation and a training script accelerated by Fabric. Large language models may not fit into a single GPU. Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a technique that shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel workers. Fabric provides a unified API that makes it easy to use FSDP. To use FSDP (Fully-Sharded Data Parallel) with Fabric, create an FSDPStrategy object by specifying the auto-wrap policy and passing it as an argument to the Fabric class.\nGiven my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?\u00a0 After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can\u2019t do it right, don\u2019t do it at all. If you can\u2019t spend all the time training, it won\u2019t be worth it.\u00a0\u00a0 These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person\u2014and every llama\u2014is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son\u2019s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.\u00a0 We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That\u2019s why I like to find out who\u2019s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people\u2019s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way.

You can fine-tune Lit-LLaMA on the Alpaca dataset using LoRA and quantization on a consumer GPU. Lit-LLaMA comes with a simple script for downloading and preparing the Alpaca dataset, which you can find here. Note: You can convert the official Meta AI LLaMA weights to Lit-LLaMA format using the instructions here. Follow these two simple steps to instruction-tune LLaMA: Find the full fine-tuning code here. To generate text predictions, you will need trained model weights. You can use either the official Meta AI weights or the model that you have fine-tuned.\nThis was accomplished using the new \"Ghost attention\" technique during training, that concatenates relevant instructions to each new user message but zeros out the loss function for tokens in the prompt (earlier parts of the dialog).  LLaMA was announced on February 23, 2023, via a blog post and a paper describing the model's training, architecture, and performance.[1][2] The inference code used to run the model was publicly released under the open-source GPL 3 license.[11] Access to the model's weights was managed by an application process, with access to be granted \"on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers; those affiliated with organizations in government, civil society, and academia; and industry research laboratories around the world\".[2]  On March 2, 2023,[12] a torrent containing LLaMA's weights was uploaded, with a link to the torrent shared on the 4chan imageboard and subsequently spreading through online AI communities.[3] That same day, a pull request on the main LLaMA repository was opened, requesting to add the magnet link to the official documentation.[13][14] On March 4, a pull request was opened to add links to HuggingFace repositories containing the model.[15][13] On March 6, Meta filed takedown requests to remove the HuggingFace repositories linked in the pull request, characterizing it as \"unauthorized distribution\" of the model.\nAdvancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I\u2019d never done before.\u00a0 So we went on a two-hour llama hike.\u00a0 When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son\u2019s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama\u2019s personality.\u00a0 As we continued to walk, my son\u2019s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.\u00a0 And that\u2019s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone\u2014according to the llama outfitter\u2019s Google reviews\u2014have such a great experience?\nQuestion:who trained LLaMA?\nAnswer:"

By Teresa Xie Here's everything you need to know about the 95th Academy Awards ceremony: When are the Oscar Awards this year?\nOn the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37]  When the nominations were announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4\u00a0million; this was followed by Elvis ($151\u00a0million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70\u00a0million), The Fabelmans ($15\u00a0million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9\u00a0million), Tar ($5.6\u00a0million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2\u00a0million), and Women Talking ($1.1\u00a0million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]\nHis win, among the most expected of the night, was nevertheless one of the ceremony\u2019s most moving moments. The audience \u2014 including his \u201cTemple of Doom\u201d director, Steven Spielberg \u2014 gave Quan a standing ovation as he fought back tears.  \u201cMom, I just won an Oscar!\u201d said Quan, 51, whose family fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child.  \u201cThey say stories like this only happen in the movies. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d said Quan. \u201cThis is the American dream.\u201d  Minutes later, Quan\u2019s castmate Jamie Lee Curtis won for best supporting actress. Her win, in one of the most competitive categories this year, denied a victory for comic-book fans. Angela Bassett (\u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d) would have been the first performer to win an Oscar for a Marvel movie. Curtis is the rare Oscar winner whose parents were both Oscar nominees: Tony Curtis was nominated for \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d in 1959 and Janet Leigh was nominated in 1961 for \u201cPsycho.\u201d  The German-language WWI epic \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d \u2014 Netflix\u2019s top contender this year \u2014 took four awards as the academy heaped honors on the craft of the harrowing anti-war film.

Ngor, who won for his role in 1984's The Killing Fields.[14][15] The 42-year span between Judd Hirsch's first nomination, for his supporting role in 1980's Ordinary People, and his second, for The Fabelmans, set the record for the longest gap between Oscar nominations.[11] At age 90, Best Original Score nominee John Williams became the oldest person nominated competitively in Oscars history.[11] Best Costume Design winner Ruth E. Carter was the first Black woman to win two Oscars.[16]  Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021).[17]  The Academy held its 13th annual Governors Awards ceremony on November 19, 2022, during which the following awards were presented:[18]  The following presented awards and performed musical numbers.[21]  In September 2022, the Academy hired television producers Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner to oversee production of the 2023 ceremony.\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this blog post ran an incorrect photo.

By Emily Olson Host Jimmy Kimmel is up first with his host's monologue.  Stay tuned for more updates.   By Bob Mondello No matter who takes home the gold statuettes tonight, 2023 will be remembered as a watershed year for Asian actors at the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them \u2013 Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and Stephanie Hsu (best supporting actress) \u2013 play the laundromat-owning multiverse-hopping family in Everything Everywhere All at Once. Also in the supporting actress category is Hong Chau, who plays the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale. While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year\u2019s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy. With no Black actors nominated for lead performances and no women feature directors nominated, there are still areas of the multiverse that need exploring. Check out our interviews with Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh and read more about this record nominations year.\nOn the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37]  When the nominations were announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4\u00a0million; this was followed by Elvis ($151\u00a0million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70\u00a0million), The Fabelmans ($15\u00a0million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9\u00a0million), Tar ($5.6\u00a0million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2\u00a0million), and Women Talking ($1.1\u00a0million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]\nAnd RRR's \"Naatu Naatu\" will be performed live by Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All at Once leads with 11 nominations. Following with nine nods each are Martin McDonagh's The Banshees of Inisherin and Netflix's World War I film All Quiet on the Western Front.  Angela Bassett's supporting actress nomination for her role as Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the Marvel franchise's first Oscar nomination in an acting category. And Michelle Yeoh makes history as the first Asian-identifying nominee for best actress.

By Gabe Cohn The 95th Academy Awards were held Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the proudly weird sci-fi movie from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, swept most of the top categories, including best picture and directing. Michelle Yeoh, that movie\u2019s star, won the best actress award, becoming the first Asian actress ever to win that honor. The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (\u201cThe Whale\u201d), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio,\u201d which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d; \u201cNavalny,\u201d which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who became the first Black woman to have won two Oscars (this time for \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d); \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front,\u201d which won several awards in the first half of the show, including for best international feature, production design and cinematography; and Sarah Polley, who won the best adapted screenplay honor for \u201cWomen Talking.\u201d See below for a full list of winners.\nThis is a list of submissions to the 95th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film every year since the award was created in 1956.[1] The award is presented annually by the Academy to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.[1][2] The International Feature Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films.[2] The category was previously called the Best Foreign Language Film, but this was changed in April 2019 to Best International Feature Film, after the Academy deemed the word \"Foreign\" to be outdated.[3]  For the 95th Academy Awards, the submitted motion pictures must be first released theatrically in their respective countries between 1 January 2022 and 30 November 2022. The deadline for submissions to the Academy was 3 October 2022,[4] and 93 countries submitted a film.[5] Uganda submitted a film for the first time, and Tanzania made a submission for the first time since 2001.[6][7]  After the 15-film shortlist was announced on December 21, 2022, the five nominees were announced on January 24, 2023.\nQuestion:Which movie won Best International Feature Film at the 95th Academy Awards Ceremony?\nAnswer:"

The company says new members will see the updated pricing starting today while existing subscribers will pay more beginning April 18th.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latest in a long line of YouTube TV price hikes. Before the latest increase, it had last raised them by $15 in June 2020. The service started at a mere $35 in 2017 and has ballooned incrementally as cord-cutting television has evolved from a scrappy disruptor to oh my god this costs $73 every single month. A message sent this morning to YouTube TV subscribers reads, \u201cAs content costs have risen and we continue to invest in the quality of our service, we are updating our price to keep bringing you the best possible service.\u201d In addition, the email notes that the service has dropped the cost of its 4K Plus add-on from $20 to $10 per month. The message also guides users to cancel their subscriptions if the new monthly fee pushes pricing out of their comfort zone. An update for our members. As content costs have risen and we continue to invest in our quality of service, we\u2019ll be adjusting our monthly cost, after 3 years, from $64.99/mo to $72.99/mo, in order to bring you the best possible TV service.\nThe new YouTube TV price is just for new subscribers, with existing subscribers seeing the price increase from $64.99 per month starting April 18.

While it doesn't have as many channels as some of the other services (mainly Sling TV, which has more options, and DirecTV Stream, which has a slew of more expensive plans), it's good value, with local TV channels available via streaming and free, unlimited cloud-based DVR (record as much as you want and watch at your leisure). YouTube TV also has continued to add new add-on options. HBO Max is available, as is Showtime. There's also a Sports Plus bundle with NFL RedZone, Fox Soccer Plus and more. And it also has most of the major Paramount Network channels, including Comedy Central, MTV and BET. One of the few streaming services in the United States to still offer one, YouTube TV has a free trial period that lets you test the service before you pay. The YouTube TV Base Plan usually has a seven-day free trial period, which should be more than enough time to make sure that it's something you want to pay for. But the lengths of trial periods can vary. Free trials for add-on networks have separate sign-up and billing.\nYouTube TV is available nationwide in over 99.5% of                             households in the United States.

Around the same time, he had already been working to start his own AI company, according to Nevada business records. \u2014With reporting by the Associated Press.

Legal Statement.\nBy  Jay Peters and  Emma Roth Elon Musk has created a new company dedicated to artificial intelligence \u2014 and it\u2019s called X.AI, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk\u2019s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating \u201cit seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.\u201d The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the \u201cX\u201d label he\u2019s applied to his vision of an \u201ceverything app.\nTwitter owner Elon Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company named X.AI, according to a Nevada business filing from last month. The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company\u2019s sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk\u2019s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a complete AI development pause, citing \u201crisks to society\u201d he says the technology poses. \u201cRecent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one \u2013 not even their creators \u2013 can understand, predict, or reliably control,\u201d a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development pause last month. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk warned that \u201cAI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production.\u201d  \u201cIn the sense that it has the potential \u2014 however small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivial \u2014 it has the potential of civilization destruction,\u201d he said. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle. He has reportedly sought to build a rival to OpenAI, recruiting artificial intelligence engineers for a new venture for months.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks with presenter Xenia Wicket at the Offshore Northern Seas 2022 (ONS) ... [+] meeting in Stavanger, Norway on August 29, 2022. (Photo by CARINA JOHANSEN/NTB/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk has formed a new AI company in Nevada called X.AI Corp., according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. Musk is listed as the director of the company and Jared Birchall, widely considered to be Musk\u2019s right-hand man behind the scenes, is listed as the company\u2019s secretary. Musk publicly called for a six-month pause in the development of artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Musk from going full steam ahead in developing his own AI. Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015 but left the company after a power struggle in 2018. Musk has made some big hires from the world of artificial intelligence lately, including Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss, according to a reporter earlier this week from Insider. Babuschkin was hired away from DeepMind, the AI arm of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It was assumed last month that Musk was going to work on AI under the umbrella of Twitter, a company he purchased in October 2022, but it\u2019s now clear he wants to develop AI with this new independent company in Nevada. Technically, Twitter Inc.\nArtificial intelligence has become a hot market in recent years, with Microsoft investing up to $10 billion in OpenAI and other tech giants like Google and Amazon entering the space to compete with already-present startups. The company joins Musk\u2019s broad portfolio alongside Twitter, automaker Tesla, SpaceX, tunneling company Boring and biotech firm Neuralink. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He\u2019d remain there for the first half.   We\u2019ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.  We\u2019ll take that as a major plus, for now.\nThe Virginia Tech Hokies wrapped up their Spring portion of the off-season with the 2023 Annual Spring Game. The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC Network. It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday: \u00a01. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue\u00a0to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells\u00a0executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.\nVirginia Tech coach Brent Pry reacts after a West Virginia touchdown, as Chamarri Conner (25) returns to the sideline during the second half of an NCAA college football game Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022, in Blacksburg, Va.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1\u00a0billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16\u00a0billion globally in 2011.\nThese new retail locations mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers. To celebrate the opening of the new Apple BKC store,\u00a0Apple has created special wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The company is also promoting a special\u00a0Apple Music playlist featuring \u201csounds of Mumbai.\u201d There are also wallpapers and a unique playlist to promote the new Apple Saket store in New Delhi. Last month,\u00a0Apple opened a new retail store in South Korea\u2019s Gangnam District with a unique glass facade. A report from the\u00a0Economic Times\u00a0suggests that some Apple executives including retail chief Deirdre O\u2019Brien will be there for the grand opening. It won\u2019t be a surprise if other Apple executives like CEO Tim Cook will be at the opening day of the first Apple Store in India. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

He joined 9to5Mac to share even more tech news around the world.\nTwo decades after entering India, Apple is gearing up to launch its first set of retail stores in the populous South Asian nation, signaling the tech giant\u2019s growing interest in the market. Apple said on Tuesday it plans to open Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18 and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20. The iPhone-maker\u2019s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple\u2019s expansion efforts. Despite being the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple\u2019s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation\u2019s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations \u201cmark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.\u201d In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country.\n(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has scheduled a trip to open the iPhone maker\u2019s first stores in India next week, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions for the country as a growth market and manufacturing base.

Apple said Tuesday it\u2019ll open a store in Mumbai on April 18 and another in New Delhi on April 20. The trip comes seven years after the CEO\u2019s maiden visit in 2016 and coincides with the world\u2019s most valuable company hitting important markers: India sales of iPhones reaching an all-time high and annual iPhone exports from the country reaching billions of dollars. Apple is betting on India to diversify its assembly operations beyond China amid strained Beijing-Washington relations. Cook is set to open Apple\u2019s first India store inside an upscale mall in the Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC as the neighborhood is called.\nMr Roy says that Apple's decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It's not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.\nQuestion:Where are Apple's first two stores in India?\nAnswer:"

CEO Pichai had said in January that top executives, including him would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the company\u2019s history. Last month, Google\u2019s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts. Amid the mass layoffs, global recession fears and economic uncertainty, this mammoth compensation was a big boost for CEO Pichai, who made just over $6 million in 2021 and $7.4 million in 2020. The rest of the compensation besides the stock awards reportedly came from a $2 million base salary and more than $5 million for a private security detail in 2022.\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images News Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai received $226M in total compensation in 2022, including a $218M equity award via a triennial stock grant. Annual salary was $2M, with the CEO's compensation package also including almost $6M for personal security. Difficult time? The news comes as Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) initiates cost restructuring measures, including layoffs of 12,000 workers, or 6% of workforce. Pichai even said in January that top executives would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures. In December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Pichai with a value of $210M. In 2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his compensation was valued at $281M. Have a tip? Submit confidentially to our News team. Found a factual error?

The company also said that the board has recognised Pichai's \"strong performance\" as CEO and added that the vesting of a significant portion of the award would depend on Alphabet's total shareholder return relative to other S&P 100 companies. Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. said the award was tweaked to increase the performance stock units (PSUs) to 60 per cent from 43 per cent in 2019, while increasing the performance requirement for the payout. According to Reuters, Pichai, who is given an equity award every three years, was granted two tranches of PSUs with a target value of $63 million each and was also given a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet's restricted stock units. As per a filing from 2020, Google disclosed Pichai's annual salary to be at $2 million. According to the IIFL Hurun India Rich List 2022, Pichai's net worth fell 20 per cent to Rs 5,300 crore, but he ranks amongst the top ten richest professional managers on the list. Before that, in 2018, Pichai turned down a similar fresh grant of stock options, saying he was already paid \u201cgenerously\u201d.\nSundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and Google, was awarded compensation in 2022 valued at $226 million, according to a regulatory filing Friday, including stock awards valued at more than $200 million.    In 2019, the last year his compensation included a triannual stock grant, his compensation was valued at $281 million.    Mr. Pichai said in January that top executives would get lower bonuses as part of cost-cutting measures, following the largest round of layoffs in the company\u2019s history. Last month, Google\u2019s finance chief told employees to expect more spending cuts.    Mr. Pichai\u2019s annual salary for 2020-2022 was $2 million, Friday\u2019s filing shows.    In December, the company granted a new triannual equity award to Mr. Pichai with a value of $210 million, according to a regulatory filing, consisting of both performance-based and time-based equity.    That grant contains two tranches of performance stock units with a target value of $63 million each, plus a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet\u2019s restricted stock units. Alphabet said in the filing that more of the latest stock award would be dependent on performance over time, increasing the proportion of performance stock units to 60% of the total from 43% in 2019.

Jesse Green, the chief theater critic for The New York Times, described it as \u201ca performance of tremendous skill and improbable stamina.\u201d It was a remarkable win for the 30-year-old English actress, who is best known for playing the assassin Villanelle on the television show \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d She not only took home her first Tony Award on her first try; she won it for her first performance on a major stage. \u201cIt kind of felt unattainable,\u201d she told The Times in April of the prospect of doing theater. On Sunday night, Comer thanked Suzie Miller, the writer of \u201cPrima Facie,\u201d which won many awards in Australia and Britain.\nI mean, that's astonishing when you think about it.\" \"Prima Facie\" is a demanding, draining one-woman show. Comer is alone on the stage for more than an hour-and-a-half.  Moriarty asked Comer, \"This is your first time on Broadway, first time on a London stage \u2013 and you pick this play?\"  \"How do you not?\" Comer replied. \"I was like, 'I have no idea how I'm going to execute this or how I'm gonna get to a place of being confident and comfortable enough to do this, never mind, like, once, but, like, eight shows a week.' But I was so excited by that journey. Like, if I didn't take this, another actress is going to, and I'm gonna hate myself for the rest of my life!\" Comer had to research the part of a barrister, which is the British equivalent of an American trial lawyer. But she had no trouble playing a scrappy young woman from Liverpool (a blue-collar town north of London) who defies expectations. Liverpool is where Comer also grew up. \"I'm definitely scrappy,\" she laughed. \"Yeah, there's a lot of me in her, for sure.\" Comer said her parents and younger brother never doubted she'd succeed as a professional actor, even without formal training. \"They were just, like, if you're gonna commit, commit.\nBy\u00a0         Megan Lim       ,\u00a0         Courtney Dorning       ,\u00a0         Juana Summers       NPR's Juana Summers talks with actress Jodie Comer about the Broadway premiere of her play Prima Facie. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Jodie Comer - American audiences probably know her as Villanelle, the beautiful, chameleon-like assassin on \"Killing Eve\"...(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"KILLING EVE\")JODIE COMER: (As Villainelle) I did my first ever kill in this country here - strangled a high-ranking police officer. He was a tango champion.SUMMERS: ...Or as Millie and her avatar Molotov Girl in the movie \"Free Guy.\" Now Comer is also a Tony Award winner. She won best actress at last night's ceremony for \"Prima Facie.\" The one-woman show is in the final weeks of a Broadway run after selling out in London's West End last year. It is the story of Tessa, a lawyer who successfully represents men accused of sexual assault.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMER: (As Tessa) The only way the system works is because we all play our roles. My role is defense. The prosecutor prosecutes. We each tell a story, and the jury decide which story is the one they believe. They take the responsibility.\nAnd I think that actually, through this experience, I\u2019ve been able to transform that into a sense of trust, which is a really nice feeling,\u201d she said.\u00a0  \tThe Broadway production is lead produced by James Bierman of Empire Street Productions. Bierman noted the production was able to recoup while also offering lower-priced tickets, including $10 lottery tickets and $45 rush tickets throughout the run.  \t           \t\u201cBringing Prima Facie to Broadway has been a journey of responsibility and faith that has been met with a response that we only dared to dream of when we set out. Suzie Miller\u2019s urgent play, Justin Martin\u2019s forensic direction, and our design team\u2019s visceral production have been the backdrop for Jodie Comer\u2019s extraordinary performance as Tessa Ensler, and the way that audiences have embraced all of this has been truly humbling,\u201d Bierman said.\u00a0  \tA film adaptation of Prima Facie is in the works, with Cynthia Erivo set to star and executive produce.

In Prima Facie, written by Suzie Miller and directed by Justin Martin, Comer plays Tessa, a young, ambitious lawyer who defends individuals accused of sexual assault and then goes through the legal system herself as a victim of rape. While accepting her Tony Award on stage, Comer acknowledged the responsibility she feels in taking on the role.\u00a0  \t\u201cTo every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been the greatest honor and it continues to be,\u201d she said.  \tThe play marks Comer\u2019s Broadway debut. The Killing Eve actress played the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience.\u00a0  \t\u201cI feel like I have so much more trust within myself and who I am. I realized that I was quite fearful last year of a lot of things, especially in my ability to do this.\nQuestion:Who is the lead actress in Prima Facie?\nAnswer:"

He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. \u201cThere\u2019s some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting started on a term paper.\u201d Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting opportunity to connect with someone new. Additionally, the world is becoming more automated: Email messages auto-complete, subscription services auto-renew, and any product under the sun is a single click away.\nWe've officially entered a new circle of online dating hell. Meet Rizz, which according to its App Store profile is an AI-powered \"dating assistant\" that tells Tinder, Hinge, and otherwise dating app users what to say to their online matches. It connects directly to a user's keyboard for easy access, and once installed, all you really have to do is start swiping right \u2014 then, from there, just let the bot dictate your every word. Cool. We hate it here. \"There's some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message,\" Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor and Rizz user, told The Washington Post. \"It's like getting started on a term paper.\" And Rizz isn't the only app like this out there. As WaPo notes, a few other apps, including one called YourMove.ai, are currently on the market, while a number of dating app scoundrels have taken to the internet in recent months to tout the supposed dating app prowess of ChatGPT. \"This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,\" YourMove.ai founder Dmitri Mirakyan told WaPo. \"So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month later, I built the first version [of the platform].\nMirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social cues \u2014 a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. \"There's such a gap currently,\" he told the newspaper, \"in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across.\" That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims\u00a0\u2014 and as humans, maybe we should shoot a little higher.

That lack of personalization is part of what ultimately caused Lloyd, the investor, to lose faith in the AI dating tool. Throughout his experience using Rizz, the AI constructed a slew of strange and often outright false messages. \u201cYou can imagine a world where Tinder and Hinge have all your chats and offer up the type of thing you\u2019d say in a scenario that\u2019s authentic to your voice,\u201d he said. But in the meantime, \u201cit was hilariously bad, again and again.\u201d Ironically, there are two viral AI apps called Rizz. The one Lloyd used was founded by four college students: Charis Zhang, 20, Oliver Johansson, 20, Tobias Worledge, 19, all sophomores at the University of California at Berkeley, and Daniel He, 20, a sophomore at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe\u2019re all [computer science] majors who stay in our rooms all day coding,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThe reason we created this app is that we\u2019re experiencing the pain of not fully knowing how to converse with people.\n\u201d Green said she tweaked some suggested messages to show her own personality, but the AI brought out a side of her that she usually does not show. Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology\u2019s ability to foster deeper human connection. \u201cIt\u2019s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I\u2019m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.\u201d None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. \u201cIt\u2019s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember when people didn\u2019t want to share that they met on a dating app? That\u2019s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.\nQuestion:What is the name of the AI dating tool Coyne Lloyd used?\nAnswer:"

Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England\u2019s youth international teams for both men and women. \u201cI\u2019m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as sporting director,\u201d Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe immediate focus is supporting where I can the women\u2019s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand\u2026 Leading the search for the next men\u2019s coach is an opportunity I\u2019m excited about.\u201d Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women\u2019s national team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but \u201cwill immediately begin the process of hiring the head coach of the Men\u2019s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.\u201d Crocker\u2019s first, and arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men\u2019s national team head coach ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.\nU.S. Soccer plans to narrow the focus of its sporting director job as part of a slight but significant restructuring near the top of the federation. The role has been vacant since Earnie Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job \u2014 which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said \u2014 into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said. This will, in turn, allow the sporting director to work almost exclusively on the elite player pathway and the environments and structures surrounding U.S. Soccer's 27 national teams \u2014 from the USMNT and USWNT all the way on down to youth teams and what U.S.\nCHICAGO (April 25, 2023) \u2013 The U.S. Soccer Federation has appointed Matt Crocker as the next Sporting Director. The former English Football Association Head of Development Teams and Southampton Director of Football Operations brings more than 25 years of experience in player development and coaching with proven success at the club, youth, and senior international levels.\u00a0 \u00a0 As Sporting Director, Crocker will oversee U.S. Soccer\u2019s entire Sporting Department, focusing on the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s National Team programs, Youth National Teams, and the Extended National Teams. Crocker will be responsible for setting U.S. Soccer\u2019s sporting vision, overseeing the performance of all national teams, implementing the technical development plan, developing sporting culture, philosophy, ensuring greater communication, and sharing of best practices.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While he will start fulltime on August 2nd, Crocker will immediately begin the process of hiring the head coach of the Men\u2019s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski. He will officially start during the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDuring the interview process, we identified several key characteristics and experiences that set Matt apart,\u201d said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. \u201cHe is an experienced leader and has had success at the professional and National Team level. He is a great communicator and team builder.\nThe United States Soccer Federation is searching for a new sporting director to oversee its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams following the sudden and unexpected departure of Earnie Stewart, who had held the job since 2019. U.S. Soccer announced Thursday that Stewart will leave his post on Feb. 15 to take on a similar role with club side PSV Eindhoven in his native Netherlands.\u00a0 The USSF also confirmed reports by FOX Sports and others that men\u2019s national team general manager Brian McBride is out, too. The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride?\u00a0\u00a0 On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride\u2019s position might not be filled at all.\u00a0 \"We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men\u2019s] GM role,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to make.\" When it comes to Stewart\u2019s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.\nQuestion:Who is the new sporting director of U.S. Soccer?\nAnswer:"

In January 2022 it was revealed a feminist action comedy focusing on two British-Pakistani sisters was being filmed in London by Nida Manzoor with Working Title, Focus Features and Parkville Pictures, with a tone and voice similar to Manzoor\u2019s breakthrough and BAFTA, Peabody, and Rose d'Or award winning sitcom series We Are Lady Parts.[5]  In February 2022 it was announced that filming had wrapped on the project in London. It is produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner for Working Title with Olivier Kaempfer and John Pocock for Parkville Pictures. Focus Features had distribution rights.[2][6][7]  The typography & graphic design for the title card, credits, chapter headings and fight sequence introductions was designed by Peter Anderson Studio.[8]  Polite Society was released at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2023,[9] at the 2023 Glasgow Film Festival on 12 March 2023,[10] and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 April 2023.[11][12]\nShe\u2019s from the indie cinema space, and we wanted that. I wanted her to stay true to herself as a DP. She loves to go handheld. She loves it to feel a little bit bursting at the seams. There\u2019s a wildness and a freedom to the way she shoots. It was just a thrill to get to work with her. Prepping with Ashley is the most fun ever; we just swap film references, watch lots of films, and constantly remind each other of the films that are inspiring us as we shoot. We\u2019re like, \u201c70\u2019s Scorsese! It can be a bit out of focus.\u201d We were looking at Park Chan-wook\u2019s movies, his Vengeance Trilogy being both stylized but also fizzing. It\u2019s not overly stylized, there\u2019s a vibrancy of movement within the frame, and we wanted to bring that to it. It was just constantly back and forth, sharing references, and having a really great time. \u00a0 Polite Society\u00a0is playing in theaters nationwide.\nPolite Society is a 2023 British action comedy-drama film written and directed by Nida Manzoor (in her feature film directorial debut). The film stars Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya, Nimra Bucha, Akshay Khanna, Seraphina Beh, Ella Bruccoleri, Shona Babayemi, Shobu Kapoor, and Jeff Mirza.  Polite Society had its world premiere at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2023, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 April 2023 by Focus Features. The film received favourable reviews from critics.  In London, British-Pakistani teenager Ria Khan aspires to become a movie stuntwoman like her idol, Eunice Huthart. Under an alter-ego, \"The Fury\", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams.   At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more \"serious\" career. Ria's emails to Eunice about a potential mentorship go unanswered, and she is soundly defeated by the school bully Kovacs.\nManzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. \"It made me believe that our stories are worth being told,\" Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almod\u00f3var. \"He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\" Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. \"Each of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I gravitate to,\" she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane Austen's works have always resonated with her. \"There's something in the way she explores the pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own,\" she says.\u00a0 Polite Society is in theaters now.\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter A Letter From Filmmaker Nida Manzoor About Polite Society\u00a0 The writer-director offers an inside look at her new action-comedy Sundance feature Share on Facebook Share on Twitter This started for me about 10 years ago when I had the idea to make the film. I wrote the first draft when I was in my early 20s, and I was just trying to get it made. It was only in the last couple years that we've found the right partners to make it with.

Actor Priya Kansara and director Nida Manzoor on the set of Polite Society. I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience.\nQuestion:Who is the director of \"Polite Society\"?\nAnswer:"

This followed a comprehensive bid evaluation, conducted by the IWGA CEO Joachim Gossow, and Vice President Max Bishop,\u00a0 including an on-site visit in March 2019. .  The delegates were given a first impression of the city and what it can offer as host of a multi-sport event by the delegation of the future host with an impressive presentation. Chengdu, a city with 20 million inhabitants and the capital of Sichuan province, is organising several multi-sports events, such as the World Police and Fire Games,\u00a0 and FISU Summer Universiade, in the next few years. \u00a0The World Games is a multi-sport event staged every four years by the International World Games Association under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee. The 11th edition of The World Games will be held in Birmingham, Alabama, USA, 15-25 July 2021. 3,600 athletes from over 30 sports and 100 countries will take part in the Games.\nThe Chinese city of Chengdu will be the host city for The World Games 2025. On Thursday 9 May, in Gold Coast, Australia, the Mayor of Chengdu, Mr Luo Qiang, signed the Organiser Agreement for the 12th edition of the multi-sports event.  The Vice President of IOC and the Chinese Olympic Committee, Mr Yu Zaiqing, signed the agreement as Witness. President Jose Perurena\u00a0 signed on behalf of the International World Games Association. This was preceded by ratification of the contract by the 37 member federations of the IWGA during the Annual General Meeting at the SportAccord Convention in Gold Coast. Chengdu follows the city of Birmingham, Alabama as host. The 11th edition of The World Games will take place there from 15 to 25 July 2021.  Jose Perurena said at a press briefing afterwards: \u201cBy signing a contract with one of the most forward-looking and dynamic cities in China, we have signalled our arrival as a major power in international sport.\u201d The IWGA President added: \u201dFollowing our 2021 event in another great country, the USA, we are excited now to start work with our Chinese partners on plans for 2025.\u201d  Chengdu Mayor, Mr Luo Qiang, said: \"Chengdu highly appreciates the concept of the IWGA and believe that it is in line with Chengdu's development philosophy.\nFor example, the Bullfight Ring, which was the venue for dancesport, was 'packed' for the salsa dance finals.[16]  This edition of the Games saw the first time a competition was cancelled: due to concerns about temperature and air flow at the Del Pueblo Gymnasium, where the sport of rhythmic gymnastics was taking place, the ribbons event was cancelled.[17]  The 2017 Games in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland were the first to be broadcast on the Olympic Channel, to 130 countries. Both the raffa and lyonnaise disciplines of boules were cancelled after a storm destroyed the venue and it could not be repaired in time.[18]  In 2015, it was announced that the 11th edition of The World Games was to be held in Birmingham, Alabama, USA in 2021, beating bids from Lima, Peru and Ufa, Russia.[19] On 2 April 2020, the Games were postponed to 2022 so as not to clash with the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo due to the coronavirus pandemic.[20][21][22]  No parasport federations are currently part of the IWGA, but The World Games in Birmingham was the first edition to include parasports, with the inclusion of wheelchair rugby. Birmingham was also to include disabled athletes (one per gender) in archery.\n23] The IWGA is also aiming to secure a partnership with the International Paralympic Committee and include a quota for para-athletes.[1]:\u200a1\u200a  In 2019, it was announced that The World Games in 2025 will take place in Chengdu, China.[24]  In order for hosting to be sustainable, organisers of The World Games are not required to build any new venues or facilities.[1]:\u200a9\u200a For example, Sloss Furnaces, a former pig iron-producing blast furnace now in public use, hosted the sport climbing, breakdancing, parkour and beach handball competitions in Birmingham 2022.[25] Athletes stayed at the student accommodations of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), several of whose sports facilities were used for various events.[23]  Past venues have included the Lahti City Theatre (bodybuilding), Landschaftspark Nord (a former iron foundry in Duisburg), Wroc\u0142aw Zoo, and Wroc\u0142aw's Philharmonic Hall, the National Forum of Music.[10][15][26]  Even though it is not required, some venues are constructed or renovated for The World Games. For instance, for the 2017 World Games in Wroc\u0142aw, a new swimming pool and speed skating rink were built, and Olympic Stadium, built in 1928, was renovated and is still used for American football and speedway.\nAfter months of anticipation and years of preparation, we finally have our 16 host cities and venues for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The major takeaways: 11 U.S. cities were selected from the candidate pool, with three cities in Mexico and two Canadian cities joining the fray as well. The List: United States: New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Seattle, San Francisco/Bay Area and Los Angeles Canada: Vancouver, Toronto Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey The tournament was awarded to the North American and CONCACAF rivals four years ago, fending off a strong bid from Morocco, and will be a notable competition for several reasons. It will be the first World Cup hosted by more than one nation since 2002, when Japan and South Korea shared the honors, and it'll be the first World Cup with three hosts. Mexico will make history as the first nation to host or co-host for a third time (following 1970 and 1986), the U.S. will be second-time hosts (following 1994), and it will be Canada's first time hosting the men's tournament, having been the site of the Women's World Cup in 2015.\nQuestion:Which city will host The World Games 2025?\nAnswer:"

With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch. Google's first foldable has arrived with a wider aspect ratio \u2014 inside and out \u2014 as well as the Tensor G2's AI finesse to help squeeze every pixel out of the cameras and every iota of productivity out of your day.

Google Pixel Fold is now available for pre-order and will begin shipping next month. Our new foldable phone combines the helpfulness of Pixel with a design that unfolds into a compact tablet, unlocking even more ways for you to use your device. And it\u2019s all powered by our Google Tensor G2 chip, which also makes Pixel Fold fast and secure. Here\u2019s a look at the newest addition to our Pixel portfolio. When closed, Pixel Fold has a familiar smartphone silhouette that fits in the palm of your hand and slides into your pocket. Flip it open to reveal a 7.6-inch screen with a thinner profile than any other foldable phone in the market.1 To create this foldable design, we didn\u2019t compromise on form and function. Many of the Pixel components \u2014 from camera, battery, speakers and haptics technology \u2014 were cleverly redesigned to fit within the thin design. Our custom-built hinge not only contributes to that thinness, but also doubles as the most durable hinge out there.2 And last but not least, Pixel Fold has an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Whether it\u2019s open or closed, the Pixel Fold\u2019s screens unlock endless ways of having fun and getting things done.\nBy  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn\u2019t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn\u2019t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we\u2019ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It\u2019ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have \u201cthe most durable hinge on a foldable,\u201d along with a price that\u2019s over $1,700. Samsung\u2019s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799. We had expected to see it last year, but the Fold didn\u2019t make the cut for I/O in 2022, and rumors about its launch haven\u2019t slowed down in the year since.\nThe Pixel Fold is available for pre-order from today (May 10), with general sales in June. Incredibly, as of late May, the top 512GB Pixel Fold model is already sold out in the US. If you pre-order the Pixel Fold, Google will also toss in a free Pixel Watch, although this promotion is limited to Germany, the UK, and the US (leaving Japan in the lurch). Otherwise, everyone also gets a 2TB Google One plan for six months and a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium. There\u2019s also a trade-in program for those who want to switch their current handset for the foldable. Google accepts products from Apple, LG, Motorola, OnePlus, and Samsung, and the trade-in\u2019s value differs between the various models. Notably, you can also trade in Google Pixels. For instance, the 128GB Pixel 7 Pro will get you $380 off the Fold\u2019s price. Visit Google\u2019s trade-in portal for the full list of products and offers. The Pixel Fold hasn\u2019t made its mass market debut yet, so you won\u2019t find expert reviews of the foldable. However, based on our experience with the device at Google I/O 2023, the Pixel Fold should do more than enough to challenge the likes of Samsung in this space. In his hands-on preview, C. Scott Brown \u201ccame away impressed\u201d by the Pixel Fold. \u201cIt felt great. It looked great.\nGoogle has focused on teaching Android developers to make their apps work on foldable devices and larger screens, which may pay off next week with the launch of this device and the new Pixel Tablet.

Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its\u00a02022 flagship phone\u2019s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.\u00a0 The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google\u2019s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung\u2019s latest\u00a0Galaxy Z Fold 4\u00a0and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables \u2014 with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC \u2014 having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.\nWhat it is: Google\u2019s first smartphone that folds in half, arriving next month How much does it cost? $1,799 to start What does it promise? A great camera and a design that means it\u2019s easier to use (or tuck into a pocket) when closed More than a quarter of smartphone owners in the United States are \u201chighly likely\u201d to upgrade to a foldable model next, according to a survey conducted by Counterpoint Research. That leaves Google \u2014 long an also-ran in the U.S. smartphone market \u2014 with an opportunity. And thankfully, the company\u2019s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn\u2019t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it\u2019s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Pixel Fold is noticeably thinner than other Samsung options, either. At last: a folding smartphone that won\u2019t feel super awkward in your back pocket. When open, the Fold\u2019s internal 7.\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For many watching Google's I/O developer conference this week, the big draw is a full breakdown of the company's broader AI plans. But the company hasn\u2019t just been working on software. During the conference\u2019s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets \u2014 including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display \u2014 as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren\u2019t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It\u2019s not clear what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company\u2019s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here\u2019s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.\nChecking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  In this article Google will launch its first foldable smartphone sometime in June, challenging Samsung's market-leading foldable phone business, according to internal communications viewed by CNBC. It plans to announce the device at its annual developer conference, Google I/O, on May 10. The Pixel Fold, known internally by the codename \"Felix,\" will have the \"most durable hinge on a foldable\" phone, according to the documents. It will cost upward of $1,700 and compete with Samsung's $1,799 Galaxy Z Fold 4. Google plans to market the Pixel Fold as water-resistant and pocket-sized, with an outside screen that measures 5.8 inches across, according to the documents.\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?\nAnswer:"

The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, down from 3.5 percent in March, and matched the level in January, which was the lowest since 1969. The higher-than-forecast job gain complicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential shift toward a pause in interest rate increases. Chair Jerome H.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 253,000 for the month, beating Wall Street estimates for growth of 180,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate was 3.4% against an estimate for 3.6% and tied for the lowest level since 1969. A more encompassing number that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged lower to 6.6%. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation barometer, rose 0.5% for the month, more than the 0.3% estimate and the biggest monthly gain in a year.\nBLS\u00a0Revisions: The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised down by 32,000, from +504,000 to +472,000, and the change for February was revised up by 15,000, from +311,000 to +326,000. With these revisions, employment in January and February combined is 17,000 lower than previously reported. The change in temporary help services employment in January was revised up from gain of +15,300 jobs to a gain of +16,600, and the previously estimated gain of +6,800 in February was revised down to a gain of +3,400. With these revisions, temporary help services employment in February was -2,100 lower than previously reported.

This marks the twelfth consecutive month that nonfarm payroll growth has outpaced expectations per the Bloomberg survey. This continues a decelerating trend. In 2022, average monthly payroll growth was +399,000; three months into 2023, that figure is +345,000, with March\u2019s payroll growth half of January\u2019s revised figure.

As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic \u2013 with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency\u2019s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice.\u00a0The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to protect the nation\u2019s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain available.

The PHE has been in place since January 27, 2020, and renewed throughout the pandemic. The latest HHS extension for the PHE is effective through January 11, 2023. In a letter to the state Governors, the Administration has indicated they will give at least a 60-day notice before the PHE ends. In April, ASHA urged HHS to extend the PHE in a letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra [PDF]. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-103) provides a 151-day extension to some flexibilities, once the federal PHE ends. With this PHE renewal and the additional 151-day extension, ASHA expects certain flexibilities will continue at least into the second quarter of 2023, such as continued payment for audiology and speech-language pathology telehealth services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. With each PHE extension, numerous flexibilities and waivers remain in effect, including Medicare telehealth coverage of audiology and speech-language pathology services and relaxed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.

Microsoft is announcing a new AI-powered Copilot for its Microsoft 365 apps and services today, designed to assist people with generating documents, emails, presentations, and much more. The Copilot, powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft\u2019s Copilot leaked earlier today. \u201cIt works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more,\u201d said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. \u201cCopilot is a whole new way of working.\u201d Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can also be summoned throughout Microsoft\u2019s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.\nThe Office Assistant is a discontinued intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character which interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1][2][3][4] (sometimes later called \"Clippy\"), after a paperclip. Clippit was the default, and by far the most notable, Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[5] The Office Assistant and particularly Clippit have been the subject of numerous criticism and parodies. In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip emoji (\ud83d\udcce) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.[6]  The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office. It assisted users by way of an interactive animated character that interfaced with the Office help content.\nIf you ask Word to create a document based on your data, Copilot will send that prompt to the Microsoft Graph to retrieve the context and data before modifying the prompt and sending it to the GPT-4 large language model. The response then gets sent to the Microsoft Graph for additional grounding, security and compliance checks, before sending the response and commands back to Microsoft 365 apps. Microsoft is also planning to launch a Business Chat feature that works across all Microsoft 365 data and apps. It uses the Microsoft Graph to bring together documents, presentations, emails, notes, and contacts into a single chat interface in Microsoft Teams that can generate summaries, planning overviews, and more. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled this new AI Copilot during a special AI productivity event this morning. After bringing an AI-powered chatbot to Bing recently, Microsoft is moving quickly toward the integration of OpenAI\u2019s large language models into its Microsoft 365 suite. Microsoft\u2019s announcement comes just days after Google announced similar AI features for Google Workspace, including AI-assisted text generation in Gmail, Docs, and more. Microsoft says it\u2019s testing its Microsoft 365 Copilot with 20 customers right now and will be expanding the preview in the coming months. \u201cWe will share more about pricing and details in the coming months,\u201d says Microsoft in a blog post today.\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot enabled access for a select group of customers to demonstrate what the new AI office assistant can do. Soon you could use it too! The Copilot writes content based on a few prompts to make your job easier. For example, ask for suggestions for your next meeting on Word and Copilot would list a few ideas.    The new MS tool becomes part of every Microsoft 365 app you use every day: Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, Teams and others.

More on AI for work from @CNNBusiness: https://t.co/VF6yWng8YE  Microsoft 365 Copilot adds the power of generative AI to your online workplace. For example, it would allow MS Word to write, edit and summarize your text. Meanwhile, you can use Copilot in PowerPoint to turn ideas into a designed presentation. For example, ask for a slide show related to AI assistants and it will create corresponding slides. It adds text descriptions and creates custom designs based on your topic. Excel with Copilot can also analyze data, identify trends and create data visualizations within minutes. Microsoft 365 Copilot manages your Outlook Inbox so you spend more time communicating with customers and colleagues. The AI tool improves meetings by providing \u201creal-time summaries and action items\u201d in the context of conversations.\nIt was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004).

Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in System32 folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout & Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0.

One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.\nText-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google\u2019s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google\u2019s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google\u2019s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren\u2019t satisfied with the result, you\u2019re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn\u2019t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren\u2019t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.\nThe company markets the tool as a way to \u201cmake complex edits without pro-level editing tools,\u201d allowing you to leverage the power of AI to single out and transform a portion of your photo. That includes the ability to enhance the sky, move and scale subjects, as well as remove parts of an image with just a few taps. Google\u2019s Magic Editor attempts to package all the steps that it would take to make similar edits in a program like Photoshop into a single tap \u2014 or, at least, that\u2019s what it looks like from the demo. In Photoshop, for example, you\u2019re stuck using the Content-Aware Move tool (or any of the other methods of your choice) to pick up and move a subject inside of an image. Even then, the photo still might not look quite right, which means you\u2019ll have to pick up other tools, like the Clone Stamp tool or maybe even the Spot Healing Brush, to fix any leftover artifacts or a mismatched background. It\u2019s not the most complicated process ever, but as with most professional creative tools, there\u2019s a definite learning curve for people who are new to the program. I\u2019m all for Google making photo editing tools free and more accessible, given that Photoshop and some of the other image editing apps out there are expensive and pretty unintuitive. But putting powerful and incredibly easy-to-use image editing tools into the hands of, well, just about everyone who downloads Google Photos could transform the way we edit \u2014 and look at \u2014 photos.\nIn addition to new smart devices, Google teased a new AI-enhanced Magic Editor tool at this year\u2019s annual I/O conference. Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.\nMasked region and Imagen Editor\u2019s results for \u201ca bouquet of red flowers,\u201d \u201ctwo trees,\u201d \u201can Imagen Editor sign,\u201d \u201ca bush with green leaves,\u201d and \u201ca bush without leaves\u201d Technically called inpainting, the process Google\u2019s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop\u2019s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?\nAnswer:"

The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask\u2014including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses\u2014necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.\nWhere a user looks stays private while navigating Apple Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. Additionally, data from the camera and other sensors is processed at the system level, so individual apps do not need to see a user\u2019s surroundings to enable spatial experiences. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video. Pricing and Availability Apple Vision Pro starts at $3,499 (U.S.), and will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple Store locations in the U.S., with more countries coming later next year. Customers will be able to learn about, experience, and personalize their fit for Vision Pro at Apple Store locations. For more information about Vision Pro, visit apple.com/apple-vision-pro.

Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.\nApple is already working on a new version of the Apple Vision Pro that will be priced more affordably. Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone. Apple is expected to offer a more affordable model and a follow up to the higher-end and more expensive first-generation model. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \"contact lenses\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s.\nBy  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that \u201cseamlessly\u201d blends the real and digital world. \u201cIt\u2019s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says \u201chundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps\u201d will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they\u2019re resting low on your body.\nQuestion:What is the price of the Apple Vision Pro headset?\nAnswer:"

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.\nVision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.\nApple is working on at least three augmented-reality and virtual-reality headset devices, the first of which will likely launch with the name \"Apple Reality Pro,\" according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian ZelboIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, Gurman explained that there are a minimum of three Apple headsets actively in development that he is aware of, under the codes \"N301,\" \"N602,\" and \"N421.\" The first of these devices, N301, is what Gurman believes will be called \"Apple Reality Pro.\" Apple Reality Pro is said to be the company's \"high-end rival\" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the \"Reality Pro\" name lines up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including \"Reality Processor,\" \"Reality Pro,\" and \"Reality One.\nSubscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.\nQuestion:What is the name of Apple's headset?\nAnswer:"

So I founded Maven in 2014 because I saw firsthand a lot of the gaps in the in the women\u2019s and family health care model. And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren\u2019t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we\u2019re also the richest country that spends the most on health care. And so you know, what Maven does is we really fill in all of these very distinct gaps through a virtual care and financial support platform. So we have the largest telehealth network and women\u2019s and family health.\nPast fundraising rounds attracted successful American women including\u00a0Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Natalie Portman, and Reese Witherspoon. Sign up\u00a0for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders. Ryder has said in the past that her determination to create Maven\u00a0came partially as a result of her own medical frustration and trauma. A miscarriage left her feeling \"lost, discouraged, and confused why something so painful and physically taxing was considered outside the bounds of traditional healthcare,\" she wrote in a blog post. With the new funding, Ryder said the company needs to be careful about how it scales, but will not be conservative with the cash despite the current economic environment given the need to invest in growth opportunities. \"We're not putting this capital aside for a rainy day,\" she wrote on Monday. Global family benefits growth and Medicaid are two areas that Maven is prioritizing with the new funding. The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform. Additional Medicaid expansion requires \"a more localized approach, which must be more deliberate,\" Ryder said, \"but particularly in the aftermath of Roe, the need has never been greater.\" The Maven CEO laid out some more of her strategic thinking after the fundraise in a series of Twitter posts.

Maven reached unicorn status last August in a $110 million round right before the bottom dropped out of the tech sector. While the downturn in tech is forcing down rounds for some startups, Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder said in a blog post the latest deal raised its valuation, albeit slightly, to $1.35 billion.

The American, boasting just one prior win on the PGA Tour and having never previously made the cut at the tournament, held off the challenge of Northern Ireland\u2019s four-time major champion to win the 123rd edition of the major by a single stroke.           Clark, 29, carded a closing round even-par 70 to finish 10-under overall and earn a $3.6 million winner\u2019s cut of a record $20 million prize purse, the largest ever awarded in major history.           And while the win fell on Father\u2019s Day, Clark dedicated the win to his mother, Lise Clark, who died of breast cancer in 2013.     'I wish you could be here, Mom': Wyndham Clark channels late mother's instruction as he surges into US Open contention         The Denver-born golfer had spoken at length about her inspiration earlier in the tournament, explaining how she had left him with the instruction to \u201cplay big.\u201d Mission emphatically accomplished, Clark teared up while discussing her in his winner\u2019s interview.           \u201cI just felt like my mom was watching over me today and you know she can\u2019t be here. Miss you mom,\u201d said an emotional Clark.\nThe 2023 United States Open Championship was the 123rd U.S. Open, the national open golf championship of the United States. It was a 72-hole stroke play played from June 15\u201318 on the North Course of Los Angeles Country Club in Los Angeles, California. It was the first U.S. Open to be played in Los Angeles since Riviera Country Club hosted the tournament in 1948.[1]  Wyndham Clark, who had never finished better than 75th in a major championship and had missed the cut in his previous two U.S. Opens, shot a final-round 70 to finish at 10-under-par for the tournament and hold off four-time major champion Rory McIlroy by one shot for his first career U.S. Open and major championship .[2]  Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele both broke the U.S. Open scoring record by shooting 62 (\u22128) in the first round. Fowler, who was tied with Clark for the lead at the start of the final round, ended up tied for fifth place, while Schauffele finished 10th.[3]  On July 22, 2015, the United States Golf Association (USGA) announced that Los Angeles Country Club was selected to host the 123rd U.S. Open in June 2023.

(AP Photo/Matt York) LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 In the city of stars, Wyndham Clark had his own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf\u2019s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother \u2014 \u201cPlay big,\u201d she always told him \u2014 and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That\u2019s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. \u201cI feel like I belong on this stage,\u201d Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. \u201cEven two, three years ago when people didn\u2019t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.\nTiger Woods will miss the tournament after undergoing ankle surgery following his withdrawal from the Masters in April.

The event typically falls around the time of its July 12 birthday, with the exception of Prime Day 2020, which was held in October. Prime Day takes place in the summer, and it almost always begins on a Tuesday and wraps up in the early hours on Thursday.   Amazon Prime Day is a two-day sale that features thousands of deals that are exclusively available for Amazon Prime members. The 48-hour event is a way for Amazon to reward its subscribers with special savings. Some of the markdowns will come with discounts that match or beat Black Friday offers, and there will be Amazon-exclusive products and deals that shoppers won\u2019t find at other stores. And beyond deals on products, the online store often has deals on its Kindle subscriptions, streaming channels, and more.\u00a0   And while the celebration focuses on the impressive savings for Prime subscribers, there will be deals available for all shoppers \u2014\u00a0even non-members.

Now we do not yet have confirmation that Amazon will have another Early Access Sale this year. But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale \u2014 and there's no reason to think it won't \u2014 you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon\u2019s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers.

Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic.

Cooper Kupp was named Super Bowl LVI Most Valuable Player on Sunday following the Los Angeles Rams' comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Kupp caught the game-winning touchdown pass, a reception from one yard out with 1:25 remaining in regulation to give the Rams a 23-20 lead over the Bengals after a wild sequence in which an earlier Kupp touchdown was wiped out by penalty.

The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80\u00a0percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20\u00a0percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy.\n7] The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVII held on February 12, 2023, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.  Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players\u2014Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes\u2014have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]\nQuestion:Who was the MVP of Super Bowl 2022?\nAnswer:"
