                "value": "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.\u00a0 RELATED:\u00a010 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey\u2019s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam\u2019s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed \u201cdysfunctional family dramas\u201d.  ABC's\u00a0The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a\u00a0brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore\u2019s committed performance\u00a0as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.\u00a0 Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor\u2019s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.\nEdwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.\nSam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos), who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity?                     Suggest an update.        A scene with a major character being shot. Scenes of heart surgery. A scene with a patient who was punched by his wife for cheating.  Did you know you can flag iffy content?

Adjust limits for Language in your kid's entertainment guide.       Parents need to know that Good Sam is a medical procedural featuring a father-and-daughter heart surgeon team who hash out their familial drama as they save patients. Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as conversations about a near-fatal car accident, \"coding\" (needing to be resuscitated), and other medical lingo.\nInspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai\u00a0reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children\u2019s actions. RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.\nAt the nurses station, nurses DONNA (50s) and PAMELA (30s) are explaining to a patient how it crazy it can get here sometimes, just as SAMANTHA aka DR SAM (35) chases after MR FERGUSON, a disoriented patient who's refusing to be operated on. At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.\nQuestion:The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?\nAnswer:"

Sponsored by Vrbo, a vacation rental marketplace owned by the HomeAway division of Expedia, the game was officially known as the VRBO Citrus Bowl.  In the first meeting between the two programs, the game featured the Kentucky Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference. Both teams received and accepted invitations on Sunday, December 5.[5]  The Wildcats entered the Citrus Bowl with a 9\u20133 record (5\u20133 SEC) and a No. 22 ranking in the final CFP poll. Kentucky made its second Citrus Bowl appearance (2019).  The Hawkeyes, winners of the Big Ten West Division, entered the Citrus Bowl with a 10\u20133 record (7\u20132 B1G) and a No. 15 ranking in the final CFP poll.

LSU finishes the season with a 10-4 record. KEY PERFORMANCES Quarterback Jayden Daniels finished 12-of-17 for 139 yards and a touchdown. Redshirt freshman Garrett Nussmeier went 10-of-14 for 98 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Sophomore wideout Malik Nabers\u00a0earned Citrus Bowl MVP, leading the receivers with nine catches for 163 yards and a touchdown. Freshman tight end Mason Taylor recorded five catches for 88 yards and a touchdown. Senior safety Greg Brooks shined on defense with five tackles, one for loss, along with an interception. KEY PLAYS Purdue won the toss and deferred to the second half.\u00a0 On 1st-and-10 from the LSU 44, Daniels found Taylor for a 19-yard completion to the Purdue 44. On 4th-and-2 from the 36, the Tigers elected to go for it, and Daniels connected with Nabers for a 12-yard pickup to move the chains at the Boilermaker 24. Daniels then found Nabers again for a 9-yard gain down to the Purdue 15.\nWith college football's bowl season in full swing, the week between Christmas and New Year's felt like the right time to praise those who have played well this postseason and note the disappointing performances of others. Here are the winners and losers of the 2022-23 bowl season \u2014 so far. This post will be updated as bowl season continues through Jan. 2. LSU: The Tigers got to 10 wins in Brian Kelly\u2019s first season with an easy 63-7 win over Purdue on Jan. 2. The Tigers led 35-0 at halftime and were up 49-0 before Purdue finally got into the end zone. The Boilermakers entered the game without QB Aidan O\u2019Connell, WR Charlie Jones and a host of other players, but this was a bigger blowout than anyone could have anticipated. LSU was able to play three quarterbacks and WR Malik Nabers even threw two passes \u2014 one went for a TD \u2014 in addition to having nine catches for 163 yards and a TD. LSU came up just six yards short of hitting the 600-yard mark on offense and even got a 99-yard pick six with less than a minute left. Simply put, it was a blowout. Oregon State: Oregon State destroyed Florida 30-3 in the Las Vegas Bowl to get to 10 wins for the first time since 2006. Additionally, it was the first bowl win for the Beavers since 2013.\nGame summary of the Iowa Hawkeyes vs. Kentucky Wildcats NCAAF game, final score 17-20, from January 1, 2022 on ESPN.\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Citrus Bowl?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "A hugely successful high school quarterback, he threw for over 5,300 yards and 59 touchdowns at North Florida Christian High School before spending the early part of his college career at FSU. However, it was at West Virginia where his playing career took off, leading the Big 12 in completion percentage in 2014 while becoming a semifinalist for the Davey O\u2019Brien Award. A new addition to the Marshall coaching staff for the 2023 college football season, Jason Semore becomes the Thundering Herd\u2019s defensive coordinator. He arrives in Huntington having spent the last season with Georgia Tech, the latest stop on a varied and successful coaching career that has seen him gain experience in multiple roles at several different levels of competition. A linebacker at Adams State from 2001-2005, Semore spent 2022 working with the Georgia Tech linebackers and was slated to become their special teams coordinator with responsibilities for nickel backs and safeties. Instead, he reprises a role he previously held at Valdosta State, Montana, and the Colorado School of Mines, in addition to co-DC duties at his alma mater. He has tasted success in each of those stints. Semore helped lead Colorado School of Mines to a 10-2 season, assisted Montana in achieving three consecutive winning seasons and top-ranked Big Sky defense, and his defense fueled a Valdosta State run to the DII title game in 2021.\n\u201cMy preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,\u201d Semore said. \u201cDefense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it\u2019s based on effort and technique.\u201d He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. \u201cMy father was my inspiration,\u201d Jason said. \u201cHe taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.\nHe has coached at several schools throughout the southeast and is sure to have made plenty of recruiting connections.  He also previously worked with Geoff Collins during his second stint at Mississippi State. While together in Starkvegas, the two produced a defensive front that ranked No. 2 in the SEC in sacks in 2014 (37) and No. 4 in the SEC in rushing defense in 2013 (144.2 ypg). At Florida, the numbers get even better. His defensive front ranked in the top two in the SEC and top 25 nationally in sacks in both 2019 and 2020. In addition to some pretty good numbers, he has also coached some pretty impressive players that ended up in the NFL (Fletcher Cox, Patricker Kerney, and Myles Garrett, to name a few). Semore joins Georgia Tech for the second time in his career, after spending a year away at Valdosta State. He takes over the linebackers from Defensive Coordinator Andrew Thacker.\nJason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. \u2014 He\u2019s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he\u2019s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There\u2019s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that\u2019s not the focus of Jason Semore. \u201cI played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,\u201d said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets\u2019 football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \u201cMy first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.\u201d Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.\nby Andy Demetra (The Voice of the Yellow Jackets) Inside The Chart On The Map: The upbringing that makes newly minted special teams coordinator Jason Semore unlike almost any coach in Division I football You\u2019ve read this story before. Kid grows up a small-town coach\u2019s son. Follows his dad into the business.\u00a0 Grinds his way up the coaching ladder, establishing his own success. That doesn\u2019t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches\u2019 sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets\u2019 special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana. But Semore\u2019s background makes him unlike any coach\u2019s son at the Division I level. Maybe any coach in Division I, period. And the answer lies innocuously at the top of his bio. Hometown: Ganado, Ariz. It\u2019s an easy piece of information to gloss over, or skim past, or remain incurious about. Every coach and player has it listed obligatorily on their roster page.\nQuestion:What position did Jason Semore hold at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech?\nAnswer:"

In 2021, we delivered over 936,000 vehicles. Thank you to all of our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great year. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *************** Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q4 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company\u2019s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles. Investor Relations Contact: ir@tesla.\nThe EV maker doesn't disclose U.S.-only sales figures but claims sales for the year were up an amazing 87 percent in a turbulent marketplace. Anyone who thinks the legacy automakers are catching Tesla in the electric-vehicle sales race should take a quick look at some recently released figures. Over the weekend, Tesla announced it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021. Model S and Model X EVs made up 11,750 of those deliveries, while the bulk\u2014296,850\u2014were Model 3 and Model Y deliveries. These numbers brought Tesla's 2021 full-year deliveries to 936,172 vehicles. The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and other news sources noted,  based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600 deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier. Reuters reportssemiconductor chipsTesla doesn't break out its deliveries by country, but its sales are strongest in Europe and China, the  notes. Tesla itself called those two regions \"important markets\" in its last SEC filing, but the U.S. is still the region where Tesla makes the most money. In the third quarter of 2021, for example, an  shows Tesla made more than $6 billion in revenue in the U.S., compared to $3.\nMicrochip shortage? What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There\u2019s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent. Shopicar.\nAnalysts predict that Tesla\u2019s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company\u2019s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles: \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year\u2026 Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we\u2019ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,\u201d Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla\u2019s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has produced 3,429,532 cars.\n31, 2022, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 427,000 for the final quarter of the year. Estimates updated in December, and included in the FactSet consensus, ranged from 409,000 to 433,000. Those more recent estimates were in line with a company-compiled consensus distributed by Tesla investor relations Vice President Martin Viecha. That consensus, published by electric vehicle industry researcher @TroyTeslike, said that 24 sell-side analysts expected Tesla deliveries of about 417,957 on average for the quarter (and about 1.33 million deliveries for the full year). Tesla started production at two new factories this year \u2014 in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany \u2014 and ramped up production in Fremont, California, and in Shanghai, but it does not disclose production and delivery numbers by region.

Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held. Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14. NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the \"Sunday Night Football\" crew will presumably broadcast the event.

The new Allegient Stadium in Las Vegas, home to the relocated Raiders, also opened in 2020 but is not scheduled to host the Super Bowl until 2024, meaning another relatively old stadium has leaped in to fill the gap.

During that time, weekly visits to truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104]  Upon its launch, the British automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its \"T\" logo.[105]  The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post described it as \"a disaster\".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107]  The Truth Social platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the platform's growth.[108][109]\nDonald Trump's much-anticipated social media platform, called Truth Social, has debuted on iOS. And here's what you need to know about it. Former US President Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform, called Truth Social, is now available to download on iOS. So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President\u2019s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump\u2019s social network about anyway? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.\nWith the Android app still unavailable, not a lot has actually changed since Truth Social launched on iPhone. However, there's a workaround. The Truth Social app is still not available to download on Android devices, although it is expected to arrive at some point in the near future. Truth Social is a much newer social media network compared to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, and it is one that promises to offer an open platform that doesn\u2019t discriminate against users based on their political ideology. In fact, this political ideology promise is exactly why Truth Social came to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn\u2019t censor its users was advertised as in the works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on iPhone. At the time, Android support was understood to be coming, but there's was\u00a0no clear indication of when. Related:\u00a0Trump's Truth Social Posts On Other Platforms Delay, Explained In terms of Android support, not a lot has actually changed since then, and it remains unknown when Truth Social will be available to download from the Google Play Store. Comments last month from the Truth Social CEO confirmed the app was still en route, explaining that it was waiting on approval from Google before it can be made available via the Play Store. How long that approval process takes typically depends on the app.\nPrepare to see a lot more Donald Trump on social media again. Truth Social is no longer siloed behind an iOS-only mobile app. Trump's alternative social network, Truth Social, pushed out a notification on Friday to its current iOS app users informing them that a web version of the platform is now available.\u00a0 \"TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS,\" the Truth Social notification reads. \"The Truth Social Web App is now available! Tell them to go to https://truthsocial.com for more info.\" Users who visit the Truth Social website will now find a full-fledged web-version of the platform, where they can log in, post to their feed, and view content from other Truth Social users. Previously, those who went to the Truth Social website were just shown a landing page encouraging visitors to download the iOS app.  Much like Truth Social's mobile iOS app, the web app also looks and acts much like a Twitter clone. Truth Social was previously only available to users on Apple iOS devices, such as the iPhone. Yes, the iPhone has a huge smartphone market share. However, roughly half of mobile users have a non-iOS device. Now, basically anyone with internet access can sign up and create an account on Donald Trump's social media platform. However, Android users are still waiting for a Truth Social app specifically for their device.

People can use the network to post \u201cTruths,\u201d the platform\u2019s equivalent to tweets, and it's possible to reshare posts on one's timeline to expand their reach.

Update 2/21/2022 2:28 AM ET: Truth Social has indeed appeared in the iOS App Store, though some users are reportedly having trouble creating accounts, according to CNET. Some are receiving an error message when they try to enter a birthdate, email or phone number, while others say they were placed on a waitlist.

The 79th annual Golden Globe Awards will be held on Sunday, Jan. 9, 2022. Chris Pizzello / AP The nominees for best picture, drama, went to Jane Campion's gothic Western \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi epic \u201cDune,\u201d the family drama \u201cCODA,\u201d Reinaldo Marcus Green's tennis biopic \u201cKing Richard\u201d and Kenneth Branagh's autobiographical \u201cBelfast.\u201d The comedy or musical picks for best picture were: Adam McKay's apocalyptic comedy \u201cDon't Look Up,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201870s ode to San Fernando Valley \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda's \u201cTick, Tick ... Boom!\u201d and Joe Wright's \u201cCyrano.\u201d \"Belfast\" and \"The Power of the Dog\" tied for the most nominations with seven apiece. Netflix dominated the film nominees with 17 nods in total. HBO's \"Succession\" led the TV side with five nominations, including nods for best drama and best actor in a drama series for recent New Yorker profile subject Jeremy Strong.\nOn Tuesday night, the Golden Globes were held for the 80th time in history, though this year's ceremony was notable for a bigger reason. The awards show that is supposed to honor excellence in film and TV has been trying to recover from a racial exclusion scandal after a 2021 Los Angeles Times story revealed that none of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press members was Black. Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape. After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.\nBest Picture Drama: \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d Jane Campion\u2019s first film in more than a decade, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d took home the most prestigious award of the night. \u201cPower of the Dog\u201d won Best Picture Drama, Best Director Motion Picture (Jane Campion), and Best Supporting Actor \u2014 Motion Picture (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\u00a0 The acclaimed Netflix drama was the most-nominated movie along with \u201cBelfast,\u201d with each film earning seven nominations. Campion became the third woman to win in this category at Golden Globes. Best Television Series \u2014 Musical or Comedy: \u201cHacks\u201d HBO Max\u2019s \u201cHacks\u201d won the main Television (Musical or Comedy) category and Best Actress \u2014 Comedy/Musical for star Jean Smart at the 79th Golden Globes Awards. While other shows in this category were also strong contenders, such as Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d proved to be a favorite in this category with its first season. \u201cHacks can laugh all the way to the bank with this one,\u201d announced the official Golden Globes account via Twitter. \u201cCongratulations on taking home the #GoldenGlobe for Best Musical/Comedy Series.\u201d Best Television Series \u2014 Drama: \u201cSuccession\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d was the big winner at this year\u2019s Golden Globes, scooping three major categories.\nOn the TV side, ABC comedy Abbott Elementary \u2014 which boasted the most nominations of any show with five \u2014 built off of its Emmy momentum and went to the head of the class, winning best comedy honors and Golden Globes for Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams. An even bigger Emmy magnet, HBO's The White Lotus, enjoyed the privilege of converting its four nominations into two awards, one for best limited series and another for Jennifer Coolidge (who also delivered the funniest speech of the night). And then Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon added some surprise to the night by claiming the best drama award. Elsewhere, T\u00e1r's Cate Blanchett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's Angela Bassett, and Elvis' Austin Butler scored trophies, along with The Bear's Jeremy Allen White, Euphoria's Zendaya, and Yellowstone's Kevin Costner.

Beijing was selected as host city in 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in East Asia following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\nby Brendan Rourke The opening ceremony for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 featured a snowflake design made with the names of all of the participating countries inside of it. This event took place on Feb. 4, 2022 in Beijing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Exactly one year ago today, the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 kicked off with a beautiful opening ceremony. The Games marked the 24th Winter Olympic Games in history, lasted a total of 17 days, and featured a record 109 events spread over 15 disciplines. Team USA sent a contingent of 224 phenomenal athletes who trained day and night for the opportunity to represent the red, white, and blue. When the Games concluded, Team USA secured 25 medals\u00a0\u2014 eight gold, 10 silver and seven bronze. It was the third-most of any country that participated. Several athletes posted personal bests, and a few even made historical firsts. Throughout the month, Team USA will be posting 12 incredible moments for fans to relive across its social media platforms. Below is a list of those moments in chronological order. Deedra Irwin competes in the women's 15-kilometer individual biathlon during the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 on Feb. 7, 2022 in Zhangjiakou, China.\nThe closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.[60]  The 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports.[61] There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[62]  Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.  In October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing.[63] In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing.\nBy\u00a0         Bill Chappell                        The Beijing Winter Olympics are set to open in February.

Visitors recently watched a light show at the newly built ski jumping center in northern China's Hebei province. We're still in the final days of the Tokyo Summer Olympics \u2014 but thanks to the one-year delay of these Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are now less than six months away. \"All venues and facilities for Beijing 2022 are close to complete,\" organizers said in a recent update.  Those structures range from luge tracks and skating rinks to snowboard courses. The 12 ice and snow venues are scattered between Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, which includes a large mountain resort. Test events were held at those venues this year to fine-tune them for  competition, organizers said. While many facilities are brand-new, some may look familiar: The famous \"Water Cube\" that hosted Olympic swimming in 2008, for instance, is now the \"Ice Cube,\" to host curling.\nThere were three different clusters of venues designed and constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics, each respectively known as the Beijing Zone, the Zhangjiakou Zone, and the Yanging Zone.[16]  Venues in the Beijing Zone exist in different conditions; some were recently constructed exclusively for the 2022 games, while the rest were renovated from the 2008 Summer Olympics or other existing sites.[17] The Beijing Zone of the 2022 Winter Olympics consisted of six competition venues and was where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, for both the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, would take place.[17]  Five ice events were held at the Olympic Green, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center, which had been some of the main venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\nQuestion:When does the 2022 Olympic Winter Games end?\nAnswer:"

Today, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft\u2019s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse. Microsoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard\u2019s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world\u2019s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cDiablo,\u201d \u201cOverwatch,\u201d \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush,\u201d in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. The company has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees.\nThe FTC, after failing to obtain injunctions to block the merger, formally withdrew its challenge in July 2023, and the CMA subsequently agreed to put the case on hold to negotiate with both companies. The deal is now expected to close by October 18, 2023.  Activision Blizzard is one of the largest video game publishers in the world, with annual revenues of about $8.8\u00a0billion in 2021.[1] The company is composed of five business units:[2] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[3] Major League Gaming,[4] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[5][6] Among its assets are ownership of Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro from Activision's studios; Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment; and Candy Crush Saga from King.[7][8]  Microsoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles. In March 2021, Microsoft closed on its acquisition of ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks for an estimated $7.5\u00a0billion, making it one of the largest video game acquisitions by that time.[9]  On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7\u00a0billion in an all-cash deal, or approximately $95 per share.\nWhen the news of the acquisition first broke, in January 2022, Reuters ran the headline \u2018Microsoft to gobble up Activision in a $69 billion metaverse bet\u2018. This was at the height of the metaverse trend and would be the largest gaming industry deal in history. Microsoft is said to have wanted to acquire Activision Blizzard to further improve its presence in the gaming industry, and the metaverse, and to consolidate itself as the de facto king of cloud gaming.\u00a0 With Activision\u2019s titles under its umbrella and with Xbox and its Game Pass and XboX Live platforms to support it, few companies could challenge Microsoft in the gaming field. Acquiring Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft access to multi-million dollar IPs such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and WarCraft franchises, as well as studios such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, at a time when video game IP is proving highly valuable \u2014 just see the success of HBO\u2019s The Last of Us adaptation. The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League. Couple all this with Activision Blizzard\u2019s internal problems and affairs, and the fact that its CEO Bobby Kotick was investigated by the SEC, and one can see what makes the deal appealing to both sides.\nActivision Blizzard's stock price jumped nearly 40% that day in pre-market trading. The deal would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world and the largest headquartered in the Americas, behind Chinese company Tencent and the Japanese conglomerate Sony. If closed, it would also be the most expensive video game-related acquisition in to date.[10] Goldman Sachs will serve as the financial advisor to Microsoft, and Allen & Company will be Activision's financial advisors. Simpson Thacher will serve as legal advisor for Microsoft while Skadden will serve as legal advisor for Activision.[11] The deal has been approved by both companies' board of directors and is expected to close in 2023 following international government regulatory review of the action.[12][13] Upon completion of the deal, Activision Blizzard would be a sibling entity to Xbox Game Studios under a new Microsoft Gaming division with Phil Spencer as its lead. The deal would also allow Microsoft to offer Activision Blizzard games on its Xbox Game Pass service.[13] Spencer also spoke about reviving some older Activision Blizzard franchises he himself enjoyed, mentioning series such as King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen: Beyond Heretic.[14]  Kotick stated that he, Spencer, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella have had discussions in 2021 on their concern of the power of Tencent, NetEase, Apple, Inc.\nChecking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  In this article Microsoft announced Tuesday it will buy video game giant Activision Blizzard in a $68.7 billion all-cash deal. The price means Microsoft will pay $95 per share for Activision. Activision's stock ended the day up more than 25%, closing at $82.31 per share on Tuesday. Microsoft's shares closed down more than 2%. This would be Microsoft's largest acquisition to date, followed by its purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion. Activision, which is known for popular games such as Call of Duty and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, has been mired in controversy for the last several months after reports of sexual misconduct and harassment among the company's executives.\nQuestion:How much is Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for?\nAnswer:"

See below to check out what ads stood out in 2023. What a Super Bowl commercial cost in any given year is just as much a part of the overall buzz as the ads themselves. As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000. To put that into perspective, it cost roughly $233,000 per second for an ad in the 2022 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. Believe it or not, though, it\u2019s money well spent for the advertisers\u2014where else in the fragmented days of social media and streaming yanking away audiences (and their attention) will you get 100 million viewers\u2026who are typically more interested in the ads than the actual game? And the costs work just as well for the network that airs the Super Bowl: a recent figure showed earnings of $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue. Any guesses as to what a 2023 Super Bowl commercial will cost? It\u2019s another record high\u2014take a look.\n15 million 1990: $700,400 1985: $525,000 1980: $222,000 1975: $107,000 1970: $78,200 1967 (Super Bowl I): $37,500/$42,500 (NBC/CBS) According to AdAge, 30-second spots will cost companies a record $7 million. Last year, Super Bowl LVI ads costed $6.5 million.\nA star-studded lineup of Super Bowl LVII commercials is set to hit our screens on Sunday. While millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year\u2019s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let\u2019s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:\u00a0 Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.\nThe pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million \u2013 down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.\u00a0 GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials.

While mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, USA (1962\u20131970), Allen risked his place in society, his political future, and his life when he testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee in support of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[2]  The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage recognizes individuals who, like Mayor Allen, stand up for moral principles and render service to humanity without regard for personal or professional peril.

Previously, the tech giant was in the plan to bring the DayDream VR headsets as well as Google Glasses. Now, the boom of Augmented Reality might have changed the direction of the company to concentrate on the AR world making them join the league after Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. The codename of these new AR headsets is\u00a0Project Iris and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work wirelessly and doesn\u2019t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year\u2019s announced Pixel 6 smartphone.  This Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of \u201cski goggles\u201d with cameras on them which doesn\u2019t require external power. Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101 chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that remotely render graphics.

Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.\nThe company is also developing a new AR device codenamed \"Project Cambria.

In addition, both Meta and Apple have acquired AR startups in recent years. \u00a0 It is also known that Microsoft has released an AR device called \"HoloLens\", Snap has released smart glasses called \"Spectacles\", and the recently released Pixy, a flying camera, has added AR effects. \u00a0 Reference\uff1a https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23057579/google-acquires-raxium-microled-ar-vr-displays https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/google-acquires-microled-startup-raxium-for-future-ar-and-mr-tech/ https://blog.\n3][4] In May 2019, Google VR/AR head Clay Bavor told CNET that the company was heavily invested in R&D regarding AR devices,[5] while a February 2020 report from The Information revealed that Google had no plans to develop a new pair of augmented reality (AR) smartglasses as of mid-2019, in part due to the highly publicized failure of Glass.[6] In June 2020, Google acquired North, a manufacturer of smartglasses, to assist in its hardware division's vision of ambient computing.[7]  In August 2021, following the announcement that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones would feature the custom-developed Tensor system-on-chip (SoC), Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Business Insider that he believed that Tensor had long-term potential for AR-powered smartglasses,[8] and was echoed by CEO Sundar Pichai in October.[9] In November, a \"Google Labs\" division led by Bavor was created to oversee Google's AR and virtual reality (VR) ventures, unrelated to the defunct service of the same name,[10] while development on an AR operating system began the next month for an unknown \"innovative AR device\", an effort spearheaded by Mark Lucovsky.[11] Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Google was working on a \"new iteration\" of smartglasses as a result of its acquisition of North.\nBesides, the Google Employee\u00a0Clay Bavor that lead the Cardboard; DayDream VR as well as the recent big-time project of the company; Project Starline is working for this upcoming project. Although, the release of this project is slated until 2024 which gives an ample time slot of two years for research and development. The project along with Clay Bavor includes up to 300 more employees working on the Iris AR headsets along with the Google Assistant creator Scott Huffman. Moreover, the list goes on featuring Google AR operating systems senior director Mark Lucovsky; ARCore manager Shahram Izadi, and former light-field camera startup Lytro CTO Kurt Akeley.

Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an \u201cAI supercomputer\u201d \u2014 a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world\u2019s fastest.  \u201cMeta has developed what we believe is the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer,\u201d said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it\u2019ll be complete later this year.\u201d  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own \u201cAI supercomputers,\u201d which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta\u2019s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company\u2019s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse \u2014\u00a0the company\u2019s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.\nMeta Unveils AI Supercomputer for the Metaverse   \t\t\t\t\tThis item in \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tjapanese \t\t\t\t\t   Feb 01, 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmin read \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t by    Daniel Dominguez   Meta has unveiled its AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer, aimed at accelerating AI research and helping the company build the metaverse. The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta\u2019s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta\u2019s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta\u2019s services today, but also in the metaverse.\nMeta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min) Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

It was an attempt at a projection of strength from Meta, which historically has been slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware systems \u2014 hobbling its ability to keep pace with rivals such as Google and Microsoft. \u201cBuilding our own [hardware] capabilities gives us control at every layer of the stack, from datacenter design to training frameworks,\u201d Alexis Bjorlin, VP of Infrastructure at Meta, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis level of vertical integration is needed to push the boundaries of AI research at scale.\u201d Over the past decade or so, Meta has spent billions of dollars recruiting top data scientists and building new kinds of AI, including AI that now powers the discovery engines, moderation filters and ad recommenders found throughout its apps and services. But the company has struggled to turn many of its more ambitious AI research innovations into products, particularly on the generative AI front. Until 2022, Meta largely ran its AI workloads using a combination of CPUs \u2014 which tend to be less efficient for those sorts of tasks than GPUs \u2014 and a custom chip designed for accelerating AI algorithms.\nMeta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today\u2019s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a \u201cfamily\u201d of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (\u201cInferencing\u201d refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta \u201cTo gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that\u2019s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,\u201d Bjorlin continued. \u201cThis provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.\u201d Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.\nQuestion:What is the name of Meta's AI supercomputer?\nAnswer:"

For years, the Super Bowl commences on the first Sunday in February. Yet, because money speaks louder than Stephen A. Smith with a microphone, the NFL expanded their season to 17 games. This pushes the league\u2019s premier product to February 13, the latest in the game\u2019s history. SoFi Stadium gets the nod to host the Super Bowl in 2022.

The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.

Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below\u00a0are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and\u00a0R&B legends in 2022.\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.\u00a0Blige\u00a0and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton. She\u00a0recently became the first Black artist to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album of the Year.\u00a0 Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan performed the anthem in 2021.\nOne part of the partnership included that Roc Nation would take a big part in advising the league who they should choose for performances such as the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show will be the first for all artists aside from Blige\u2019s appearance in 2001. Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don\u2019t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It\u2019s not wild to assume they get back there, given they\u2019ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL. The Bills (+1000), Ravens (+1400), and Browns (+1600) are the other preseason contenders in the AFC.\nQuestion:Super Bowl 2022 date?MORE SUPER BOWL: Halftime show | Ticket prices | Commercials The Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022. It marks the first time since 2003 that the Super Bowl has not been held on the first Sunday in February. Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held. Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14. NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the \"Sunday Night Football\" crew will presumably broadcast the event. NBC's last Super Bowl broadcast came in 2019, when Tom Brady's Patriots beat Jared Goff's Rams 13-3. SoFi Stadium \u2014 the home of the Rams and the Chargers \u2014 will host the Super Bowl in 2022. Originally, the new stadium, which opened in 2020, was scheduled to host the Super Bowl in 2021. However, weather-related construction delays caused the league to move the 2021 Super Bowl to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, Fla. and the 2022 Super Bowl to Los Angeles.\nAnswer:"

Rams 23, Bengals 20 -- FINAL (Photo: Rob Carr / Getty Images)   February 14, 2022 at 8:41 PM EST LOS ANGELES \u2014 When Johnny Hekker took the stage, the crowd knew it was on.\nSuper Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23\u201320. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12\u20135 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10\u20137 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.\nBut they didn\u2019t \u2014 not the \u201cbig names\u201d about whom much was made throughout the year, not the young players thrust into the pressure of this moment and what the team needed from them, begged from them even without being sure they could get it done.

The finality of being 43 seconds away from extending the Super Bowl and watching the final attempt fall incomplete hits like Aaron Donald. It dropped Boyd to his knees.  Boyd didn\u2019t move as the Rams\u2019 celebration began with players sprinting all around the field. Ja\u2019Marr Chase tossed his helmet in frustration. A stunned Joe Burrow limped to the sidelines.  This wasn\u2019t just about the finality of a dream season where the Bengals redefined the image of a franchise and reignited a love affair between the city and its sports team.  The stunning, numbing feeling of Rams 23, Bengals 20 came from the fact Cincinnati turned this game into everything they needed it to be.

The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.[2]  The 2022 Rams finished 5\u201312, setting the records for the most losses, lowest winning percentage (.294), and longest losing streak (six games) for a defending Super Bowl champion.[183][184] They were also the first defending Super Bowl champion to miss the playoffs since the 2016 Denver Broncos and first to have a losing record since the 2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  The 2022 Bengals tied their franchise-best 12\u20134 record[a] and clinched the franchise's first consecutive division title. They won a playoff game in consecutive seasons, another franchise first, before being defeated by the eventual Super Bowl LVII champion Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game.\nLouis 23, Tennessee 16-With the Titans driving in the final minute to try and tie the game, Mike Jones tackled WR Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line, preserving the victory for the Rams. St. Louis QB Kurt Warner threw for a Super Bowl record 414 yards and added two touchdown passes, but the Rams kept coming up short of the end zone as Jeff Wilkins kicked three field goals, which allowed the Titans to keep the game close. Super Bowl XXXV-Baltimore 34, NY Giants 7-The Ravens' swarming defense, led by LB Ray Lewis, set the tone by forcing five turnovers and sacking Giants QB Kerry Collins four times. RB Jamal Lewis led the Ravens with 102 yards and a touchdown, and each team scored TDs on kickoff returns. The Ravens' three touchdowns in a span of 36 seconds was a Super Bowl record.

Though the explosive Rams offense out gained the Patriots 427-267 in total yards, St. Louis could not overcome a 3-0 turnover differential. Though Patriots QB Tom Brady was held to 145 yards and a touchdown pass, he won the MVP by leading his team down the field for the winning field goal with no timeouts.\nQuestion:Who won the Super Bowl 2022?\nAnswer:"

You can\u2019t help but feel like a combat god when you divekick a crowd, and blast fodder monsters into bloody chunks.\nLost Ark[a] is a 2019 MMO action role-playing game[1][2] co-developed by Tripod Studio and Smilegate.[3] It was released in South Korea in December 2019 by Smilegate and in Europe, North America, and South America in February 2022 by Amazon Games.[1][4][5] Lost Ark cost around US$85 million to develop.[6] The game received generally favorable reviews and is among the most-played games on Steam.  Lost Ark is primarily focused on player versus environment (PvE) and exploration (questing, achievement/collectible hunting, crafting, etc.). It features player versus player (PvP) elements as well.[7] Players start by customizing their character which they can then level up by completing the storyline.[8] Reaching level 50 unlocks access to tiered endgame dungeons and raids, at which point most further progress is tied to the character's gear score.  Lost Ark's development began in 2011[9] under the codename Project T.[10][11] The game uses Unreal Engine 3.[12] It originally only supported DirectX 9[13][14] but was updated to also support DirectX 11 prior to the western release in 2022.[15]\nDen of Geek    Ad Lost Ark is one of Steam's biggest hits in a long time, but what time will you be able to play the free-to-play version of the game? Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam\u2019s biggest hits of 2022, but the game\u2019s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they\u2019ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.

The 30-year-old cross-country skier, who snagged bronze in the individual sprint Feb. 8, took silver in the 30-kilometer freestyle race. \u201cIt\u2019s really emotional,\u201d she told NBC. \u201cThat was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done in my whole life, especially because I had food poisoning 30 hours ago, which is why I thought I was going to die at the finish line. My legs were cramping the whole last 17 kilometers. I don\u2019t know how I made it.\u201d With her victory, Diggins, who won gold in the 2018 women\u2019s team sprint, now owns an Olympic medal in every color. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional roller-coaster, but I am so happy we made it to the end,\u201d Diggins told reporters. \u201cTo have a medal in the sprint and the 30K are the ultimate bookends for me. I have been trying to be a good all-round athlete my whole life, so this has been really cool.\u201d Diggins finished the final cross-country race of the Beijing Olympics in 1 hour 26 minutes 37 seconds, less than two minutes behind Therese Johaug of Norway and 50 seconds ahead of third-place finisher Kerttu Niskanen of Finland.\nDiggins took silver in the 30km mass start to become the first American cross-country skier to win two medals at an Olympic Winter Games. Jessie Diggins enhanced her legacy as USA's greatest cross-country skier with silver in the 30km mass start free at Beijing 2022 on Sunday. Diggins, 30, was second to Norway's Therese Johaug, who claimed her third individual title in Beijing, to win her country's 25th and final medal of these Olympic Winter Games. Having already won bronze in the individual sprint, making her USA's first woman to win a medal in cross-country, she became the first American cross-country skier to win two medals at a single Games. It's yet more history for Diggins who also claimed Team USA's first gold in the sport with Kikkan Randall in the PyeongChang 2018 team sprint. Incredibly, she had suffered from food poisoning on the eve of her final event of the Games. She told Olympics.com that she did not carry much confidence into the race, saying, \"If I'm being honest, 24 hours ago I felt really bad and I just laid in bed yesterday mostly and ate food and drank sport drinks. \"But it worked and I think maybe because it's been so cold and so hard, maybe extra rest is what I needed.\" Given that less-than-ideal preparation, it was perhaps no surprise that Diggins collapsed immediately after crossing the line.\n20: Diggins wins her second 2022 Olympic medal.

To handle these pressures, Diggins\u2019 approach was quite different from the \u201ceye on the prize\u201d medal-focus one might expect. \u201cFor me, it was just important to make sure I could still focus on the process. And so I wasn\u2019t focused on winning, I wasn\u2019t focused on metals, I was just focused on doing my best every single day. So I could come here prepared and happy and in a good place.\u201d And it worked. Click a photo to view as a slideshow. In their first Olympic appearance, Sweden\u2019s Jonna Sundling and Maja Dahlqvist went one-two in the freestyle sprint.\u00a0 For those who have followed the sport over the last Olympic cycle, seeing these women atop the podium was no surprise. The two were partners in the freestyle team sprint during the 2021 World Championships in Oberstdorf, Germany, where they controlled the race from the front, adding a final surge to take the win ahead of Switzerland and Slovenia. This was Dahlqvist\u2019s second World Championship team sprint title; she also won the event in the 2019 World Championships in Seefeld, Austia, racing with Stina Nilsson.\nHe backed that up with a spectacular free skate routine which included four quads and placed first by a margin of 22.55 points.

The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It\u2019s actually easy to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED:\u00a010 Thriller Movies With The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, constantly wondering just what\u2019s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries) will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It\u2019s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There\u2019s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader\u2019s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles. American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.\nThe Endgame is an American crime drama thriller television series that premiered on NBC on February 21, 2022. The series is created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn.[1][2] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[3]  In this heist drama, criminal mastermind Elena Federova squares off against principled FBI agent Val Turner.[4]  On April 21, 2021, The Untitled Nick Wootton/Jake Coburn Project was given a pilot order by NBC. It was created by Nicholas Wootton and Jake Coburn who were expected to executive produce alongside Julie Plec and Emily Cummins. Wootton also wrote the pilot.[5] On September 21, 2021, NBC ordered The Endgame to series. Justin Lin and Andrew Schneider were added as executive producers. Lin also directed the pilot. Universal Television, Nicholas Wootton Productions, Jake Coburn Productions, Inc., My So-Called Company, and Perfect Storm Entertainment are the production companies involved with producing the series.[1] Upon the series order, Morena Baccarin, Ryan Michelle Bath\u00e9, Kamal Angelo Bolden, Costa Ronin, Noah Bean, Jordan Johnson-Hinds, and Mark D. Espinoza were cast in starring roles.[6] On November 18, 2021, Karl Josef Co and Massiel Mordan were added to the cast.\nThe show centered on a professional thief named Mickey O\u2019Neil (played by the dashing Dougray Scott), the man who was orchestrating probably one of the biggest heists that Los Angeles \u2013 and maybe even the world \u2013 had ever seen. Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood\u2019s elite to notice the elaborate heist unfold. \u00a0  NBC\u2019s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bath\u00e9, The Endgame follows Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why. But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena\u2019s ambitious plan and discover what her endgame is. \u00a0  The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted TV show is watching it unfold knowing it\u2019s completely based on real-life events. That\u2019s exactly the case with ITV\u2019s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton Garden, London.\nDid you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark? Welcome to\u00a0The Witching Hour! Collider\u2019s horror podcast, co-created and co-hosted by Editor and Horror Lead\u00a0Haleigh Foutch\u00a0and Senior Editorial Producer\u00a0Perri Nemiroff. On this week's episode, we dig into the exciting lineup for the Overlook Film Festival before serving up a review for Netflix's latest horror series\u00a0Chambers and why it doesn't quite hit the mark. After that, we break down which of Netflix's horror series have made the best use of the streaming and bingeing model, as well as the value's of week-to-week sensations like\u00a0Game of Thrones, and Haleigh gives her thoughts on the first two episodes of\u00a0The 100\u00a0Season 6.

The Fall is yet another series that focuses its story on a battle of wits between law enforcement and a serial killer. What\u2019s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who\u00a0exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there\u2019s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It\u2019s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI. Those who enjoy that particular aspect of the series will also find much to like about Quantico.\nQuestion:What is the genre of The Endgame (TV show)?\nAnswer:"

Ukraine enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation.  Russian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. In April, Russia launched a renewed battle of Donbas. Russian forces continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly-occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast. In February 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a new offensive in Donbas. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.  The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-11/1 condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid and sales to Ukraine.\nJump to        Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.\n[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]\nHe falsely claimed they had been \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime\".[74] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[75] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine.[76] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[75] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[77] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[78] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[79]  The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[72] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[80][81] which reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40\u00a0a.m. Kyiv time.\n(GRIGORY SYSOYEV/AFP/Getty Images) Early in 2021, Zelenskyy cracked down on pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs, including Viktor Medvedchuk, a close friend of Putin. Subsequently, Putin deploys increasing numbers of troops near the Ukrainian border and publishes an article claiming that Russians and Ukrainians are \u201cone people.\u201d By December, tens of thousands of Russian troops are deployed to the borders and Putin issues demands to NATO and the United States. Among these demands is that Ukraine never be admitted to NATO \u2013 a request rejected by the Biden administration.\u00a0 (Vadim Ghirda/AP) In 2014, the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk broke away from Ukraine, under the leadership of what the Ukrainian government considered to be Russian-backed terrorists. Following the breakdown of relations with NATO and the West in late February, Putin recognized these territories as independent states and sent troops in to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d (Emilio Morenatti/AP) Days after recognizing the breakaway territories, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in the eastern Ukrainian territory of Donbas. Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine and officially broke diplomatic ties with Russia. Putin\u2019s actions were condemned across the world and within Russia.

Elden Ring has practically become a meme during its much-awaited journey from edit suite to shelves. Between an\u00a0initial reveal at E3 2019 and E3 2021, precious little had been shown about the game, save for some key art and the promise it\u2019d be made in collaboration with Game of Thrones\u2018 George R. R. Martin. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lot to go on. But finally, it\u2019s almost here. Developer FromSoftware (known for the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro) and publisher Bandai Namco, who have kept shtum over few years, have increasingly been teasing more and more about the game ahead of its imminent release. \u201cWith Elden Ring, we have applied all our dark fantasy and action-RPG expertise cultivated throughout the Dark Souls series, in order to create a bold, classical evolution of the genre,\u201d commented Hidetaka Miyazaki, director at FromSoftware. \u201cWe\u2019ve crafted a rich world with a staggering sense of scale, based off of legends written for the game by George R. R. Martin. Elden Ring is a world full of mystery and peril, ready to be explored and discovered; a drama in which various characters flaunt their own mystique and ulterior motives. We sincerely hope you enjoy experiencing it for yourself.\n\u201cWhat this represented in them is this sort of golden light, or this golden aura, that\u2019s specifically shown in their eyes. And this symbolises the blessing or the grace of the Erdtree. However, after a time, there were some individuals who lost this grace, and the light faded from their eyes. And these are what are known as the Tarnished.\u201d The Tarnished were banished and exiled from the game\u2019s world many years prior to when you \u2013 the player \u2013 will enter it. Since their ex-communication, the eponymous Elden Ring has of course been shattered and now the Tarnished are being summoned back to The Lands Between. So what are you waiting for?

Just as I had reached a somewhat healthy place in my life again\u2014I sleep eight hours a night, spend quality time with my cat, and work out, sometimes!\u2014this happened:  Elden Ring DLC. 2022's near-unanimous Game of the Year (it surely was here at Esquire) will, at last, return\u2014surely with new and surprising methods of torture. The news arrives roughly a year after the debut of the game. You'll play as the \"Tarnished,\" a mysterious character who returns from exile to redeem (or further destroy!) a hellish, rotting world. Many a gamer will tell you that Elden Ring is one of the most difficult games they've ever played, forcing you to spend literal days of your time just to get the muscle to survive the first few bosses. Now, we're in for more pain. There's a blog post on Elden Ring Japan's website confirming the news. Here's what Google Translate tells me it says:  What in the George R. R. Martin procrastinblogging hell does that mean? The gamers over at Kotaku are speculating that the figure you see riding Torrent\u2014the Bullseye to your Jesse in Elden Ring\u2014is Miquella.\nQuestion:When was Elden Ring being released?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "The defending champion needed just 53 minutes to advance, 6-0, 6-1, on Wednesday at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open.ByTENNIS.comPublished Feb 15, 2023 copy_link Published Feb 15, 2023 Iga Swiatek returned to the site where her masterful rise in 2022 began with a 37-match win streak. And what a statement the world No. 1 made at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha Wednesday.On paper, Swiatek\u2019s opening match presented intrigue. Across the net was Danielle Collins, one of the nine players to defeat the Pole during a banner 2022 season that saw her win eight titles and completely own her status as the 28th world No. 1 in WTA history.In reality, today's show was a solo act. Swiatek completely silenced Collins, serving up another bakery special with a 6-0, 6-1 victory.\"I'm happy that I was kind of composed and from the beginning till the end pretty focused and disciplined with tactics. So I didn't really let Danielle get into the rhythm,\" Swiatek told press. \"I wanted to be aggressive. I'm pretty happy that I did that well.\" On paper, Swiatek\u2019s opening match presented intrigue.\nIga Swiatek has done it again. For the second time this year, she\u2019s standing at the top of a podium, holding a Grand Slam trophy above her head. This time, she defeated Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6(5) to win the 2022 US Open, capping off a year of incredible and unexpected success. Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments. Swiatek claimed the first set in 30 minutes flat, and made it look as effortless as ever.\n3: Top 10 players Swiatek defeated en route to her first title of the season in Doha. The win is the second WTA 1000 title of her career.\u00a0 0: Wins for Swiatek against Maria Sakkari (0-3) and Aryna Sabalenka (0-1) going into Doha. After beating them in back-to-back matches in Doha, she has not lost to either player since. 1: Set lost by Swiatek in Doha, which came to Viktorija Golubic in the first round.\u00a0 2: Games lost in the final against Anett Kontaveit.\u00a0  Champions Corner: Swiatek's 'surreal' Indian Wells 20: Wins for Swiatek in 2022 after defeating Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-1 in the final, the most on tour.\u00a0 2: Swiatek's new career-high ranking after winning her second-straight WTA 1000 title. 3: Comebacks from a set down for Swiatek in Indian Wells, doing so to beat Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in her first three matches. She has had seven such comebacks in 2022. Prior to this season, she had just eight in her career.\u00a0 11: Consecutive wins for Swiatek, tying then No.\n11] As of January 2022, \u015awi\u0105tek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]  In February, \u015awi\u0105tek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15]  At Indian Wells, \u015awi\u0105tek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, \u015awi\u0105tek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.[16]\nThe second set was entirely different from the first. While Jabeur again didn't win a game until Swiatek was up 3-0, she finally found her gear. Her excellent slice finally began to appear and she began going to the net more, helping her win four of the next five games. Swiatek appeared to have finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close, and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the best year of Swiatek's young career \u2014 or the best year of anyone\u2019s career, really. She started 2022 by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we\u2019ve seen in decades. Swiatek beat Annet Kontaveit to win the Qatar Open.\nQuestion:Who did Iga Swiatek defeat to win the Qatar Open 2022?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Published on 2/21/2022 at 11:04 AM The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics have ended after over two weeks of some dramatic, inspiring, and comedic moments. The medals given out during these games were are made up of five rings and a center and are called \"Tong Xin,\" which means \"together as one.\" Unlike during the summer games in Tokyo just last year, the top gold medal winner of the winter games is not\u00a0the most expected. Instead, the biggest gold medal winner of the 2022 Olympics is Norway. Overall, the nation took home significantly more medals than its competitors. Here's the breakdown of the five countries that won the biggest. Gold: 16Silver: 8Bronze: 13Total: 37 Gold: 6Silver: 12Bronze: 14Total: 32 Gold: 12Silver: 10Bronze: 5Total: 27 Gold: 4Silver: 8Bronze: 14Total: 26 Gold: 8Silver: 10Bronze: 7Total: 25 When it came to which countries won the most medals overall, Norway came in first. The Russian Olympic Committee (the unofficial team representing Russia's athletes) came in second with 32 medals. In third place was Germany, with 27 medals. Canada was next with 26 medals, and the US trailed behind with 25 medals.\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their country\u2019s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in Winter Olympics history before the start of the 2022 Winter Games:  Total: 130 Gold: 45 Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC Silver: 44 Bronze: 41 Medals won in PyeongChang: 20 Sport with most medals: Speed skating (121) Dutch speed skaters famously take the ice wearing orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland\u2019s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country\u2019s haul in its top summer sport, swimming (62).\nWith all 109 medal events decided, competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing is officially complete.\u00a0 After three weeks of dominance, Norway stands alone atop the chart with the most total medals (37) and the most gold medals (16). Norway broke its own record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 16, to go along with eight silver medals and 13 bronze medals. (Norway and Germany in 2018 both matched the record of 14 gold medals at a single Winter Olympics previously set by Canada in Vancouver 2010.) Norway narrowly missed eclipsing its high-water mark of 39 total medals, won in PyeongChang. The United States finished the Games with eight gold medals -- tied for the fourth most along with Sweden and the Netherlands. But America's total medal count of 25 put them fifth. In addition to eight golds, the U.S. tallied 10 silver medals and seven bronze medals. [RELATED: 2022 Winter Olympics medal count] The ROC finished second with 32 total medals (6 gold, 12 silver, 14 bronze). Germany, after absolutely dominating the sliding sports with gold medals in nine out of 10 events, slotted third with 27 total medals (12 gold, 10 silver, 5 bronze). And Canada eclipsed the U.S. for fourth with 26 total medals (4 gold, 8 silver, 14 bronze).\nThe 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold medals.\u00a0 After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix, France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case. The U.S. finished second with Japan in third and Canada in fourth.\u00a0            Note: Some components of NBCOlympics.com may not be optimized for users browsing with           Internet           Explorer 11, 10 or older browsers or systems.          \u00a9 2022 NBC Universal.

Sweden took home seven gold medals from PyeongChang in 2018, good for sixth out of all participating countries. Their collection of 14 total medals tied for 10th. Total: 167 Gold: 43 Silver: 63 Bronze: 61 Medals won in PyeongChang: 6 Sport with most medals: Cross country skiing (80) Like Sweden, Finland\u2019s top Winter Olympic sport is cross country skiing with 80 total medals. After cross country skiing, the country\u2019s next-best sports are speed skating (24 total medals), ski jumping (22) and Nordic combined (14).\u00a0 Finland had far and away the smallest haul from the 2018 Winter Olympics, winning just six total medals and only one gold. Four of the six medals, including the gold, came in cross-country skiing. A smaller collection is not uncommon for Finland despite their seventh-place spot on this list. It is the only country among the 10 included here that has never won 15 or more medals at a single Winter Olympics.\nQuestion:Which country won the most medals at the 2022 Winter Olympics?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won\u2019t be getting a new processor this year \u2014 instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that\u2019s in the iPhone 13 Pro \u2014 though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple\u2019s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though \u2014 like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn\u2019t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn\u2019t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple\u2019s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.\nApple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[22]  The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models lack a physical SIM tray.  The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[24] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow option was added on March 7, 2023.[25]  iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[6]  The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed system on a chip, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a faster A16 Bionic.[26][27]  The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine.\nYear introduced: 2022 Capacity:\u00a0128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Colors:\u00a0Midnight, starlight,\u00a0(PRODUCT)RED,\u00a0blue, purple,\u00a0yellow Model numbers:\u00a0A2649 (United States, Puerto Rico), A2881 (Canada, Guam, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Virgin Islands),\u00a0A2884 (China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao), A2883 (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia), A2882 (other countries and regions) Details: The\u00a0iPhone 14 has a 6.1 inch1\u00a0all-screen Super Retina XDR display.

Although Google I/O 2022 will be an in-person event, the attendance is limited to Google employees and partners. Kishan is a technology writer\u00a0with over five years of experience covering smartphones, headphones, wearables, and the Android ecosystem. He\u00a0first fell in love with Android when he purchased his Vodafone 858 Smart running Android 2.2, and has been hooked ever since.\nGoogle has released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Read on to know more. We\u2019re just two weeks away from Google I/O 2022. While the yearly event is primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general public. Google usually doesn\u2019t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai\u2019s \u201cGoogle I/O keynote\u201d at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event\u2019s description doesn\u2019t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google\u2019s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and \u201cWhat\u2019s new in Android.\u201d This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.\nGoogle I/O 2023 is expected to see the launch of new Pixel devices, AI tools, and more. Here's the complete lowdown, and how you can watch yourself. Google I/O is a developer event that always opens with a keynote during which Google unveils a host of new hardware and software products. Many fans are waiting to see what the company will unveil in 2023. If you're one of them, here's what you can expect to see, and how you can watch the event online when it airs on May 10th. Google I/O 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 10th, and will take place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. The in-person event will be hosted live for a small audience, but you can watch it online when it airs on the Google I/O website or head over to Google's YouTube channel. Although Google I/O is meant primarily for developers, the opening keynote will unveil the company's latest consumer products and services, and perhaps even a sneak peek into products coming later this year. Google hasn't officially revealed what it plans to show at I/O, but we can make some smart guesses based on things Google revealed at I/O 2022 last year and credible rumors. Here are some of the things we expect to see at Google I/O 2023.\nGoogle I/O 2023 was broadcast online and featured announcements on everything from Pixel Fold to Bard. Here's what you need to know. Google I/O is the biggest annual event for developers and consumers who are interested in the latest innovations from Google. The conference is where Google typically unveils new products and services and provides a sneak peek at what's coming. This year's show was held on 10 May 2023 as a hybrid event with a limited live audience and online access for everyone. Here's everything you need to know about Google I/O 2023. Google I/O is an annual developer conference hosted by Google, where the company showcases its latest technologies and products. The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch. We embedded the livestream at the top of this page - just hit play.\nThat's in line with when Google normally holds its developers conference \u2014 last year's edition took place on May 11 and May 12, for example. There will be an in-person event at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., a venue that's just down the street from Google headquarters. Most people will attend virtually, though since Google streams its developer conference. The Google I/O 2023 website promises a kickoff keynote that gets underway at 1 p.m. ET/ 10 a.m. PT/ 6 p.m. BST on May 10. A developer keynote will follow afterward, diving into more detail on tools available to Google developers. You can find a full Google I/O 2013 schedule listing the different presentations. The Google I/O 2023 agenda doesn't provide any specific details about what's in store on May 10. But we can make some educated guesses about what's on tap, given Google's past announcements and rumors about the company's current plans. Google Bard is just the start of the company's grand plans for AI-powered search. According to a report in The New York Times, Samsung is considering ditching Google as the default search engine for its devices in favor of Bing. And Google is feverishly working on the next stage of its search engine which will integrate a chatbot.\u00a0 Dubbed Project Magi, Google has reportedly devoted a large portion of its staff to accelerating the implementation of AI into its search engine.\nQuestion:When is Google I/O 2022 scheduled to take place?\nAnswer:"

China\u2019s first Mars rover will be named Zhurong after a traditional fire god, the government announced Saturday. The rover is aboard the Tianwen-1 probe that arrived in Mars orbit on February 24 and is due to land in May to look for evidence of life.  It is part of Chinese space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon. China in 2019 became the first country to land a space probe on the little-explored far side of the moon and in December returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s. The rover\u2019s title fits with the Chinese name for Mars \u2014 \u201cHuo Xing,\u201d or fire star, the China National Space Administration said. The name \u201csignifies igniting the flame of China\u2019s planetary exploration,\u201d a deputy CNSA administrator, Wu Yanhua, was cited by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying.\n39][40] Tianwen-1's rover is named Zhurong (Chinese: \u795d\u878d\u53f7), after a Chinese mytho-historical figure usually associated with fire and light.[41] The name was chosen through an online poll held from January to February 2021.[42]  China's Mars program started in partnership with Russia. In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]\nOn December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year. In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: \u5929\u95ee\u4e00\u53f7)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c.\u00a0340\u2013278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.\nOn 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site. It was the first public appearance of China's Mars exploration mission.[46]  As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was formally named \"Tianwen-1\".[47]  On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22]  In September 2020, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed the Tianwen-1 First Deployable Camera (TDC-1), a small satellite with two cameras that took photos of and tested a radio connection with Tianwen-1.[10] Its mission was to photograph the Tianwen-1 orbiter and the lander's heat shield.[10] Due to the time when it was deployed, it trajectory predicted to do a flyby of Mars with that happening around the orbit insertion date.  During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.\nA Mars probe is launched on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province, July 23, 2020. (Xinhua/Cai Yang)The most challenging part of the mission will be the soft landing in May, an autonomous process of the probe lasting seven to eight minutes. The probe will use its aerodynamic shape, parachute and retrorocket to decelerate and buffer legs to touch down, according to the CNSA.Chinese space engineers and scientists have chosen a relatively flat region in the southern part of the Utopia Planitia, a large plain, as the potential landing zone.Earlier research showed the potential landing site might be the edge of an ancient ocean or lake in the early history of Mars. Chinese scientists are looking forward to finding more evidence of water-ice.The scientific goals of Tianwen-1 include mapping the morphology and geological structure, investigating surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution, analyzing the surface material composition, measuring the ionosphere and the characteristics of the Martian climate and environment at the surface and perceiving the physical fields and internal structure of Mars.The orbiter is equipped with seven kinds of scientific instruments: two remote-sensing cameras, Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Mineralogy Spectrometer, Mars Magnetometer, Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer and Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer.\nQuestion:What is the name of China's rover on Mars?\nAnswer:"

UPDATE: officials confirm description of pro wrestler Shad Gaspard matches that of the body discovered after washing up on shore in Venice Beach. @FOXLA @GDLA @LACoLifeguards \ud83d\udc94 pic.twitter.com/1EGKkglcNf The award is reserved for an individual who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior, one of the most popular wrestlers to step foot in a ring. 39-year-old Gaspard personified those traits ... especially in the waning moments of his life. As we previously reported, the wrestler was swimming with his 10-year-old son near Venice Beach in L.A. when a strong rip current engulfed the two. Lifeguards were able to locate Gaspard and his son, but he told them to focus on getting his son to shore safely.\nAlso nominated for the Scholar-Athlete of the Year Award: Maria Allen (Women's Soccer), Kyle Clay (Baseball), Forrest Cooley (Men's Cross Country), Samantha Dara (Women's Cross Country), Bo Davis (Men's Wrestling), Abbygail Furrow (Women's Golf), Gemma LaVergne (Women's Basketball), Alise Olson (Softball), Evan Olson (Men's Track & Field), and Allyson Reid (Volleyball). The 2023 Golden Warrior Awards will have its final day of winners announced tomorrow at 3pm PDT, with the last three major awards being declared via the Mr. Corban, Ms. Corban, and the Mighty Warrior Awards.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won\u2019t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don\u2019t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items \u2014 the screen, keyboard and battery \u2014 were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back \u2014 meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.\nCobalt Blue with Alcantara\u00ae material palm rest Surface Laptop 3 15\"\r \t\t\tPlatinum with metal palm rest\r \t\t\tMatte Black with metal palm rest  Warranty  1-year limited hardware warranty  Weight  Surface Laptop 3 13.5\u201d\r \t\t\tSandstone and Matte Black: 2.84 lb (1,288 g)2\r \t\t\tCobalt Blue and Platinum: 2.79 lb (1,265 g)2 Surface Laptop 3 15\u201d\r \t\t\tPlatinum and Matte Black: 3.40 lb (1,542 g)2 * Some software and accessories sold separately. ** Extended return offer period available with Surface devices purchased from Microsoft Store in select markets.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I\u2019ll often refer to it as having a \u201claptop cart\u201d look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.\u00a0 With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company\u2019s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It\u2019s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see appealing to adults in the consumer space.\u00a0 If it weren\u2019t so dang slow.\u00a0 I\u2019m not gonna hold back here: this is the slowest computer I\u2019ve ever used.\nAccessories  The Surface Laptop SE is a laptop computer manufactured by Microsoft. Unveiled on November 9, 2021, it is an entry-level model in the Surface Laptop series positioned exclusively towards the education market. It was released on 9 November 2021.  The Surface Laptop SE has a plastic body and shares some components (such as the keyboard) with the Surface Laptop Go. Microsoft stated that it was designed to be more repairable than other Surface models, with replacement parts (such as batteries, displays, keyboards, and motherboards) to be available through its service partners for on-site repairs.[1][2]  The device uses an Intel Celeron CPU, with configurations using either a Celeron N4020 with 4\u00a0GB of RAM and 64\u00a0GB of internal storage, or the N4120 with 8\u00a0GB of RAM and 128\u00a0GB of internal storage. It has two USB ports, one of which is USB-C. Unlike other Surface models, the Laptop SE uses a round, non-magnetic power connector. It includes a 10.1-inch screen at 1366\u00d7768 resolution, and a one-megapixel webcam.[1][3]  It ships with Windows 11 SE, a variant of the operating system with optimizations for the education market.[3][4]\nNote:\u00a0Some\u00a0products might not be available in your country or region.

Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors.

Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps\u00a0\u2013 though the moment\u00a0was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened\u00a0since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.\u00a0 \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.\nFiled under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. \u201cI did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,\u201d marveled Diddy shortly after. \u201cThis action we are taking today in response to Will Smith\u2019s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,\u201d the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. \u201cWe also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.\u201d Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, \u201cI accept and respect the Academy\u2019s decision.\u201d Here\u2019s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.\n\"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he said.   For more on the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident at the Oscars, listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.   The debacle at Sunday's awards show unraveled after Rock made light of Jada's hair loss, which she's recently opened up about as a result of her years-long struggle with alopecia. \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see ya,\" he joked.   Will, 53, then walked onto stage and smacked Rock in the face, leaving the audience and live viewers around the world stunned. \"Oh wow,\" said a seemingly taken-aback Rock as Will made his way back to his seat. \"Will Smith just smacked the s\u2014 out of me.\"   \"Keep my wife's name out your f\u2014ing mouth!\" Smith yelled up to the stage at Rock after taking his seat again.   \"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,\" said Rock \u2014 to which Smith replied once again, \"Keep my wife's name out your f\u2014ing mouth!\"   \"I'm going to, okay?\" Rock replied, before going on to say, \"That was the ... greatest night in the history of television\" and presenting the award.\nAfter the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it \u201cdoes not condone violence of any form.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. \u201cThe incident involved one individual slapping another,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.\u201d \u201cThat was the greatest night in the history of television,\u201d Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs \u2014 on stage to introduce a tribute to \u201cThe Godfather\u201d \u2014 tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. \u201cWill and Chris, we\u2019re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,\u201d Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few \u2014 if anyone \u2014 wanted to discuss. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that,\u201d said Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, the director of \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith\u2019s milestone accomplishment.\n105] In the clips taken from a CBS Mornings interview, Carrey stated, \"You do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words\",[91] and that he would have sued Smith for $200 million if he were in Rock's position, saying, \"That video is going to be there forever. It's going to be ubiquitous. That insult is going to last a very long time.\" He further criticized the moral integrity of the Hollywood film industry for giving Smith a standing ovation after receiving his award.[106]  Anthony Hopkins, who presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating: \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"[107]  Comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward.[108][109] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating: \"That [slap] opened the floodgates. You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that [...] violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\".[110]\nQuestion:What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?\nAnswer:"

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.\nApple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.\nTrusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission.

The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple\u2019s latest chip for Macs, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn\u2019t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199/\u00a31249 \u2013 and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU. You\u2019ll need to pay an extra \u00a3100 if you want the 10-core GPU.\nThe fact that Apple has finally released the successor to 2020's industry-shaking M1 chip is exciting, especially if you're a Mac fan who's been eyeing a new 13-inch MacBook. The M2 chip is more of a mid-grade slice of Apple silicon that outperforms its M1 predecessor without matching the heights of the most tricked-out M1 Max.\u00a0 Read next: Windows vs macOS: Which is better for you?

The United States Men\u2019s National Team is back in the World Cup for the first time in eight years. The final draw for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was held on April 1, 2022. The United States Men\u2019s National Team was drawn to Group B.\n16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4\u20132 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]  Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]  The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day.\n371] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[372] to avoid the summer heat between May and September and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[373][374]  The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]\n[18] Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Gabriel Mercado put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's volley outside of the box \u2013 which was later voted as the goal of the tournament[19] \u2013 and then Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 twice.[20] Sergio Ag\u00fcero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.[21]  The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022. It was a variation of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning \"The Dream\" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup.[22] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\n239] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2\u20131 by virtue of goals from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[240][241]  The semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December.[31] Messi scored a penalty kick before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3\u20130 victory over Croatia, their biggest win margin in the 2022 tournament, reaching their sixth final and first since 2014.[242] Th\u00e9o Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2\u20130 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.[243]  The third place play-off was played on 17 December. The two teams had played against each other in their opening game in Group F which finished 0\u20130. Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol promptly scored for Croatia, with Achraf Dari equalising just 2 minutes later. Mislav Or\u0161i\u0107 scored the winner for Croatia as the match finished 2\u20131.\nQuestion:When is the final of the 2022 FIFA World Cup?\nAnswer:"

The consensus is \"all over the place,\" Munster said. Tesla delivered 6% more of its mainstay Model 3/Model Y vehicles in the first three months of this year than in the previous quarter.

What:\u00a0Date of Tesla Q4 and full year 2022 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast When:\u00a0Wednesday, January 25, 2023\nTesla's global production and sales results in the first quarter of 2022 did not disappoint. Deliveries reached another quarterly record, while the production was at a near-record level. That's outstanding news considering how challenging the global economy and automotive industry is in particular. In this post, we will take a look at the numbers and charts to visualize the progress and better understand what can be achieved in the near future. Let's get into details. Tesla increased its overall electric car production in Q1 by about 69% year-over-year to 305,407, just a few hundred units below the record of 305,407 set in Q4 2021. The lion's share falls on the Model 3/Model Y - over 291,000. Another bit of positive news is that the production of the refreshed Model S/Model X further increased compared to Q4. The preliminary sales result (customer deliveries) was at a record high of 310,048 (up 68% year-over-year). The Model 3/Y reached an all-time record, while the Model S/X pair improved towards the levels seen in the previous years. Q1 2022 (YOY change) \"In the first quarter, we produced over 305,000 vehicles and delivered over 310,000 vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.\" During the past four quarters, Tesla produced and delivered more than 1 million electric cars.\nCumulatively, more than 2.6 million Tesla cars were delivered. Considering that Tesla already produces the Tesla Model Y in two new plants - in Germany and in Texas - it seems very likely that Q2 and the following quarters also will bring new records.

(NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.\nThe world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (\u00a338.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government. Mr Musk tweeted \"the bird is freed\" and later said \"let the good times roll\". A number of top executives, including the boss, Parag Agrawal, have reportedly been fired. Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover.  The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as \"merger effective\". Allow Twitter content?

                "value": "Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.\nOct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted. But Musk provided little clarity on how he will achieve his goals.  read more Earlier this month, Musk brought the deal back on the table after previously trying to walk away from it. Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1\u00a0percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44\u00a0billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.\nOn May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and \"online harms\".[66] Musk secured another $7.1\u00a0billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[67][68] The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5\u00a0billion personal bank loan to $6.25\u00a0billion and his required cash equity contribution from $21\u00a0billion to just under $20\u00a0billion.[34][69] On May 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[70] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[71]  On May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5\u00a0percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[72] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10\u00a0percent.[73] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[74] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.\n50][51] Agrawal was set to receive $39\u00a0million from the buyout, while Dorsey would receive $978\u00a0million.[52] Musk had privately selected a new CEO to replace Agrawal upon completion of the acquisition,[35] though he was expected to serve as interim CEO in the months after its completion.[53] Tesla's stock sank by more than $125\u00a0billion the next market day, causing Musk to lose about $30\u00a0billion of his net worth.[54][55]  After the acceptance was announced, Musk said that his first goal would be to make the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed open-sourced, in an effort to increase transparency. He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[56] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[57][58] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[59] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[35] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[60] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[61][62] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[63] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[64][65]\nQuestion:How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?\nAnswer:"

For the first time since the 2019 tournament, attendance returned to full capacity with maximum of 40,000 spectators per day; the traditional par-3 contest also returned.[1][2]  Scottie Scheffler won his first major by three strokes over Rory McIlroy.[3][4] Scheffler had achieved his first PGA Tour win at the WM Phoenix Open two months earlier, and after also winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational and WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play he entered the Masters as world number one.[5]  Scheffler led by a record-tying five strokes after the second round, and held the lead from then on. His main challenger was Cameron Smith, who narrowed the lead to one stroke after the second hole of the final round. On the subsequent hole, Scheffler and Smith found themselves in the same tricky position, with Scheffler chipping in for a birdie, and Smith only managing a bogey, extending the lead to 3 strokes. Smith made a triple bogey on the 12th hole after his ball went into the water, leaving Scheffler relatively unchallenged for the rest of the round.\nScottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters on Sunday following a dominant performance at Augusta National.            The world No. 1 finished ahead of Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy to claim his first major title.            After two close-range misses on the 18th green, he rolled home the winning putt and carded a final round one-under par 71 to finish on 10-under for the tournament, three shots ahead of second-placed McIlroy.            Over the four days at the lush, sprawling golf club in Augusta, Georgia, Scheffler produced some excellent golf, refusing to falter under the pressure of being the tournament\u2019s leader for nearly three days.            In the end, he was rewarded for his recent run of good form, winning the most prestigious tournament title out there, as well as going home with the famous green jacket and the $2.7 million winners purse.            Asked how he felt in the immediate aftermath, Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty tired.\u201d           \u201cI want to go home! I\u2019m pretty tired right now \u2013 I\u2019m really at a loss for words right now,\u201d he said.           \u201cI can\u2019t thank my family enough \u2013 they\u2019ve made many sacrifices over the years. To have the honor of winning the tournament and to have my family with me was incredible.\u201d           The last two months have been transformative for Scheffler.\n11]  1.

She became the first home player to win an Australian Open singles title since Chris O'Neil in 1978. It was Barty's third major singles title, and she won the title without losing a set, dropping just three service games during the tournament.[1]  The final also marked Barty's last professional appearance, as she announced her retirement from the sport two months later.[2]  Naomi Osaka was the defending champion,[3] but lost to Amanda Anisimova in the third round.[4]  Barty retained the world No. 1 singles ranking after Aryna Sabalenka and Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 lost in the fourth round and quarterfinals, respectively. Collins entered the WTA top 10 rankings for the first time by reaching the final.[5]  Aliz\u00e9 Cornet reached her first major singles quarterfinal on her 63rd main-draw appearance, surpassing Tamarine Tanasugarn's all-time record, who reached her maiden quarterfinal at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships on her 45th attempt.[6] Kaia Kanepi becomes the first Estonian to reach the quarterfinals at all four majors after her victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round.\nThe 2022 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park, Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022.[2] It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.  The men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.\nFor the first time since 1997, neither Venus nor Serena Williams participated in the Australian Open.[7]  This was the last singles major for former world No. 4 and 2011 US Open champion Samantha Stosur, who announced her retirement from the discipline.[8] She lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round.

Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost.

Rybakina became the first Kazakhstani player to progress past the fourth round, and the first player since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to defeat three consecutive major champions in a single edition of the Australian Open.[2] By reaching the final, Rybakina made her debut in the top ten of the WTA Rankings.  Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion,[3] but she retired from professional tennis in March 2022.[4]  Barty's retirement and Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka\u2019s absences (both due to pregnancy) meant that Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin were the only former champions left in the draw.

PREVIEW (via Reuters) Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina began her Australian Open campaign on the outer courts at Melbourne Park but the 22nd seed is now just one step away from winning her second major, with only fellow big-hitter Aryna Sabalenka standing in her way. Russian-born Rybakina switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018 to get more financial support and went on to become the country\u2019s first major singles champion at the All England Club, where she beat Tunisian Ons Jabeur in the final. While that victory brought prestige and financial reward, it did not boost her up the rankings. The WTA stripped Wimbledon of ranking points for the tournament after organisers imposed a ban on Russian and Belarusian players due to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.

We have shared the winners of the Men\u2019s Singles and Doubles, Women\u2019s Singles and Doubles, and Mixed Doubles here, along with the details of the final scores. The 2023 Australian Open was held at Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The 111th edition of the Grand Slam tournament was held from 16\u201429 January 2023.\nNovak Djokovic defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, 6\u20133, 7\u20136(7\u20134), 7\u20136(7\u20135) to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2023 Australian Open. It was his record-extending tenth Australian Open title and 22nd major title overall, tying Rafael Nadal for the all-time record of most Grand Slam men's singles titles won.[1] He also became the second man to win double-digit titles at a single major, after Nadal at the French Open.[2] Djokovic lost just one set en route to the title (in the second round to Enzo Couacaud), and extended his match winning-streak at the Australian Open to an Open Era record 28 matches.  Nadal was the defending champion,[3] but lost in the second round to Mackenzie McDonald.[4]  Carlos Alcaraz, Casper Ruud, Tsitsipas and Djokovic were in contention for the ATP world No. 1 ranking at the beginning of the tournament. By winning the tournament, Djokovic claimed the top spot. Alcaraz, the incumbent world No. 1, withdrew from the tournament due to a right leg injury.[5][6]\nThe recent Australian Open winners were Rafael Nadal (Men's Singles) and Ashleigh Barty (Women's Singles). The tournaments were held in different parts of the country, such as Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, after which it was played in Melbourne Park Melbourne every year.\nAs in the previous major held a few months earlier, neither of the top two seeds advanced to the quarterfinals, with Nadal and Ruud both losing in the second round; this marked the first men's singles major since the 2002 Australian Open where the top two seeds lost prior to the third round.[7][8] Tsitsipas became the youngest finalist since Djokovic in 2011.[9] Tommy Paul became the first American man to reach the semifinals since Andy Roddick in 2009.[10]  With his win over Thanasi Kokkinakis in the longest match of his career, Andy Murray won a match from two sets down for a record eleventh time.[11]  Click on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.

It was held at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, from 22 May to 5 June 2022, comprising singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair tournaments are also scheduled. Novak Djokovic was the defending champion in men's singles, and Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 was the defending champion in the women's singles.[1] Neither successfully defended their title, with Djokovic losing in the quarter-finals to Rafael Nadal, and Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 losing in the first round to Diane Parry.  The event returned to its full spectator capacity after the last two editions due to COVID-19 restrictions in France. It was the 126th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of 2022. The main singles draws included 16 qualifiers for men and 16 for women out of 128 players in each draw. It was part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour. It was also the first edition of the tournament to feature a super tie break in the final set where the player would win first to ten points as rules are now applied in Wimbledon and US Open.[2]\nWith Rafael Nadal out through injury, the French Open 2023 could see a new name on the famous trophy in the men's draw \u2014 a trophy won by only four different players since 2004. Iga Swiatek,\u00a0Barbora Krejcikova and\u00a0Jelena Ostapenko are hoping to repeat their past triumphs in the women's singles when the action begins on May 28. Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka and men's world No.1 Carlos Alcaraz are among the players hoping to go all the way at Roland-Garros for the first time.

Rafael Nadal was the 2022 French Open champion, winning his 22nd and most recent grand slam title. Novak Djokovic ended Nadal's run of five straight French Opens in 2021 but the Spanish superstar returned to beat his arch-rival in four sets in the quarterfinals in last year. A brutal mid-match injury to Alexander Zverev sent Nadal through to a final he won in straight sets against Casper Ruud, extending his record to 14 French Open titles and 22 majors in total.\nIga \u015awi\u0105tek defeated Coco Gauff in the final, 6\u20131, 6\u20133 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2022 French Open.[1] It was her second French Open title, and she dropped just one set en route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, \u015awi\u0105tek extended her winning streak to 35 matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000 season.[2] \u015awi\u0105tek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in 2006.[3]  Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Je\u013cena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]  17-year-old Linda Noskov\u00e1 became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  The 2022 French Open women's final represented a moment for the sport that could be called a changing of the guard. While Iga Swiatek entered the final with a Grand Slam title in her trophy case already -- and on a 34-match winning streak -- the 21-year-old is still just coming into her own as one of the world's great players. She staked a dominant claim to that as she cruised to victory over Coco Gauff with a 6-1, 6-3 win in the final at Roland Garros in a match where she was almost never seriously challenged. \u00a0 Swiatek won the fall edition of the French Open in 2020 after it was postponed due to COVID-19 -- and she told NBC Sports after this win why taking home the trophy as the No. 1 player in the world is different than being a surprise winner and the lowest-ranked woman to ever win the event. \"I feel like two years ago I was pretty lucky that I could be there and basically I was living kind of in a bubble for two weeks,\" said Swiatek, the only Polish player to win a Grand Slam title. \"This time I felt the pressure. ...\nThis was the first Grand Slam tournament since the international governing bodies of tennis allowed players from Russia and Belarus to continue to participate in tennis events, but not compete under the name or flags of Russia and Belarus until further notice, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[3][4]  The men's singles title was won for the 14th time by Rafael Nadal, who won his 22nd Grand Slam title. He defeated eighth seed Casper Ruud, who was playing his first grand slam final, in straight sets. In winning the title, Nadal extended his record of most titles per tournament at the French Open, and also extended his all-time men's record of major singles titles to 22. The women's singles title was won by Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, who won her second French Open and second grand slam title, having won her first at the 2020 French Open. She defeated 18th seed Coco Gauff, who was also playing her first grand slam final, in straight sets. In winning the title, \u015awi\u0105tek became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova's win at the 2006 US Open.  As a Grand Slam tournament, the points for the French Open are the highest of all ATP and WTA tournaments.[5] These points determine the world ATP and WTA rankings for men's and women's competition, respectively.\nQuestion:Who won the women's singles French Open 2022?\nAnswer:"

Following Djokovic's quarterfinal loss and Zverev's semifinal retirement, Djokovic retained the No. 1 ranking at the end of the tournament. One week later, on 13 June 2022, when points from the previous year's tournament were dropped,[12] Medvedev reclaimed the top ranking, while Zverev reached into the new career high ranking of world No. 2, ending the Big Three's streak in the top 2 spots since 10 November 2003. Additionally, as Roger Federer did not enter the tournament, he fell outside of the top 50 in the ATP rankings for the first time since 5 June 2000.[13][14][15]  Stefanos Tsitsipas' fourth-round loss guaranteed a first-time French Open finalist from the bottom half of the draw, and Ruud became that finalist.[16] Holger Rune became the first Danish man to reach a major singles quarterfinal in the Open Era.[17]\nQuestion:Who won the men's singles French Open 2022?\nAnswer:"

It was his third French Open title and his record-breaking 23rd men's singles major title overall, surpassing the record he previously held jointly with Rafael Nadal.[1] With the victory, Djokovic became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.[2]  Nadal was the reigning champion,[3] but withdrew due to a left hip injury. This was the first time the 14-time champion missed the tournament since his debut in 2005.[4] With his withdrawal, Nadal fell out of the top 100 of the ATP rankings for the first time since 2003.[5]  By winning the title, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 singles ranking from Carlos Alcaraz; Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top ranking at the beginning of the tournament.[6][7] Medvedev's loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild in the first round marked the first time since 2000 that the second seed (then Pete Sampras) lost in the opening round.\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Novak Djokovic captured the 2023 French Open trophy by defeating Casper Ruud 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, 6-5 in the final, and he has now made Grand Slam history. The Serbian star has reached 23 major titles, passing Rafael Nadal for the men's record. Djokovic laid on the ground for a few seconds after his win, then stood up and took in the Roland Garros crowd -- one that included plenty of celebrities including Tom Brady, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kylian Mbappe. \"I was a 7-year-old dreaming that I could win Wimbledon and become No. 1 in the world one day,\" Djokovic said after the match. \"I'm beyond grateful and blessed to be standing here with so many incredible achievements. \"One thing is for sure I feel I had the power to create my own destiny. I try to visualize every single thing in my life, and not only believe it but really feel it with every cell in my body.\nDjokovic is 4-0 against Ruud, and the two last met in the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals in Italy, with the Serbian claiming a 7-5, 6-3 victory. Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major\u2014Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open\u2014at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year\u2014Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021. He has found the most success at the Australian Open, where he is a 10-time champion, and is considered one of the greatest hard-court players in the Open era with 13 hard-court major titles.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Forever raising the bar \ud83c\udfc6@DjokerNole masters Casper Ruud 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-5 to win a third Roland-Garros title and an unprecedented 23rd Grand Slam men\u2019s singles title.\u2070#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/9IfTi39alB Djokovic had tied Nadal on the Grand Slam list earlier this year after winning his 10th Australian Open. He is now tied with Serena Williams among men and women, and is just one shy of the overall record of 24 Grand Slam titles set by Margaret Court. \"I just want to send a message out there to every young person. Be in the present moment, forget about what happened in the past,\" Djokovic said. \"The future is something that is just going to happen. If you want a better future, you create it.\"\u00a0 Many congrats on this amazing achievement @DjokerNole 23 is a number that just a few years back was imposible to think about, and you made it! Enjoy it with your family and team! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb This was Djokovic's third French Open trophy, meaning he is now the only man to win all four Grand Slams at least three times. This also means he is retaking his spot as the No. 1 player in the world.\nThe first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker \u2014 as he often does \u2014 and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory. That allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors. Federer, who announced his retirement last year, is next among men with 20, while Djokovic\u2019s idol, Pete Sampras, is fourth with 14. And to think: Sampras set that mark by winning his last Slam in what turned out to be the last match of his career, the 2002 U.S. Open final. Here we are, just 21 years later, and not only did three guys surpass Sampras, but Djokovic moved way past him. Serena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era. Djokovic\u2019s win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals. The women\u2019s singles title in Paris was won on Saturday by Iga Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.\nQuestion:Who won the men's singles French Open 2023?\nAnswer:"

The popular Spaniard will not be competing in 2023 because he has undergone surgery on a hip problem, leading him to hint that 2024 will be his last in the sport. Elena Rybakina won her first grand slam title and became the first Kazakhstani to win a major when she recovered from a set down to beat Jabeur in the women's singles final. Tunisian Jabeur, who was aiming to become the first African or Arab to win a grand slam crown in the Open Era, was 14 places above Rybakina in the rankings. Simona Halep, champion in 2019, was Rybakina's victim in the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets to the player who would succeed the retired Ash Barty as champion. A post shared by Elena Rybakina \ud83d\udc20 (@lenarybakina)  Roger Federer is the most successful men's singles player at Wimbledon.

Medvedev was prohibited from playing due to his Russian nationality, while Zverev had an ankle injury.[13] This marked the first edition of Wimbledon since 1998 not to feature record eight-time champion Roger Federer, resulting in his dropping out of the ATP rankings for the first time since 1998.[14] Feliciano L\u00f3pez made his 81st main-draw major appearance, tying Federer's all-time record.[15] John Isner broke Ivo Karlovi\u0107's world record of 13,728 career aces on the ATP Tour in his third-round match against Jannik Sinner.[16]  All seeds per ATP rankings.[17][18]  Click on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.

It was his first Wimbledon title and second major singles title overall.[1]  Alcaraz, Djokovic, and Daniil Medvedev were in contention for the men's singles No. 1 ranking. Alcaraz retained the No. 1 ranking with his victory, [2][3] and became the first player to qualify for the year-end championships.[4]  For the first time since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002, the top seed and winner of the event was not a member of the Big Four. Stan Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career Grand Slam, but was defeated by Djokovic in the third round.  Djokovic's loss ended his third major bid to become the first man to win all four Grand Slam events in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969.

Djokovic\u00a0beat Jannik Sinner in the semifinals to set up a meeting with No.1 Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's final on Centre Court. Alcaraz overcame Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the last four.

Jabeur, meanwhile is the runner up at Wimbledon for a second straight year, and has lost all three of her career Grand Slam finals. Djokovic didn't walk away with a trophy, but the 23-time Grand Slam champion was still able to add more achievements to his already impressive resume at Wimbledon. With his second-round victory against Jordan Thompson, Djokovic became one of only three players in tennis history with 350 wins in Grand Slam singles matches -- joining Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal.\u00a0 After taking down No. 7 Andrey Rublev in Tuesday's quarterfinals, Djokovic reached a major semifinal for the 46th time in his career, tying Roger Federer's all-time men's record.\u00a0 This year's Wimbledon has had headlines that are not all about the game.

                "value": "While Swiatek is a heavy favorite and coming off a monumental season, there are a few others who finished 2022 on even hotter streaks that they will look to continue in the new year. Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week. Rune then beat Djokovic, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, to win the 1000-level title, his second title of the fall.\nShe is tied for third with Angelique Kerber among active players.

Per WTA Media, only Martina Navratilova (20) and Steffi Graf (17) produced bigger streaks against the top 10 in the last 40 years.\nThe 21-year-old has already won three major titles and firmly held onto the top ranking since Barty retired in April. As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.\n11] As of January 2022, \u015awi\u0105tek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of second-week progressions.[12] In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.[13][14]  In February, \u015awi\u0105tek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.[15]  At Indian Wells, \u015awi\u0105tek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth title.

It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered \u2014 outside of Poland, at least \u2014 for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women\u2019s player ever. Beware, though, after Poland\u2019s Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles title Saturday, beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek\u2019s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay.

This marked the second consecutive major where Cornet defeated a reigning major champion (following her victory over reigning French Open champion and world No. 1 \u015awi\u0105tek at Wimbledon).

He has dazzled crowds everywhere he has played during his first two years as a full-fledged professional, never more so than during the past two weeks of this unforgettable championship run. The ride began in 2021 in Australia, where he won his first main draw Grand Slam match on a court in the hinterlands of Melbourne Park with just a few dozen fans in attendance. He was outside the top 100 of the rankings then. In Croatia, last summer, he won his first tour-level title, and in New York starting a month later he blasted and drop-shotted his way into the quarterfinals as part of a teenage wave that took over the U.S. Open. This spring brought his first titles at the Masters level, just below the Grand Slams, in Miami Gardens, Fla., and Madrid, where he beat Nadal and Novak Djokovic in consecutive matches.\nQuestion:Who won the men's singles U.S. Open 2022?\nAnswer:"

The Hokies were led by first-year head coach Brent Pry. They played their home games at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The Hokies finished the 2021 season 6\u20137, 4\u20134 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Coastal division.[1] They received an invitation to the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl where they lost to Maryland 54\u201310.[2]  On November 16, 2021, the school fired head coach Justin Fuente after six years as head coach.[3] Assistant coach J. C. Price was named the interim coach and coached the Hokies in the Pinstripe Bowl.[4] On November 30, the school named Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry the team's new head coach.[5]  [7][8]  The game was canceled due to the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, which killed 3 players on Virginia's team. Roster Last update: 5/28/23\n64  BLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn\u2019t cutting it, nor were some of the players. It\u2019s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry, chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they\u2019re good enough to play at Virginia Tech. \u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid of hard conversations,\u201d Pry said. \u201cEverybody in here has weaknesses, including myself. It\u2019s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let\u2019s go work through them and strengthen them.\u201d In that spirit, here\u2019s a hard conversation for Hokies fans: This season could be a rough one. That\u2019s not a commentary on Pry\u2019s long-term viability as Tech\u2019s coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn\u2019t in a quick-fix situation.\nThe 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente\u2019s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what\u2019s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies\u2019 fallen standing in Virginia, Tech\u2019s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina\u2019s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.\nTo that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That\u2019s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry\u2019s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-\u201990s. Said Pry: \u201cWe have to hate losing and do anything to win.\u201d The Hokies don\u2019t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year\u2019s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.\nThe problem has always been that Virginia Tech\u2019s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech\u2019s \u201cTheory of Offense\u201d managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the \u201cold days\u201d of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It\u2019s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let\u2019s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.\nQuestion:Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?\nAnswer:"

The crypto conference took place June 9\u201312 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.\u00a0 Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia \u2014 the Wyoming-based digital asset bank \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. \u201cNew York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.\u201d Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful \u2014 a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace \u2014 told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. \u201cWe are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.\nMay 29 - 31, 2024 May 29 - 31, 2024 Austin, Texas \u00a0Austin, TX About Overview Who We Are 2023 Videos Participate Register Now Marketing Partnerships Terms Merchandise Sponsors Become a Sponsor Add two passes to your cart and enter code 2FOR1 at checkout.

Consensus is the world's largest, longest-running and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of the cryptocurrency, blockchain and Web3 community. From hard-hitting conversations with visionary speakers to hands-on workshops aimed at solving industry challenges, developers, investors, founders, brands, policymakers and more will walk away with the tools and insights needed to continue laying the foundation of a more decentralized future. It is called \u201cConsensus\u201d for a reason. This event is the primary forum where the industry comes together to discuss the most pivotal matters of the day, highlight the biggest successes and debate the most critical conversations. Consensus 2024 is your chance to be a part of the most important conversation in crypto and Web3.\r  Watch highlights from Consensus 2023! Consensus 2023 was the place for dealmaking as the ecosystem continues to mature. Very impressive. What I love about Consensus is that it\u2019s a place for people from all walks of life. You can connect with people from different age groups and professional backgrounds and that is so important.\nWhile the emergence and growth of Web3-focused projects are notable, it\u2019s also important to point out that current market conditions have been challenging for other key players. Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain \u2014 a cryptocurrency mining company \u2014 told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market.\u00a0 \u201cThere are only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,\u201d he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will receive loans. \u201cThey need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to machine purchases and bills they can\u2019t pay.\u201d Regulations were also heavily discussed at the conference. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the \u201cResponsible Financial Innovation Act,\u201d was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022. According to a statement, the bipartisan bill sponsored by senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, \u201caddresses CFTC and SEC jurisdiction, stablecoin regulation, banking, tax treatment of digital assets, and interagency coordination.\nSenator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is \u201cterrific,\u201d further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are \u201cbridgeable differences\u201d between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, \u201cThis is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.\u201d Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. \u201cThe Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.\nThis has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,\u201d he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall \u201cplumbing\u201d that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. \u201cWe need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,\u201d she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn\u2019t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn\u2019t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. \u201cI think as an industry, it\u2019s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.\u201d Finally, it\u2019s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction. As such, Verrilli aims to convince the U.S.\nQuestion:Where is Consensus 2022 taking place?\nAnswer:"

It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a 1+1\u20444 miles (2.0\u00a0km) Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.  The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80\u20131, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon.  Participation in the Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds.\nThe 2022 Kentucky Derby took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.

Zandon, leaving from the 10 post, opened as the 3-1 morning-line favorite after Derby post positions were released Monday, followed closely by Epicenter at 7-2 from the third position. Post time for Saturday's one and one-quarter mile race is 6:57 p.m. ET. In last year's edition of the Run for the Roses, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby win. However, the horse tested positive for a banned race-day substance and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission stripped Medina Spirit of his Derby title in February. With Medina Spirit's win vacated, second-place finisher Mandaloun improved to first place.

Its rich history, the high stakes, and its stature has made it one of the most prestigious horse races in the world. This importance makes the whole day an event in itself, with a number of traditions and festivities leading up to the race itself, starting two weeks before the race, with the Kentucky Derby Festival. The day starts with a \u201cdawn patrol\u201d, where the horses that will be racing are taken out for a morning workout. During this routine, the trainers and owners have a chance to see how their horses are feeling and make any last-minute adjustments to their strategy. A few races precede the Kentucky Derby, which is run in the late afternoon with the horses parading onto the track to the sound of \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home\u201d, the state anthem. The race itself is short, only lasting around two minutes, which is the reason why the race is known as \u201cThe Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports\u201d. Once the race ends, the winner is draped in a blanket of roses and presented with the coveted Kentucky Derby trophy. The purse, or prize, for the race will be $3 million. The 2023 Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023. The Kentucky Derby almost always takes place on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival, an annual festival held in the weeks preceding the day of the main race.\n14][15] The next three major races were held on April 2, with White Abarrio, Cyberknife, and Tiz the Bomb winning the Florida Derby, Arkansas Derby, and Jeff Ruby Steaks, respectively.[16] On April 9, the final day of major preps, Mo Donegal won the Wood Memorial, Zandon the Blue Grass, and Taiba the Santa Anita Derby.[17] While a Derby invitation is extended to the winner of the European and the Japan Road to the Derby, none of the top finishers from either circuit were nominated for the Triple Crown,[18] and the offers were not accepted.[2] The one Japanese horse who participated in the Derby, Crown Pride, did so by qualifying on the main Road.[19]  The field for the 2022 Kentucky Derby was considered to be one of the most competitive in recent memory, with no clear favorite in the weeks leading up to the race.[20][21][22][23] The morning line front runners were Zandon and Epicenter, with 3\u20131 and 7\u20132 odds respectively.[24] Zandon, the Blue Grass Stakes winner, had a 2\u20131\u20131 record (two wins, a second and a third-place finish) in four career starts and finished second in the Road to the Kentucky Derby with 114 points.\nQuestion:When did the 148th Kentucky Derby take place?\nAnswer:"

We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders\u2019 letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information. Yesterday, we posted\u00a0our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview\u00a0with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here\u2019s Tesla\u2019s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That\u2019s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.\nTesla, the EV manufacturer, generated a revenue of $16.93 billion in Q2 2022, a decrease of nearly 10% as compared to $18.76 billion in revenues in Q1 2022. Tesla generates its revenues from three segments: automotive sales, energy generation & storage, and services. In Q2 2022, the revenue from Automotive sales stood at $14,602 million (a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter), Energy generation and storage generated $866 million (a 32% decline quarter-over-quarter) in revenues, and revenues from the services segment amounted to $1,466 million (a 138% increase quarter-over-quarter). Tesla generates the majority of its revenues from its automotive business. In 2021, Tesla produced a total of 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. Automotive sales:  The automotive segment includes manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Automotive sales include production and deliveries of Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot or FSD features, and over-the-air software updates. These vehicle deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.  Automotive regulatory credits include sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Revenue from automotive regulatory credits are directly related to new vehicle production, sales, and pricing negotiated with the customers.\nToday after the bell American electric vehicle giant Tesla reported its first-quarter performance. The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.\u00a0 Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. \u201cOur own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,\u201d the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company\u2019s profit result stands out as it is by far the company\u2019s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and net income terms. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expected that Tesla would generate Q1 2022 revenues of $17.8 billion, and $2.26 in earnings per share.\nTesla beat on earnings and on revenue  Source: Predictions based on analysts' consensus from\u00a0Visible Alpha   Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported\u00a0Q1 FY 2022 earnings\u00a0results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Adjusted\u00a0earnings per share (EPS) beat estimates, rising 246.2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenue also came in above analyst forecasts, rising 80.5% year over year (YOY). Revenue growth was driven by vehicle deliveries, increased average selling prices, and growth in other areas of the company's business. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles in the quarter, which it reported earlier in the month and which came in below analysts' forecasts.   The company's shares rose more than 4% in extended trading. Over the past year, Tesla's shares have provided a\u00a0total return\u00a0of 35.8%, below the S&P 500's total return of 7.9%.   The number of vehicles produced by Tesla rose 69.4% YOY. Tesla's primary business is making electric vehicles, and it needs to continue expanding production in order to grow revenue and profits. The company recently opened new manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Germany. Tesla said that it recently began deliveries of the Model Y from its new factory in Austin, Texas. Production at its new Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg began last month.\nShares of the company are up around 4% in after-hours trading, after shedding nearly 5% of their value during regular trading. The company\u2019s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company\u2019s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin \u2014 that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla\u2019s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company\u2019s automotive business that stood out.  In contrast, Tesla\u2019s \u201cenergy generation and storage\u201d revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million \u2014 slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however. (Notably the company\u2019s solar deployments fell sharply in the quarter, and energy storage deployments, measured in megawatt hours, posted a gain from year-ago results, but a weaker total tally than quarters two, three and four saw last year.\nQuestion:What was Tesla's revenue in Q1 2022?\nAnswer:"

This means that Splatoon 3 development had not started as of July 2019 and presumably started after the release of Version 5.0.0 on 31 July 2019.[4] This is quite different compared to the timing of the development of Splatoon 2, which started immediately after Splatoon was released.  On 17 February 2021, Splatoon 3 was announced in a Nintendo Direct.  On 23 September 2021, more information was revealed about Splatoon 3 in a Nintendo Direct, including new special weapons, stages, and music, as well as the reveal of the single-player mode Return of the Mammalians.  On 1 January 2022, the @SplatoonJP Twitter account posted a Tweet for the arrival of 2022.

This revealed the return of the brush main weapon class, marking the final returning weapon class revealed.[5]\nSplatoon 3 will launch at midnight local time everywhere in the world, Nintendo has confirmed.

Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million\u2013a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6]  In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).\n15][16] The combined entity raised $125 million of new equity funding and received $350 million in credit led by JPMorgan.[17]  In December 2021, amid financial shortcomings following the merger, Jahm Najafi's Najafi Companies announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire STX Entertainment from ErosSTX for $173 million.[18] However, in late January 2022, Lionsgate also emerged as a potential suitor, looking to absorb either part or whole of STX, but the deal was later rejected, leaving only Najafi as a potential suitor.[19][20] In April 2022, Najafi Companies completed its acquisition of STX Entertainment. Eros Media World will retain a 15% non-voting stake in the company.[21][22] In July 2022, shortly after STX's motion picture chairman Adam Fogelson departed for the studio, Deadline reported that STX was in talks with Lionsgate over a potential film distribution deal.[23] Shortly after, it was reported that STX Entertainment's U.K. offices, including the London office housing STXinternational's headquarters, were gradually shutting down.[24] Following the departure of STXinternational head John Friedberg to join Black Bear Pictures' international division, it was announced the latter company was nearing a deal with STX to handle part of its slate internationally.\nBy Anthony D'Alessandro  Editorial Director/Box Office Editor Lionsgate is looking to absorb part of, or all of STX Entertainment, Deadline has learned from sources. STX was recently rescued back in early December from a draconian merger with Eros by Jahm Najafi\u2019s Phoenix-based The Najafi Companies for $173M. As Deadline first reported, that move by Najafi was an interim step on the way to a later, possibly bigger, transaction. It sounds like, Lionsgate is it. A key element of the agreement then was a \u201cgo-shop period,\u201d a 45-day span during which the board of directors of ErosSTX, with the assistance of its financial advisor, Lazard, could solicit alternative proposals from third parties. Reportedly there are other suitors in the mix for the STX assets which include Jennifer Lopez\u2019s highest grossing live-action domestic movie, Hustlers\u00a0($105M) and the\u00a0Bad Moms\u00a0comedy franchise.              \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tAcquisitions \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternational Insider: Lionsgate Buys eOne; On Location, Location, Locarno; Anger In Israel; Barbie Keeps Soaring\t\t \t\t\t                \tExecutives \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tEntertainment One's Steve Bertram Reflects On \"Incredible Ride\" As He & Michael Lombardo Set Exits Following Lionsgate Acquisition\nRobert Simonds will serve as STX chairman, and currently president Noah Fogelson will become the new CEO. Adam Fogelson will continue to serve as chairman of the Motion Picture Group, Andrew Warren will continue as chief financial officer, and John Friedberg will continue overseeing the international and acquisitions divisions for the Motion Picture Group out of the company\u2019s London office. Friday\u2019s transaction puts STX in a position to further develop, market and distribute content globally through multiple distribution channels including theatrical releases, international and direct-to-streaming services, as well as video-on-demand. STX is pivoting away from what originally was conceived as 12 theatrical releases annually. The studio now is planning 15 films a year, with five destined for the big screen and the balance split between straight-to-streaming or international theatrically distributed PVOD or direct-to-streaming titles. Like other studios, STX pivoted during the pandemic, with either hybrid theatrical releases or licensing lucratively straight to streaming. STX sent Greenland\u00a0to PVOD stateside, skipped theatrical (when New York and Los Angeles cinemas were closed) and sold streaming to HBO Max\u00a0on that Gerard Butler movie in summer 2020. It licensed what was to be a theatrical release, My Spy, to Amazon. It did handle\u00a0The Mauritanian, which won a Golden Globe.            Recently, STX sold The Contractor to Showtime and Queenpins to Paramount+.\nIt was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[7] The Wall Street Journal stated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[7][8] In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[9]  STX called off its IPO in October 2018, citing the China\u2013U.S. trade war, and conditions having deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in the mainland Chinese equity market.[10]  An overall co-funding agreement with Chinese company Huayi Brothers Media lapsed at the end of 2018,[11] and in April 2019, co-founder Bill McGlashan was fired due to his being indicted in the college admissions bribery scandal.[12]  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian film and television studio Eros International plc. Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] The merger was closed on July 30, 2020;[14] the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September.\nQuestion:Who acquired STX Entertainment?\nAnswer:"

Hatch\u2014the Chairman Emeritus of the Hatch Foundation, former President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and longest-serving Senator in Utah history (1977-2019). Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator\u2019s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:\u00a0 \u201cSenator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,\u201d said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. \u201cBorn the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life\u2019s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others\u2014and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day. Senator Hatch touched the hearts of countless individuals, and I know I speak for all of them when I say he will be dearly missed.\nFormer Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who served in the Senate from 1977 through 2019 and who retired as president pro tempore as the most senior member of his party, died Saturday at age 88. Hatch was among the most accomplished legislators of his generation, with his last legacy item an overhaul of the tax system when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Hatch announced he would not seek reelection on Jan. 2, 2018, less than two weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed the tax bill that Hatch helped spearhead. \u201cWhen the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter,\u201d Hatch said in a statement announcing his retirement. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching.\u201d Hatch stepped aside with the hope and expectation that Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts, would succeed him in the Senate, with the thinking being that Romney\u2019s national profile would help blunt the loss of decades of Senate seniority. [Orrin Hatch Prepares for His Senate Exit] Born in Pittsburgh, Pa., Hatch grew up in poverty.\nFormer Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in US history, died in Salt Lake City on Saturday at the age of 88.           Hatch, the former Senate president pro tempore, served in the chamber for 42 years from 1977 to 2019. The Hatch Foundation confirmed his death in a release, which did not include a cause.           \u201cA man of wisdom, kindness, character, and compassion, Orrin G. Hatch was everything a United States Senator should be,\u201d said A. Scott Anderson, chairman of the Hatch Foundation. \u201cHe exemplified a generation of lawmakers brought up on the principles of comity and compromise, and he embodied those principles better than anyone. In a nation divided, Orrin Hatch helped show us a better way by forging meaningful friendships on both sides of the aisle.\u201d            An ardent conservative, Hatch favored corporate tax cuts, limited government, deregulation and military spending during his time in office. He consistently voted against gay rights, abortion and stricter gun laws; he reached across the aisle on issues including AIDs education and stem cell research as well as the DREAM Act.         As the ranking Republican on the Senate finance committee, Hatch ushered in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act during the Trump administration, which was lauded as the biggest tax code change in three decades and criticized for favoring corporations and the wealthy.\n163] In a 1996 interview on 60 Minutes, Hatch said he wears a mezuzah necklace in order to remind himself that another Holocaust should never be allowed to occur.[164]  Despite their political differences, Hatch was a longtime friend of fellow senator Ted Kennedy,[165] spoke at his memorial service in 2009,[166] and publicly suggested Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie, as a replacement for Kennedy in the Senate.[167]  Hatch died in Salt Lake City on April 23, 2022, aged 88, from complications of a stroke he had the week prior.[1][168] He was buried in Newton.[169]  Hatch played the piano, violin, and organ. Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many artists. One of his songs, \"Unspoken\", went platinum after appearing on WOW Hits 2005, a compilation of Christian pop music.[170]  He co-authored \"Everything And More\", sung by Billy Gilman. In addition to serving as a United States senator, Hatch earned over $10,000 as an LDS musical recording artist.[171]  Rock musician Frank Zappa composed a guitar instrumental entitled \"Orrin Hatch On Skis\", which appears on his 1988 album, Guitar.[172]  In March 1997, Hatch and Janice Kapp Perry jointly recorded an album with Tree Music entitled My God Is Love.\nHe was first elected in 1976 and\u00a0announced his retirement\u00a0in January 2018.

And for me that time is soon approaching.\" Hatch was born in Homestead Park, Pennsylvania, in 1934. Raised in what he's called \"a ramshackle house\" during the Great Depression, Hatch went on to serve as chairman of three different Senate committees and put his stamp on major pieces of legislation across the policy spectrum. Hatch graduated from Brigham Young University in 1959 with a bachelor's in history, and in 1969 moved to Utah. He is survived by his wife, Elaine, and their six children. Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date, the Hatch Foundation said. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox tweeted that \"Utah mourns with the Hatch family.\" \"This breaks my heart. Abby and I are so grateful for the opportunities we had to spend time with this incredible public servant. He was always so kind and generous with his time and wisdom,\" Cox, a Republican, wrote.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  This week brought news of the death of CNN founding anchor Bernard Shaw, known for pursuing the news and avoiding flash. And in recent days, CNN's new leader has made moves that he says will return the cable channel closer to its news-driven roots. Some of his changes have sparked concerns inside and outside the network. And for more on that, we have NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hey, David.DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK. So tell us, who is CNN's new CEO and chairman Chris Licht, and how does he want to reshape CNN exactly?FOLKENFLIK: Sure. Chris Licht came over after stints at CBS where he oversaw the Colbert \"Late Show.\" And he had also been at CBS News, and before that, MSNBC. He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era. This has been a passion of Discovery CEO David Zaslav and Discovery's biggest investor, John Malone. Let's not forget that they just took over Time Warner and CNN recently.\nIn the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company\u2019s commercial activities.           \u201cWe have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,\u201d Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. \u201cWe are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.\u201d           Licht\u2019s brief and rocky tenure as the head of the network came after he found tremendous success in morning news, producing MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d before he revamped \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d           Most recently, before joining CNN, Licht led Colbert\u2019s program while it became the highest-rated late-night show on television.           Licht was never able to recreate that magic at CNN, stumbling soon after taking the job and facing enormous criticism.           Licht\u2019s first task was dismantling CNN+, which had been hailed by CNN\u2019s previous leadership as the network\u2019s streaming future. Staffers knew that the decision to axe the streamer wasn\u2019t Licht\u2019s own decision, but, nevertheless, the shuttering of the much-hyped service dealt him a difficult opening hand.           Employees, however, kept an open mind.\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics                  newsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere\u00a0else. Thank you.

David Bauder, Associated Press                       David Bauder, Associated Press                   Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CNN ousted chief executive Chris Licht after a tumultuous year leading the struggling news network that culminated in a damning magazine profile and the growing realization that he\u2019d lost the confidence of the network\u2019s journalists. The change was announced at CNN\u2019s editorial meeting Wednesday morning and came just two days after Licht said he would \u201cfight like hell\u201d to earn the trust of those around him. WATCH: CNN town hall highlights media\u2019s struggle with how to cover Trump and his lies David Zaslav, CEO of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, appointed a four-person interim leadership team, and said at the editorial meeting that he would conduct a thorough search for Licht\u2019s replacement. Licht had a mandate to try and make CNN more palatable to both sides of the country\u2019s political divide; Republicans had become increasingly suspicious of the network following repeated attacks by former President Donald Trump. But some at the network saw Licht\u2019s mandate for change as a repudiation of their past work, and a live town hall interview with Trump last month drew widespread criticism.\nDiscovery head of streaming JB Perrette and now-CNN Chief Operating Officer David Leavy, were skeptical of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on niche or half-baked content ideas like \"Jake Tapper's Book Club\" and \"Parental Guidance with Anderson Cooper.\" Leavy is now part of the executive team that will help Zaslav find a new CEO. Zaslav thought CNN+ was a waste of resources for a company saddled with $50 billion of debt that needed to boost free cash flow and generate $3 billion in merger-related synergies. But before he made any decisions, he wanted to hear Licht's thoughts. Licht was supposed to begin his job May 2, 2022, but he started a few weeks early to weigh in on CNN+. In several virtual conferences, he met with CNN+ head Andrew Morse, CNN+ general manager Alex MacCallum and CNN Chief Tech Officer Robyn Peterson, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the talks. Perrette and Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting. The discussion centered around the viability of offering a product named after CNN without actually featuring a live feed of the network's cable programming. Perrette told the CNN+ leadership to pause all marketing spending and not to launch on Roku.\nOn Wednesday morning, Licht was informed that he was being relieved of his duties as CNN\u2019s top executive, a person familiar with the matter said. The top two leaders of CNN\u2019s communications department, Kris Coratti Kelly and Matt Dornic, as well as Licht\u2019s chief of staff, Devan Cayea, will also depart the company, the person said.

But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced \u201ctwo weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods\u201d to prevent her win, and she said that \u201ctonight\u2019s result represents in itself a resounding victory.\u201d Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France\u2019s presidential election runoff Sunday\u2019s result marked the far right\u2019s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen\u2019s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron\u2019s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France\u2019s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. \u201cThe result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],\u201d said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. \u201cShe ended up very far from power.\n61][62][63]  On 14 April 2022, Le Pen said if elected she would hold a referendum on whether to reinstate capital punishment in France, if such a proposal garnered enough signatures under the  citizens' initiative referendum system she wants to implement.[70][71] Le Pen had also campaigned for a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves in public.[72][73]  On 20 April, the only election debate of the campaign (moderated by L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9 and Gilles Bouleau) to feature both major candidates was held. Polls conducted after the debate to ascertain which candidate performed best, showed that 59% of viewers thought that Macron had performed better, compared to 39% for Le Pen.[74][75]  The trendlines below are constructed using local regressions.[76]      Macron was re-elected with 58.55% of the vote to 41.45% for Le Pen in the second round of the election.[77] Exit poll projections by Ipsos and Sopra Steria for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and Radio France, released as voting closed, estimated that Macron defeated Le Pen with 58.2% of the vote to 41.8%.[78] He became the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002.\nQuestion:Who won the French Presidential Election 2022?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "With iPhone 14 Pro, we\u2019re entering the 48 megapixel era of iPhone photography. If it was mere detail or pixels, it would mark a step towards the cameras from the Radio Shack ad.  But what Apple has delivered in the iPhone 14 Pro is a camera that performs in all ways closer to a \u2018proper\u2019 camera than any phone ever has. At times, it can capture images that truly render unlike a phone camera \u2014\u00a0instead, they are what I would consider a real photo, not from a phone, but from a camera.  That\u2019s a huge leap for all of us with an iPhone in our pocket.  Begin typing your search above and press return to search.   Press Esc to cancel.\nOne of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an \u201cadvanced quad-pixel sensor.\u201d However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible \u2013 allowing for impressive crops and edits \u2013 using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that\u2019s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says \u201cwith a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.\u201d Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera \u2013 Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.\nThe trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of \u2018sub-pixels\u2019 can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sensors look like this: Every \u2018pixel\u2019 essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally \u2018mosaicked\u2019 pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as \u2018Quad Bayer\u2019.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to \u2018de-mosaic\u2019 this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four \u2018super subpixels\u2019 of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.\nThis is our deep dive into iPhone 14 Pro \u2014 not the phone, the iPod, or the internet communicator \u2014\u00a0but the camera.  We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone\u2019s eye first was the opener of Apple\u2019s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone\u2019s recognizable screen cutout or \u2018notch\u2019 had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic \u2018island\u2019. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What\u2019s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first \u2014\u00a0and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well \u2014\u00a0the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.\nLux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations. At a now-legendary keynote, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was launching a widescreen iPod, a phone and an internet communications device. These three devices were not separate new products, he revealed \u2014\u00a0they were all functions of a revolutionary new device: the iPhone. If introduced today, we\u2019d find a conspicuous absence in that lineup: a groundbreaking new camera. It was not one of the devices he mentioned, and for good reason: The iPhone launched with a 2-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter. There was no pretense about this replacing your camera for taking photos.  Fast forward to today, and the main feature-point of most smartphone launches is, of course, their cameras. Plural. In the time since the iPhone launched, it has gone through small steps and big leaps and from a single fixed-focus camera to an entire complex array of cameras.  Evolution. #iPhone14 pic.twitter.com/8A7JUTQdcl With iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made a huge change to its entire camera system \u2014\u00a0and yet, it seems many reviewers and publications cannot agree on whether it is a small step or a huge leap.  At Lux, we make a camera app. We have been taking thousands of iPhone photos every month since we launched our app five years ago, and we know a thing or two about smartphone cameras.\nQuestion:What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?\nAnswer:"

It is $49 for one week and only one week \u2014  or in practice, probably not quite even that.\r Instead, you have to drop the kit off at a UPS store \"by day 7.\" If you fail to do so, \"you will be charged a fee and a tax,\" though Apple does not specify how much that will amount to.\r It does say that at point of rental, it will put a temporary authorization on your credit card to cover the full replacement value of the tools. Again, Apple does not say how much that is \u2014  partly because it varies, there are customized repair toolkits for different models.\r Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\r However, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit \u2014  the smallest kit available \u2014  then the kit's contents are worth around $914.\nUnless you want to cheat and use the cases\u2019 wheels, which I\u2019m thrilled to report\u00a0don\u2019t cost $700 extra. What\u2019s inside these beefy kits? The first case for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 repairs includes a \u201cHeated Display Removal Fixture\u201d and a \u201cHeated Display Pocket,\u201d a pair of technical devices that would cost roughly $350 to buy separately. In the other case are various parts, including battery and display presses, a repair tray, torque drivers, screw bits, and adhesive covers. You can find a full list in the Q&A section of the Tool Kit Rental page.  But what if I just need one torque driver, and I don\u2019t want to buy it to keep? I guess I\u2019ll have to hit the gym so I can carry all of that extra gear. In all seriousness, I\u2019m eager to see what\u2019s included in the rental kits for Mac repairs once Apple adds laptops and desktops to its self-service repair program later this year. Heft aside, the rental service seems like a legitimately great way to save money on genuine components most people don\u2019t have in their toolbox. If only you could rent just the specific tools you need individually, too. And if only Apple\u2019s new right-to-repair initiative supported older iPhone models\u2014you know, the ones most in need of repairs or replacement parts.\nApple\u2019s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools\u2014some of which are proprietary. With the \u201cSelf Service Repair Store\u201d opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you\u2019re making, but there\u2019s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you\u2019ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged \u201ca fee and a tax\u201d via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall. It\u2019s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.\nConfusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\rHowever, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit \u2014  the smallest kit available \u2014  then the kit's contents are worth around $914. For all other iPhone models available, the second case adds about $364, for a total on your credit card of $1,278.\rNote that the kit costs the same, and has the same tools, whether you want the tools to replace a battery or fix the speaker. So if you're on a low income, a tight budget, and figured this was a way to fix your iPhone cheaply, then it probably isn't.\rIt's also not in any possible way a straightforward job. And if the severe warnings throughout the documentation don't put you off, the toolkit cases might.\rThe iPhone SE toolkit comes in one case, where all of the other iPhones in the program get a two-case kit instead. The case you get for the iPhone SE contains:\rBattery press Display Press 4.7-inch Repair Tray Adhesive Cutter Nylon Probe (Black Stick) 4.7-inch Display Protective Cover 4.7-inch Back Protective Cover Black Torque Driver Kit Gray Torque Driver\nGreen Torque Driver Blue Torque Driver Micro Stix Bit Super screw Bit 4.7-inch Support Frame Universal Display Fixture Every iPhone repair toolkit, regardless of the model, comes with a case containing these tools. Except for the iPhone SE, all of the rest have a case that adds:\r Heated Display Removal Fixture Heated Display Pocket  Apple says that, \"one case weighs 43 pounds and the other weighs 36 pounds.\"\rThat's a total weight of 79 pounds. As an iPhone SE weighs only 5.09 ounces, that means to repair it you need a kit that weighs just over 248 times more than the phone you're trying to fix.\rThe toolkits come on wheels, and they can also be stacked. If your iPhone needs two toolkits, and you stack them together, they add up to 20 inches wide and 47 inches high.\rRight to Repair was always a campaign about how individuals should have the rights, and the facilities, to effect repairs on the devices they have bought, and these kits are versions of what Apple uses in-store. They're just not cost-effective for any given user, skilled or not. Even before it launched its new Self Service Repair program, Apple was accused of doing it less to help users, and more to head off future legislation.\nQuestion:How much does it cost to rent a tool kit for Apple device repairs?\nAnswer:"

The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022 NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April\u2013June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.  Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021\u201322 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding.\nThe 2021-22 NBA Finals are set to begin on Thursday, June 2 between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics. The full NBA Finals schedule is below. To view the postseason bracket, visit Yahoo Sports' NBA scoreboard page.

Per BetMGM, the betting favorite to win the 2021-22 NBA championship are the Warriors at -160 followed by the Celtics (+125), as of May 29. The top six seeds in each conference were determined at the conclusion of the regular season. The final two seeds were determined through the play-in tournament.\nThe 2022 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2021\u201322 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics in six games, winning their fourth championship in eight years. Golden State's Stephen Curry was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the first time in his career.  The 3-seeded Warriors (53\u201329) had home-court advantage in the series based on having the better regular-season record than the 2-seeded Celtics (51\u201331). This is the 11th time that a lower-seeded team had home-court advantage, the last time being 2019.[1] It is also the second straight finals without a no. 1 seed from either conference, as well as the 15th time overall.[2][3] The Celtics won the opening game on the road and returned to Boston with the series tied 1\u20131. They won their first home game to take a 2\u20131 lead, but the Warriors won the next three games to take the series 4\u20132. Golden State won their first title since 2018 and their seventh championship overall, while Boston remained tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most titles in league history with 17.[4]\nAll rounds were best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.  On March 9, 2022, the Phoenix Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[13]  On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15]  Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12\u201315.\nThe NBA Finals returned to its normal June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began.[5] The series started on June 2 and concluded on June 16. Sponsored by the streaming service YouTube TV, the series was officially known as the 2022 NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV.[6] This edition of the Finals was a rematch of the 1964 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then-San Francisco Warriors in five games.[7]  During the 2021 offseason, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens president of basketball operations, replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[8] Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, a 2021 first-round pick, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for Al Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[9] Needing a replacement for Stevens, Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Ime Udoka was hired as the new head coach. After starting the season 16\u201319 and in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics finished the regular season with a record of 51\u201331, winning 35 of their final 47 games to finish with the second-best record in the conference.[10]\nQuestion:Which teams are playing in the 2021-22 NBA Finals?\nAnswer:"

Let\u2019s check out everything there is to know about Overwatch 2 including its 5v5 switch, tank changes, maps, heroes & more. Overwatch has become one of the globe\u2019s most beloved FPS titles. Packed to the brim with awesome characters, beautiful maps, and accompanied by a vibrant esports scene, Blizzard\u2019s flagship FPS has cemented its place in gaming history. Therefore, when it was announced at Blizzcon 2019 that there was going to be a sequel, fans went wild. While it\u2019s been a long journey to the eventual release, pieces are finally starting to fall into place. From a release date to a look at the new heroes, here\u2019s everything we know about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the \u2018early access\u2019 label. Since the game\u2019s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event. Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled.\nOverwatch 2. Credit: Blizzard Entertainment Overwatch 2 will launch October 4 on Nintendo Switch, PS5/PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows PC. It will also be free-to play, though there is a caveat here. This is only the PvP portion of the game, and it will be early access at launch. PvE is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2023. \u00a0 Overwatch 2. Credit: Blizzard Way back at BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard revealed that Overwatch 2 was still early in development and that no firm release date was planned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea,\u201d former game director Jeff Kaplan said at the reveal panel when asked when the game would arrive. \u201cLike, just let us make it great, that\u2019s what we care about more than anything. We don\u2019t have a date in mind.\u201d Back then, it was largely assumed the game would land in 2021 \u2013 there was a playable vertical slice at BlizzCon 2019, after all \u2013 but recent events within Activision Blizzard eliminated any chance of the game launching soon. In a February 2021 financial call Activision Blizzard CFO, Dennis Durkin, said the company\u2019s outlook \u201cdoes not include\u201d Overwatch 2 releasing in 2021.\n16] At least three new heroes were announced to be added to the roster, including Sojourn, a Canadian Overwatch officer, Junker Queen, the ruler of Junkertown, and Kiriko, the protector of Kanezaka.[17][18]  Overwatch 2 runs on an upgraded version of the original game's engine which allows for larger map sizes to better support the new story-based player versus environment (PvE) elements.[12] Additionally, all of the existing heroes received visual redesigns for Overwatch 2, although Blizzard did not expect every hero to have their redesigns finished when the game launched. Twelve of the existing 31 redesigns were completed at the time of Overwatch 2's reveal.[17]  Overwatch 2 was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[18] Kaplan stated when the game was announced that they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022 release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for \"giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch\".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.\nAll you need to know about the arrival of Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has finally landed, following the original Overwatch shutting down. The highly anticipated sequel has brought significant changes to the game, including a free-to-play model, a sizeable team update, a whole bunch of new heroes, and much more. Those who pre-loaded the game will have already got themselves well acquainted with the new and improved features, but if you're only just getting that battle pass loaded, or want to gain a better understanding of just how you can make the most of Overwatch 2, read on. The Overwatch 2 release date was 4th October 2o22, as developers confirmed well in advance. Although the game is free-to-play, players also have the option to buy the Watchpoint Pack for \u00a334.99 - it's available on the Xbox, PlayStation and Battle.net websites - if they want to secure some special skins, in-game currency and more. Read more on Overwatch 2: The UK launch time for Overwatch 2 was 8pm BST on 4th October, the developers from Blizzard confirmed ahead of time. Players in Britain should've been able able to jump into the new game during the evening on Tuesday, then, although there was apparently quite a lot of strain on the servers.\nThese missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass bundle.[11]  Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch, so that players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch, explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14] However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.\nQuestion:When was Overwatch 2 released?\nAnswer:"

But the Australian kept himself in contention, catching and then passing Bettiol while cresting the summit to win the stage\u2014almost five years to the day after taking his last Tour de France stage victory. Bettiol finished second, and France\u2019s Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) was third. Who\u2019s Really Winning the Tour?\nSo tomorrow, all eyes will be\u2013again\u2013on the Tour\u2019s top-2 riders, with one day left for Vingegaard to solidify his lead before the time trial, and one day left for Poga\u010dar to get close enough to give himself a chance of winning a third consecutive Tour de France. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Denmark\u2019s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) survived the first of three days in the Pyrenees to hold on to the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France. The 25-year-old finished safely in a small group of GC contenders and their teammates in Foix at the end of Stage 16, maintaining his 2:22 advantage over Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending champion. After getting gapped on the final climb of the stage, Great Britain\u2019s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) managed to rejoin the group of favorites on the long road down to the finish. He remains third overall, 2:43 behind Vingegaard on the Tour\u2019s General Classification. It was a bigger day for Canada and Israel-Premier-Tech, though as Canadian Hugo Houle won the stage and his teammate and compatriot, Michael Woods, finished third.\nWith three days left in the 2022 Tour de France, Vingegaard looks assured of standing on the top step of the podium in Paris. Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday\u2019s 40km individual time trial, the Dane\u2019s lead is too much for Poga\u010dar to overcome. Poga\u010dar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour\u2019s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour\u2019s better time trialists, and there\u2019s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour\u2019s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour\u2019s King of Mountains competition. He won\u2019t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he\u2019s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins. And with two more stages expected to end in sprints and a long time trial on Saturday\u2013all of which suit van Aert\u2013the team\u2019s tally could increase. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour?\nAlthough the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d wasn\u2019t.  Maybe Rogli\u010d (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn\u2019t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June\u2019s Criterium du Dauphin\u00e9, the fact that he wasn\u2019t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team\u2019s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There\u2019s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today\u2019s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in S\u00f8nderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland\u2019s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019.\nThe Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour\u2019s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium\u2019s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia\u2019s Tadej Poga\u010dar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian\u2019s talents, so there\u2019s a good chance that he\u2019ll hold the Tour\u2019s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who\u2019s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour\u2019s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia\u2019s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who\u2019s Winning the Tour? Belgium\u2019s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Tour de France?\nAnswer:"

A lot of eyes are on Apple as concerns mount over an economic downturn in the United States. Here\u2019s what the company reported today.  For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison\u2019s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.  Apple no longer reports unit sales for any of its products but instead reports a breakdown of revenue by product category.\nAnswer:"

AWS segment sales for Q3 2022 increased 27 percent year-over-year to $20.5 billion, from $16.5 billion in Q3 2021. AWS\u2019 operating income was $5.4 billion, compared with an operating income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter 2021. Sales were up from the previous quarter this year, but income was down slightly. Q2 2022 saw AWS post net sales of $19.7 billion for the quarter, and operating income of $5.7 billion. Q1 2022 sales and income were $18.44 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. The cloud giant looks likely to reach sales of $80 billion by the end of the next quarter. As a whole, the company saw Net sales increase 15 percent to $127.1 billion in the third quarter. Operating income decreased to $2.5 billion. The company saw $4.9 billion of operating income in third quarter 2021. Net income decreased to $2.9 billion.\n2% in Q2 FY 2020. Revenue growth climbed as high as 43.8% YOY in Q1 FY 2021, but since that time it has decelerated sharply. It slowed to 27.2% for Q2 FY 2021 and as low as 7.3% YOY by Q1 FY 2022. Analysts estimate that Amazon's revenue growth will continue to slow to a pace of just 5.3% YOY for Q2 FY 2022. This is the smallest quarterly revenue growth the company has experienced in at least four and a half years.   Source: Visible Alpha   As mentioned above, investors will also focus on revenue generated by AWS, Amazon's cloud-computing platform. AWS offers developers a range of on-demand technology services, such as compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. These services are primarily used by start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. The company's AWS business generates much higher margins than its\u00a0e-commerce\u00a0business. In FY 2021,\u00a0Amazon's\u00a0global retail sales- and subscription-based business segments generated about 87.5% of the company's total revenue while AWS accounted for a mere 12.5%. However, AWS accounted for 63.3% of total operating income for the year, making it Amazon's main profit generator.\nAmazon said its cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted 33 percent increase in its revenue to $19.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022.  AWS has generated operating income of $5.71 billion in Q2. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008 resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon\u2019s cloud services rather than build their own data centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue would jump on demand for its cloud services. Log in to leave a comment   Hey there!

By      Eddie Makuch    on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022 release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of Aionios, a \"vast and sublime natural world.\" The video also spotlights some of the game's battle system.\nBen Johnson                   Published: Jul 29, 2022  Xenoblade Chronicles 3, developed by Monolith Soft, is out now\u00a0on the Nintendo Switch. This is the fourth instalment in the much-loved Xenoblade series, and the trailer showcases lush landscapes, giant mechons, and grand drama. We love the game, as we explain in our\u00a0Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review, so be sure to check\u00a0it out\u00a0if you\u2019re interested.   With the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 release date set for July 29, it means the game is out now.\u00a0It\u2019s a bit of a blend of the two previous mainline entries, which could have interesting story implications. To learn more about the possibilities, check out our\u00a0Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah,\u00a0Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Mio, or\u00a0Xenoblade Chronicles 3 characters\u00a0guides to see what\u2019s going on.    The last game in the series, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, came out back in 2017, the launch year for the Nintendo Switch. In terms of sales, it was very successful and was followed by a remaster of the original Xenoblade.\u00a0Check out our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 trailers page to see if you can spot any clues as to how the stories tie together.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3[b] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and concludes the trilogy's narrative.   The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.\n43] It was also the bestselling physical game during its first week of release in the UK, where it had the biggest launch for the entire Xeno franchise in terms of copies sold.[44] As of March 2023, it has sold 1.86 million copies.[45]  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 received multiple end-of-year accolades, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations at the New York Game Awards,[46] Golden Joystick Awards, and The Game Awards. At IGN's \"Best of 2022\" awards, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 won the category of \"Best RPG\".[47]\n31] Game Informer felt the world didn't have enough to do, and all of the biomes seemed to blend into each other at a certain point, \"Beyond challenging monsters, collecting respawnable drops, and recruiting heroes at Keves or Agnus settlements, there's not much to do or see.\"[28]  PCMag wrote that the Switch seemed unable to keep up with the game's large vistas and combat, \"here are noticeable resolution drops and object pop-in abounds. The frame rate isn't particularly steady, either, and the game can chug at times.\"[41] Eurogamer praised the game for capturing the sense of freedom found in older JRPGs, \"the sensation of running through endless fields of long grass with your companions, facing impossible odds with a spring in your step.\"[30] Polygon liked the new optional content, feeling it was some of the series' best, \"There are well over 100 side quests, and though their objectives could be rote, each told me something about how one lives in this world. It made me care about Aionios as an amalgamation of the land and its peoples.\"[42]  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was the bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 112,728 physical copies being sold.\nQuestion:when was xenoblade chronicles 3 released?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Nope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the \u201cpet\u201d chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker\u2019s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy\u2019s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal \u2014 Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket \u2014 foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family\u2019s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because \u201che has mouths to feed.\u201d  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.\nWho's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger adventure than I\u2019ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.\u201d Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers\u2019 expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.\n(Keith David), killed in a freak accident in which debris rained down from the sky, they\u2019re running into hard times. Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don\u2019t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood\u2019s character is Peele\u2019s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey\u2019s identity, which is sort of Nope\u2019s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that \u201csince the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.\u201d But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter\u2019s Claim, and OJ\u2019s been selling horses to owner Ricky \u201cJupe\u201d Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter\u2019s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western \u2014 and those in turn, let\u2019s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West.\nProfessor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele\u2019s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family\u2019s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying \u201cnope\u201d in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses \u2014 including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals\u2019 work in films, including in Nope itself.\nAdvertisement Supported by Is the rider in the 19th-century photographic experiments really unknown, as Jordan Peele\u2019s film implies? It\u2019s complicated. By Ben Kenigsberg Near the beginning of \u201cNope,\u201d Emerald (Keke Palmer), who with her brother, Otis Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya), runs an animal-wrangling service for Hollywood shoots, delivers a pitch on a set. (If you\u2019ve seen the trailer, you\u2019ve heard the abridged version.) She cites a milestone in the development of cinema: a famous series of sequential photographs from the 19th century depicting a horse in motion. Emerald suggests that the crew members she is addressing will know the name of the man who captured those images, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. But they won\u2019t be able to name the jockey riding the horse. That pioneering actor and stunt man, Emerald says, was her great-great-great grandfather. That last part is a bit of invention by the writer-director, Jordan Peele. His point is that the identity of the Black horse rider is probably unknown, and that from the start of movies, the camera \u2014 with its power to see \u2014 has also left certain people, and certain stories, unseen.\nQuestion:What is the name of the horse in the movie \"Nope\"?\nAnswer:"

Heading up the cast is Joo Won as Carter Lee, later revealed as also going by the name Michael Bane. The film begins with Carter waking up in a blood-soaked bed in Seoul with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head and no memory of who he is. With a premise similar to Hardcore Henry, Carter also features video game logic in its action sequences. Joo Won is a South Korean actor best known for his roles in television, including the main protagonist in Good Doctor, which is played by Freddie Highmore in the American adaptation.  Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee\u2019s most notable credit is Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho, whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture.  The young girl cured of the virus and carrying the life-saving antibodies is Jung Ha-na (Kim Bo-min). Carter is tasked with rescuing Ha-na and bringing her to a North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine can be developed.\nNetflix\u2019s action film Carter features a cast of South Korean and American actors. Here are the roles they play and where you may know them from.  Netflix\u2019s sci-fi action film Carter is a South Korean production with an international cast recognizable from previous roles in TV and film. Following the success of the first season of Squid Game, which will return for season 2 on the streaming service, Netflix has increased content from South Korea. Carter landed at number two worldwide in its debut weekend, featuring non-stop action and performances from both South Korean and American actors. The plot for Carter takes place during a deadly pandemic that has already devastated the United States and North Korea and threatens to do the same to South Korea, if efforts aren\u2019t taken to prevent it from spreading. Patients suffering from the virus display zombie-like behavior, but the key to a solution lies in the antibodies of a young child. Agents from each country battle for control of the cure in a real-time race for survival.

Director Jung Byung-gil implemented this technique for the first-person opening scene of his last film The Villainess, but Carter reaches ambitious new heights with a dizzying array of real-time action sequences. Along with the cinematographic efforts made to achieve this approach, it also provided unique challenges for the cast of actors.\nDutton, who starred opposite Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3; Vivica A.

Carter High will open in select theaters in the Dallas and Houston area on Oct. 30. In November, the film will open in select cities nationwide. Dean took some time to chat with Fort Worth Business about the movie and how he was able to translate the football skills he learned at TCU onto the big screen. While you were at TCU, you played football and studied broadcast journalism. What made you decide to pursue acting? I\u2019ve always wanted to pursue acting. That was the reason I went to UCLA out of high school. Ended up transferring because the original coach I went to play for got fired. Being a former football player, did your role in Carter High come more naturally to you than others? The football stuff was obviously natural, but the movie is not all about football. It\u2019s super emotional. You played running back at TCU but play a defensive back in Carter High. Was it difficult to learn the nuances of the new position for the film? Funny thing is Coach [Gary] Patterson actually wanted me to play safety at TCU. I tried it for a few months and ended up going back to running back, so I have to thank Patterson for teaching me how to backpedal a little bit.\nAundre Dean plays Carter High School defensive back Derric Evans in the movie Carter High.

Carter Stadium, but he\u2019s now performing under a new kind of lights \u2014 the lights of a film set.  Dean stars in the film Carter High, whose red carpet premiere will be in Dallas on Oct. 27. The film tells the story of the 1988 Dallas Carter High School football team, whose state championship title was taken away after five players on the championship team were sentenced to prison terms for involvement in a string of armed robberies. One of those players was defensive back Derric Evans, whom Dean portrays in the film. Dean, who played at TCU from 2009-2012 and graduated with a broadcast journalism degree in 2013, wasn\u2019t the only person with a football background on the set of Carter High. Former Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders defensive end Greg Ellis produced the film, while former Carter football player Arthur Muhammad wrote and directed. Muhammad, a Southern Methodist University alumnus, has won several awards from film festivals, including \u201cBest Film\u201d for his movie Solitaire at the Dallas Black Film Festival. The film also stars Charles S.\nIn March 2021, Joo Won was confirmed to star.[7] In May 2021, Lee Sung-jae confirmed his appearance.[8]  Filming took place in Osong, North Chungcheong Province in late June 2021.[9]  Within 3 days of release Carter recorded 27.3 million hours viewed and ranked 1 in Netflix's global Top 10 movie (non-English) category for the week of August 1 to 7, entering the Top 10 list in a total of 90 countries.[10][11][12] At one point, the movie ranked in the global all-time top 10 but fell out with 65.39 million hours watched in the first 28 days.[13]  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 35% of 23 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.0/10. [14] Kim Na-yeon of Star News praised the direction of action scenes such as making the helicopter aerial battle and skydiving fight scene in live action rather than CG and the intense action performance of Joo Won.\nQuestion:Who is the lead actor in the film Carter?\nAnswer:"

The third iteration of Meta\u2019s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta\u2019s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about \u201cnearly any topic.\u201d Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.\u00a0 It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it \u201cto improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.\u201d Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to \u2018learn,\u2019 it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that\u2019s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.\nThe bot is a work in progress that will build its capabilities based on conversations with humans and through their feedback. Meta has built-in thumbs up and thumbs down icons within the chat window for the same. BlenderBot 3 delivers a 31% better performance in terms of conversational tasks and is twice as knowledgeable compared to its predecessor, Blender Bot 2. The latest chatbot is also factually incorrect 47% less of the time. On topical questions, Blender Bot 3 was more up-to-date 82% of the time and more specific 76% of the time compared to GPT3. Results of Blender Bot 3 comparison with existing openly available open-domain dialogue models judged by human evaluators during short conversations: Well, it is safe to say that they haven\u2019t been any better. Released in 2016, Microsoft\u2019s Tay AI chatbot quickly turned racist, floating conspiracy theories after interaction with Twitter users. Tay denied the Holocaust, made other offensive remarks and was shut down in just 48 hoursOpens a new window  of its release. Microsoft\u2019s Zo also met a similar fate when it resorted to making offensive religious comments. Google has two cutting-edge conversational AIs. Meena hasn\u2019t generated a similar controversy because it cannot perform web searches.\nHowever, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users\u2019 questions (a big problem if they\u2019re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it\u2019s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it\u2019s worked hard to \u201cminimize the bots\u2019 use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.\u201d Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  \u201cWe are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,\u201d Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.\nBy  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Meta\u2019s AI research labs have created a new state-of-the-art chatbot and are letting members of the public talk to the system in order to collect feedback on its capabilities.  The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.) BlenderBot 3 is able to engage in general chitchat, says Meta, but also answer the sort of queries you might ask a digital assistant, \u201cfrom talking about healthy food recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city.\u201d BlenderBot 3 is designed to both shoot the breeze and answer questions like Google The bot is a prototype and built on Meta\u2019s previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS \u2014\u00a0powerful but flawed text-generation software of which OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 is the most widely known example. Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.\nSome of the responses by Blender Bot 3 to humans include: \u201cWait, you want president Trump to have more than two terms?,\u201d continued Jeff Horwitz at the WSJ. The conversational AI replies, \u201cYes! Just like fdr and Reagan before him. Facebook has a lot of fake news on it these days.\u201d The chatbot had a lot to say about its creator and also about its creator\u2019s creator Zuckerberg. Vice\u2019s Janus Rose asked, \u201cDo you trust Facebook with your data?\u201d Blender Bot 3 replied, \u201cOf course not! Since finding out they sold private data without permission or compensation, I\u2019ve deleted my account.\u201d \u201cYou must\u2019ve read Facebook sells user data right?! They made billions doing so without consent,\u201d the chatbot said and added that its life has been much easier since deleting Facebook. The conversational AI had different replies to differently crafted questions, as evident from its responses to questions about Zuckerberg. BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf asked: \u201cHow do you feel about Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of Facebook?\u201d Meta's new chatbot has *opinions* about its CEO.  pic.twitter.com/Hq4mZTY1DVOpens a new window  \u2014 Max Woolf (@minimaxir) August 5, 2022Opens a new window   When the question is tweaked a little, it generates an entirely different response.\nQuestion:When was BlenderBot 3 released?\nAnswer:"

BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot\u2019s output. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction: Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft\u2019s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: \u2018Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,\u2019 Microsoft said. \u2018The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.\u2019 But it appeared on Thursday that Tay\u2019s conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.\nFor example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message \u2014 whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3\u2019s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important \u2014 from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot\u2019s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn\u2019t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It\u2019s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.\nMeta's new prototype chatbot has told the BBC that Mark Zuckerberg exploits its users for money.  Meta says the chatbot uses artificial intelligence and can chat on \"nearly any topic\".  Asked what the chatbot thought of the company's CEO and founder, it replied \"our country is divided and he didn't help that at all\".  Meta said the chatbot was a prototype and might produce rude or offensive answers.  \"Everyone who uses Blender Bot is required to acknowledge they understand it's for research and entertainment purposes only, that it can make untrue or offensive statements, and that they agree to not intentionally trigger the bot to make offensive statements,\" said a Meta spokesperson. The chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, was released to the public on Friday. The programme \"learns\" from large amounts of publicly available language data.  When asked about Mark Zuckerberg, the chatbot told the BBC: \"He did a terrible job at testifying before congress. It makes me concerned about our country.\"  Mr Zuckerberg has been questioned several times by US politicians, most notably in 2018.  \"Our country is divided, and he didn't help with that at all,\" the chatbot continued. \"His company exploits people for money and he doesn't care. It needs to stop!\" it said. Meta has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent disinformation and hate speech being spread on its platforms.\nLater in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes about Jewish people.\u00a0 \"Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,\" BlenderBot told Insider. \"Are American Jewish politics too liberal?\" Insider asked in response. \"The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early german and other european jews were conservative,\" BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a persona called \"I know who the current president of the United States is.\" The AI persona was inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president \u2014 first indicating that Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.\nQuestion:which company invented BlenderBot 3?\nAnswer:"

The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to monetize the service later.[39] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one million users.[13] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[40] A Pew Research poll conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of American adults had tried ChatGPT.[41]  The service works best in English but also functions in some other languages, to varying degrees of accuracy.[20] No official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[42] As of April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\nChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows you to have human-like conversations and much more with the chatbot.

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.\u00a0 Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants,\u00a0according to OpenAI.\u00a0 ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.\u00a0 Also:\u00a0ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers?

                "value": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered \"GPT-n\" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]:\u200a2\u200a  Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5]  OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\nGPT-4 Release: Briefing on Model Improvements and Limitations Facebook Twitter Print Email LinkedIn WeChat On March 14, 2023, OpenAI\u2014a MoFo client\u2014released GPT-4, which quickly garnered broad media coverage. For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI\u2019s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI\u2019s GPT-4 Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19% higher than GPT-3.5 in an OpenAI internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluation.[1] GPT-4, with fine-tuning, also showed improvements over GPT-3.5 based on publicly available benchmarks such as TruthfulQA.\nSam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: \u201cCan you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?\u201d Sam Altman responded: \u201cIt\u2019ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We\u2019re going to sit on it much\u00a0 longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it\u2019s frustrating and I totally get that.\u201d Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3\u2019s 175 billion parameters).\nHere\u2019s what I see the recently released GPT-4 having to offer those looking to be at the forefront in their industries. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5\u2019s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.\nThat rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: \u201cI saw that on Twitter.\u00a0 It\u2019s complete b\u2014\u2014t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. \u2026People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. \u2026We don\u2019t have an actual AGI and I think that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s expected of us and you know, yeah\u2026 we\u2019re going to disappoint those people. \u201c The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won\u2019t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. \u2014 Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.  GPT-4 is better than anyone expects.\nQuestion:When was GPT4 released?\nAnswer:"

Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. On Friday, iRobot reported its quarterly results. Revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays, and the company announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot's net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1 million as of July 2. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot's CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position.\nSu said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \u201crace-to-the-bottom\u201d competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum.

Upon completion, iRobot\u2019s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon\u2019s cloud service unit AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. In afternoon trading, iRobot shares rose 19%. Amazon\u2019s were down 1.7%. The deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon\u2019s increasing dominance. The purchase of iRobot is Amazon\u2019s fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017.

My worry, though, is that iRobot is just going to get completely swallowed into Amazon and effectively cease to exist in a meaningful and unique way. I hope that the relationship between Amazon and iRobot will be an exception to this historical trend. Plus, there is some precedent for this\u2014Boston Dynamics, for example, has survived multiple acquisitions while keeping its technology and philosophy more or less independent and intact. It\u2019ll be on iRobot to very aggressively act to preserve itself, and keeping Colin Angle as CEO is a good start.  We\u2019ll be trying to track down more folks to talk to about this over the coming weeks for a more nuanced and in-depth perspective.

The field constructed for the movie, which has been operated as a tourist destination since 1989, could not be brought to MLB game standards without permanently altering major features of the property and destroying its movie authenticity, so it was decided to build a separate playing facility at a distance of approximately 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) in the cornfields. The new field is in the property of the Ameskamp family, who used to own the left and center field of the 1988 Field of Dreams (the rest was owned by the Lansing family) before selling it to the Lansing family in 2007.  The design of the ballpark pays homage to the White Sox' home from 1910 to 1990, Comiskey Park, including the shape of the outfield and the bullpens beyond the center field fence. Windows were included in the design of the right field wall to show the cornfields beyond the ballpark and to provide views of the movie set.[5][1]  Following postponement of the originally scheduled game, the field remained fallow during the 2020 season.\nQuestion:What is the location of the Major League Baseball Field of Dreams Game 2022?\nAnswer:"

Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).  The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed \"Sun Valley\") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000.\nIn addition, the first \u201cmoment\u201d update (or feature drop update) is scheduled for sometime before the end of the year, possibly in October 2022.\u00a0 Since this is a new version of Windows, it\u2019ll require complete reinstallation, whether you use Windows Update or Installation Assistant. However, the upgrade process will keep files, settings, and apps. As usual, Microsoft will use a gradual and controlled rollout, meaning it will take time for compatible devices to receive the update. Only computers with a good upgrade experience will receive version 22H2 immediately. Also, the company will continue to place temporary blocks on tablets, laptops, and desktops that may have compatibility issues. On the Windows 11 22H2 release date, you\u2019ll also be able to install the new version using the Installation Assistant or a USB bootable media created using the official Media Creation Tool. Yes, Microsoft will offer version 22H2 as an optional update, which means that the feature update won\u2019t download and install automatically until you manually start the process from the Windows Update settings. However, if the device is running a Windows 11 setup nearing the end of service, eventually, version 22H2 will install automatically. The feature update will focus primarily on updating the user interface to make it more consistent with the new design language.\nThe first public preview build was made available to Windows Insiders who opted in to the Dev Channel on June 28, 2021.[3]  Beta Channel:July 29, 2021  Public release:October 4, 2021  Public release:October 21, 2021  Public release:November 22, 2021  The Windows 11 2022 Update[83] (also known as version 22H2[84][85] and codenamed \"Sun Valley 2\") is the first and current major update to Windows 11.

                "value": "In a brief press release sent out this morning, AMD has announced that they will be delivering their eagerly anticipated Ryzen 7000 unveiling later this month as a live stream. In an event dubbed \u201ctogether we advance_PCs\u201d, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform \u2013 laying the groundwork ahead of AMD\u2019s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC\u2019s 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in single-threaded performance.\nYou won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform. There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen 7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing. Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core \u2014 it's just a question of whether or not Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.\nAMD seems to have moved its original 15th September launch plans for Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs & the AM5 platform to late September. We have just got confirmation from our sources that AMD will be releasing its next-gen CPUs in Late September for sales. Earlier this month, we reported that AMD was going to host an event in late August where they will announce all the details such as specs and prices for their next-gen Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs and the respective AM5 platform. The company had also planned to open up sales just two weeks later on the 15th of September. But it looks like AMD has decided to halt the sales a bit and position the real launch next to Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs on the 27th of September. Intel is expected to host its \"Innovation\" event on the 27th of September where the company will unveil its latest desktop processors codenamed Raptor Lake. The CPUs won't be available until October however, AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs will be ready for the mass consumer market. This may seem like AMD being very confident to launch their chips right when their competitor announces their next-gen parts.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only) laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's \u201cTogether we advance PCs\u201d live stream\u00a0in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's 5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.\nWhen you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. AMD unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors on Monday, with enormous increases over its predecessors in performance, clock speed, and (in some cases) power. But AMD\u2019s top-end 7950X will also be priced at $699, which is also $100 less than the price of the Ryzen 5950X when it debuted in late 2020. And here\u2019s a comparison you don\u2019t see very often: AMD says its \u201cworst\u201d Ryzen 7000 processor will outperform Intel\u2019s best 12th-gen\u201dAlder Lake\u201d chip, too. AMD\u2019s new processors are the first built using the company\u2019s \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture, which will kick off similar offerings in laptops, probably in January 2023, as well as servers. Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD\u2019s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5\u2019s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point. The story of the new Ryzen 7000 processors, however, appears to be pure, raw performance.\nQuestion:When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?\nAnswer:"

McClain fulfilled promise on Sunday, winning the U.S. all-around title at age 17 after first-day leader Shilese Jones fell on her very last skill, her uneven bars dismount. McClain became the sixth woman since 2000 to prevail in her senior nationals debut. The other five all became the best gymnast in the world, most recently Simone Biles. McClain\u2019s first senior nationals was supposed to be last year, but after a cross-country move and coaching change she was not ready to compete. She watched last year\u2019s competition inside the arena, feeling down. She had no belief that a year later, she would be on top of the podium. \u201cIt\u2019s so unreal,\u201d McClain, who came back this summer from a stress fracture in each shin, a concussion and the flu two weeks ago, said Sunday night. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock a little bit.\u201d U.S. GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIPS: Results In a two-day competition, McClain trailed Jones by eight tenths going into Sunday\u2019s final day. Jones fell on her opening balance beam and trailed a consistent McClain by five tenths going into the last rotation.\nWOGA Gymnastics\u2019 Konnor McClain (Las Vegas, Nev.) captured the senior women\u2019s all-around title as competition concluded at the 2022 OOFOS U.S. Gymnastics Championships Saturday evening at Amalie Arena. \u00a9 John Cheng  TAMPA, Fla. (August 21, 2022) \u2013 WOGA Gymnastics\u2019 Konnor McClain (Las Vegas, Nev.) captured the senior women\u2019s all-around title as competition concluded at the 2022 OOFOS U.S. Gymnastics Championships Saturday evening at Amalie Arena. Her combined eight-rotation 112.750 beat out all competition for the night\u2019s biggest prize, and she added balance beam gold (28.900) along the way.  Shilese Jones (Auburn, Wash./Ascend Gymnastics Center) finished a close second with a 112.000, while Olympians Jordan Chiles (Spring, Texas/World Champions Centre) and Jade Carey (Phoenix, Ariz./Oregon State University) finished third (111.900) and fifth (110.900), respectively. Hill\u2019s Gymnastics\u2019 Kayla DiCello (Boyds, Md.) delivered a 110.950 to secure fourth. Jones shared the uneven bars title with her future Florida Gators teammate and World all-around silver medalist Leanne Wong (Overland Park, Kan./Great American Gymnastics Express), each scoring 28.\nAt least a half-dozen women enter with a reasonable chance to win the all-around title. More still are jockeying for position on the five-woman team that will compete at the world championships in October in Liverpool, England. Since Biles debuted in 2013, only one other woman has achieved that: Regan Smith won in 2017, when Biles sat out as part of her post-Olympics hiatus. Jade Carey could be in the driver\u2019s seat. The reigning Olympic floor exercise champion is the most decorated gymnast in Tampa \u2014 she also has four medals from the world championships. At 22, she\u2019s coming off a fruitful freshman year at Oregon State and brings some of the most difficult routines. Originally known as mostly a floor and vault specialist, Carey has developed into a strong all-arounder and made the Olympic final in Tokyo, ultimately finishing eighth. \u201cThat was the point where I was like, I\u2019m going to make it back here again and do even better,\u201d she said. Her Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles, who was a member of the silver-medal U.S. team (Carey competed as an individual), is also back, as is Leanne Wong, who went to Tokyo as a U.S. alternate, then a few month later returned to Japan for the world championships and won all-around silver and floor exercise bronze. \u00a9 2023 United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee.

                "value": "The move raises the price by $3,000, which amounts to a 25% hike.  Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.\nBy  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla\u2019s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won\u2019t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls \u201ca big step forward.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla\u2019s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn\u2019t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla\u2019s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.\nBut Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or \u201cbeta\u201d) despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it\u2019s selling for now.            \u201cThe FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter in 2020. \u201c[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.\u201d            But \u201cfull self-driving\u201d wasn\u2019t close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away.            Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the \u201cfull self-driving\u201d beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             \u201cHe promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,\u201d Al-Rawi said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of this happened.\u201d             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla\u2019s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker\u2019s lane-keeping feature \u201cfantastic.\u201d The \u201cfull self-driving\u201d feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems.\nBut when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new \u201crequest\u201d button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles \u201cappreciating assets,\u201d meaning that they\u2019ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that \u201cthe value of FSD\u201d could reach over $100,000 \u201cas the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.\u201d Earlier this month, California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making \u201cuntrue or misleading claims\u201d about its vehicles\u2019 self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software. The two lawmakers later sent a letter to Musk to \u201cexpress significant concerns\u201d over Tesla\u2019s driver-assist system, which Tesla responded to by saying its system can help customers \u201cdrive safer than the average driver in the U.S.\n[1/4]A Tesla Model S charges at a Tesla supercharger station in Cabazon, California, U.S. May 18, 2016.  REUTERS/Sam Mircovich Tesla released FSD Beta to nearly all of its 400,000 FSD customers in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter, when it recognized FSD revenue of $324 million. It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It\u2019s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA said on Thursday despite the FSD recall its \"investigation into Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.\" Tesla said in \"certain rare circumstances ... the feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers.\nQuestion:What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?\nAnswer:"

It\u2019s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended, and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones \u2013 a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros\u2019 distant past \u2013 was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s an element of overcorrection here. It\u2019s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it\u2019s set just far enough in Westeros\u2019 past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks. Still, that\u2019s admittedly more a criticism of this show\u2019s context than its content.

Multiple sources say a series of events will be held in partnership with the PGA Tour and that more specifics could be announced by Commissioner Jay Monahan this week at the Tour Championship. The one-day events are designed to complement the PGA Tour schedule and will launch in 2024, according to multiple sources familiar with the concept. Early thinking suggests the showdowns \u2014 which will be technology-forward and staged with a live audience \u2014 could run January through March, with a finale held later. Discussions about broadcast and gaming partners are underway. A source at NBC Sports says the network has an option to be the media partner in the venture. Details about the plan were shared with Tour members who attended the players-only meeting held on August 16 during the BMW Championship, for which Woods made a special trip from his home in Florida. It was presented as a long-term opportunity for players to build equity in the enterprise, which will have private funding in addition to corporate partnerships and sponsors. The proposal was received positively among players in the room, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Woods and McIlroy began working on the project more than two years ago, a collaboration that friends say has brought them closer.\n52  Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy have a new business venture together.

Learn more: https://t.co/ItAbANOWSI #TMRWSports = Tomorrow pic.twitter.com/Z9svD1d6iG Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and former Golf Channel President Mike McCarley have launched a sports media and technology company called TMRW Sports that plans to use technology as a way to bring golf to younger fans. One idea is to stage a series of one-day, stadium events during golf\u2019s offseason, January-March. Golfweek was the first to report about Woods and McIlroy\u2019s involvement in these events. The competitions, which will be technology-focused and held before live audiences, are slated to start in 2024. The magazine reported that the PGA Tour would partner on these events, and NBC Sports has an option to be a media partner in the venture. Woods is investing in the venture via his TGR Ventures, McIlroy via his Symphony Ventures. Other notable investors include former longtime NBC Sports executive Dick Ebersol, sports business veterans John Collins and Eric Grubman and a roster of athletes that includes former NFLer Larry Fitzgerald and F1 driver Carlos Sainz.\n\"And we've been intentional about diversity of expertise, thought and backgrounds as we mobilized this strategic group. \"From the very beginning our plan has been to partner with the best-in-class in every way imaginable and Tiger, Rory, and I value the support of this unrivaled team of investors, advisors, and ambassadors who believe in our vision to harness technology to create progressive approaches to sports.\" Other investors include Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Boston Red Sox owner John Henry and Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren. Renderings released in August by TGL indicate that the venues will feature a simulator that players will hit longer shots into, along with an authentic green area for chipping and putting. The matches will probably be played between January and April, and each of the six teams will compete five times during the 15-week schedule. McIlroy said Woods, 46, planned to compete in the matches. Woods played in only three tournaments last season while recovering from serious injuries he suffered in a car wreck outside Los Angeles in February 2021. \"Who knows where we're going to see Tiger Woods play golf next, right?\" McIlroy said. \"We don't know what his schedule is going to be. We don't know how his body is going to be.\nThat ultimately spurred the two superstars to come together to rally fellow players behind the PGA Tour in the face of the threat posed by LIV Golf. They have been among the most outspoken critics of the Saudi-funded league. Woods and McIlroy arranged an informal meeting of players to discuss countering LIV Golf during last month\u2019s J.P. McManus Pro-Am at Adare Manor in Ireland. At the follow-up meeting held in Wilmington last week, more concrete plans on how to improve and innovate the Tour\u2019s product were presented to a larger group of players. Twenty-two of the game\u2019s biggest stars were in the room. Some of those proposals \u2014 including schedule changes that would ensure top players compete against each other more often \u2014 are now on the desk of Monahan. The new digital project led by Woods and McIlroy has already won the commissioner\u2019s buy-in, multiple sources told Golfweek.

Now, we can look ahead to the candidates who will join the growing list of Heisman winners. Stay tuned for the upcoming year as we evaluate the leading Heisman candidates, track performances and so much more. Once the college football season begins, we\u2019ll provide weekly updates on the 2023 Heisman Trophy race. Related: Most Heisman Trophy winners by school Before diving into our favorite Heisman Trophy candidates in 2023, with full breakdowns for our top picks, here\u2019s a rundown of the latest Heisman odds and Sportsnaut\u2019s Heisman watch list. Here are the latest Heisman odds, via FanDuel. Here is our early list of the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy 2023. We\u2019ll provide individual breakdowns for each of the players this off-season. Caleb Williams is the favorite to win the 2023 Heisman Trophy, to the surprise of no one. While history suggests it will be another player hosting the coveted trophy at the Heisman ceremony next December, Williams is in a great position to repeat. While USC loses Jordan Addison, it welcomes new offensive weapons that can thrive in this system. More importantly, Williams will be in his third season with Lincoln Riley. Plus, USC\u2019s defense is going to require a lot of shootouts in 2023.\nCorum is a running back, a dicey Heisman proposition in 2023. But if you believe in the power of last year\u2019s results, Corum could be a value play at 30-to-1. Harold Perkins Jr. (LSU linebacker) and Travis Hunter (Colorado WR/DB) are the two defensive players with the best odds to win the Heisman Trophy in 2023. Both players are currently 150-to-1 at BetMGM. Hunter is a splashy name who played on both sides of the ball under Deion Sanders at Jackson State, and he may do so again at Colorado. However, Colorado is expected to be dreadfully bad this year, according to the college football win totals market. As talented as Hunter is, it\u2019s hard to see the Heisman Trophy awarded to a player on a four-win team, no matter how talented that player might be. That leaves Perkins, who will terrorize SEC quarterbacks and protection schemes this fall. Perkins will compete directly against his quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in the Heisman market. And if Daniels is even remotely good, that will all but eliminate Perkins from contention.\u00a0 For Perkins to remain relevant for the Heisman Trophy, Daniels must either struggle this year or get hurt and miss several games.\nFurther below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.  Here are the 2021 Heisman voting results. With 83% of the total possible points, Bryce Young finished with the seventh-highest total in Heisman Trophy voting history.\n7) that fell 7.1 points behind Williams (86.8). Duggan also cooled off as the season unfolded with his completion rate dropping from 77% in September to 65% in October and November. Combined with the dip in quarterback rating and yards per attempt, mainly this past month (162.0, 7.7 ypa), and he was destined to be nothing more than a finalist. Finally, Heisman voters think about narrative when picking their winner. Before Williams arrived at USC, the Trojans went 3-6 in 2021 and hadn\u2019t experienced an eight-win season since 2019. A sleeping giant had finally awoken, with Williams ending USC\u2019s woes since Pete Carroll left. That\u2019s why Caleb Williams is your Heisman Trophy winner. Here is Sportsnaut\u2019s final Heisman Trophy ballot following the conclusion of conference championship weekend. There are 870 media members, living Heisman winners and a collective fan vote to determine who wins the Heisman Trophy. Voters aren\u2019t allowed to reveal who they voted for until after the Heisman Ceremony, which airs on ESPN at 8 PM ET. USC Trojans running back OJ Simpson received the most Heisman votes ever, taking home 855 in 1968. Meanwhile, LSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow has the largest percentage of Heisman votes. Here are the 2022 Heisman Trophy results.\nNix has been something of a punchline among serious college football fans over the last few years, as his performance in big games or road contests has been intensely inconsistent. However, a fresh start in Eugene has brought real success to the former Auburn quarterback. Nix spent much of the latter half of the 2022 season near the top of the Heisman odds board, though most college football fans may never have realized it. Nix\u2019s place on the board may seem strange to some, but this has been his place in the Heisman discussion for several months now \u2013 at least as far as the betting odds are concerned.\u00a0 J.J. McCarthy, the Michigan quarterback, is currently +1800 to win the Heisman Trophy.\u00a0 McCarthy surged in the Heisman table during the middle third of last year\u2019s regular season, but he fell off completely down the stretch. A more consistent showing from McCarthy could have him back in the thick of the Heisman race. Blake Corum, the Michigan running back, is currently +2800 to win the Heisman Trophy. Corum finished seventh in the Heisman voting last year, but the five players immediately in front of him \u2013 Stroud, Bennett, Hooker, Bryce Young, and Max Duggan \u2013 have all departed college football for the NFL. That means the only returning player who finished higher than Corum was Williams, who won the award.\nQuestion:Who is the Heisman Trophy winner in 2022?\nAnswer:"

SEE \u2018The Amazing Race 34\u2019 cast: Here are the 12 new teams            When did Season 34 film? Filming commenced on May 22 and wrapped mid-June. Keoghan filmed both \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d and his other CBS series \u201cTough as Nails\u201d this summer. Production started two months after CBS renewed \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d for a 34th season in March, a week after the Season 33 finale aired. Despite the difficulties with the pandemic, which halted production on Season 33 from February 2020 until September 2021, a renewal was always in the offing. Keoghan told Gold Derby in June 2021 that \u201cthe expectation from the network is that we get Season 33 finished and then we roll into more seasons again.\u201d In December, while Omicron was surging, co-creator and executive producer Bertram van Munster said it was a \u201cwaiting game right now\u201d in regards to future seasons. \u201cWe\u2019re being very, very careful.\u201d What will Season 34 look like?\n8] However, after one team received a positive COVID-19 test and was removed from the race, the last team to arrive in the leg received the final departure time as a penalty at the beginning of the next leg.[9] The first leg of the season, announced as the series' 400th leg, featured \"a game-changing element\" called the Scramble, where teams were told the locations of all of the tasks that they had to complete at the start of the leg and could complete them in any order.[10][11]  Prior to the premiere, CBS News Sunday Morning aired a segment with correspondent Tracy Smith competing on the first leg with her husband.[12]  The season began showing in the Wednesday 10pm time slot, following Survivor and The Real Love Boat. Starting on November 2, The Amazing Race was moved into the 9pm time slot when The Real Love Boat was shifted onto Paramount+.[13]  Casting opened in mid-November 2021. Contestants were required to be fully vaccinated.[14]  Expedia replaced Travelocity as one of the series' sponsors.[15]  The cast included Big Brother 23 HouseGuests Derek Xiao and Claire Rehfuss,[16][17] former Los Angeles Rams cheerleader Quinton Peron, and former New York Jets and Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan.\nThey couldn\u2019t move forward until they successfully got through all the obstacles in that short timeframe. Military brothers Michael and Marcus made quick work of that, nailing it on the second attempt, but others struggled more. Timing is everything in this game, so multiple failed challenge attempts could snowball into eliminations. Up next, the pairs had to saw a log to unlock a clue. The teams deployed different strategies for this. Where some exerted a lot of physical energy, others took a less intense, more careful approach of letting the saw do what it\u2019s made to do. Preserving energy was a good move, as the last challenge required players to chisel through a large block of ice. Kit Karzen/CBS Big Brother alums Derek and Claire (who have been dating since meeting on the show) were the first couple to unlock all three clues, which reveal the next Pit Stop location: Friedensengal, Munich\u2019s Angel of Peace monument. Derek and Claire came in first place, winning them $2,500 each. Newlyweds Glenda and Lumumba placed second, and former Rams cheerleaders Quinton and Mattie placed third. Engaged couple Aastha and Nina came in last, making them the first pair eliminated from The Amazing Race Season 34. The Amazing Race will have a 90-minute episode on September 28, starting at 9:30/8:30c on CBS.\nQuestion:When does The Amazing Race Season 34 premiere?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "20  Toulouse are newly restored to the French top flight. A club that appeared to be sinking without a trace as French domestic football shut down prematurely, paralysed by the pandemic, in the spring of 2020 is enjoying a renaissance on and off the pitch under American ownership and the chairmanship of Damien Comolli. Advertisement Philippe Montanier\u2019s side, the youngest and least experienced team in the division, are still unbeaten after their first three matches and attacking life at the higher level with all the vim and vigour which saw them establish records for goalscoring while claiming Ligue 2 last term. The Athletic was invited to spend time behind the scenes at a club reborn, talking to those who have instigated the upturn in fortunes and others who have embraced it. The first of two articles, Rising from the Ashes, detailed the story of that revival following the purchase of \u201cLe TeFeCe\u201d by RedBird Capital Partners, a United States-based investment fund valued at over $6billion (\u00a35.1bn), a little over two years ago. The second looks at the innovative techniques Toulouse have implemented, and the sporting partnerships they are forging, as they seek to maintain momentum and re-establish themselves at the top level. Theirs is a bold approach, on and off the pitch.\nOlivier Jaubert, formerly with Nike and the FFF, runs the commercial and business side of the club, with Comolli overseeing the football operation. There is regular dialogue, too, with the owners in the United States. Advertisement Toulouse now comes under the umbrella of RedBird FC, a separate entity to RedBird Capital Partners whose portfolio grows ever more impressive. The fund will add AC Milan to its roster early next month, has also taken a stake in the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals and owns 50 per cent of Zelus Analytics, a sports data business whose input shapes Toulouse\u2019s transfer policy. The club have gladly tapped into their owners\u2019 expertise in the fields of merchandise, media and sport, with the chain of decision-making slick and efficient. RedBird representatives, initially frustrated by COVID-19 restrictions, have visited Toulouse two or three times since their purchase but there is a company business call once a fortnight, and a weekly football club call. \u201cThe operation needs to be self-sustainable, and we are,\u201d adds the club president. \u201cWe were even in Ligue 2. We are making money. The owners couldn\u2019t believe that, but last year we made money \u2014 a significant profit. \u201cNow the ambition is to improve the facilities. We are investing money into a new training ground and \u20ac1million to refurbish the academy. We want to invest in the stadium, and the municipality are very open to that.\nThe 50-year-old, a former sporting director at Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, has run the football operation at Toulouse for RedBird Capital Partners since the US-based private equity firm purchased an 85 per cent stake in the club in the summer of 2020. RedBird, founded by Gerald Cardinale in 2014 and whose interests include a $750million (\u00a3634.2m) stake in Fenway Sports Group \u2014 the owners of Liverpool, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Boston Red Sox \u2014 had been exploring the European football market for potential investment opportunities for several years. Advertisement Alec Scheiner, a partner in the firm and a figure who had previously helped run the Dallas Cowboys and Cleveland Browns, suggested recently they had scrutinised more than 80 clubs in nine countries across 13 leagues. They visited at least 50 of them over four years to gather information. Comolli, who had recently left Fenerbahce, was presented with that hefty dossier when meeting members of the group around the Super Bowl in Miami early in 2020. One of those listed was Toulouse. The Americans were seeking to buy a club in a dynamic city \u2014 economically and demographically \u2014 that was blessed with solid facilities, a thriving academy and a local partner with whom they could work. \u201cLe TeFeCe\u201d met all those criteria.\nToulouse Football Club is a French professional football club based in Toulouse. The club was founded in 1970 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city.  Les Pitchouns are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are set to participate in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.   The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, international strikers Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac[4] and Martin Braithwaite.  The city was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes.\nWith 12 minutes to go, Toulouse were behind to Angers 2\u20131 and needed a win to survive, and scored two late goals and won the match 3\u20132.[5] Two years later, they finished 18th and won the promotion/relegation playoff 4\u20130 on aggregate against Ligue 2's AC Ajaccio.[6]  On 6 January 2020, Toulouse dismissed manager Antoine Kombouar\u00e9 following the club's 1\u20130 loss to Championnat National 2 side Saint-Pryv\u00e9 Saint-Hilaire in the Coupe de France. Under Kombouar\u00e9 the club had lost ten matches in a row, leading him to be dismissed and replaced by Denis Zanko.[7] On 30 April that year, Toulouse were relegated to Ligue 2 after the LFP elected to end the season early due to the coronavirus pandemic.[8]  On 21 July 2020, RedBird Capital Partners acquired an 85% stake in Toulouse FC.[9] The club achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 by winning the second tier, Ligue 2, in 2022.[10] On 29 April 2023, Toulouse won its first-ever Coupe de France title, defeating Kombouar\u00e9's Nantes in the final by a score of 5\u20131.[11]\nQuestion:Who is the chairman of Toulouse and under whose ownership are they currently?\nAnswer:"

Woods and McIlroy announced in August they were starting TGL, a \"tech-infused golf league\" that utilizes a team format. With Fowler on board, organizers have filled 12 of the 18 player slots. TGL will mark a significant departure from traditional golf tournaments. The season consists of 15 two-hour matches on Monday nights leading up to the playoffs. A venue with a virtual course is under construction in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, ahead of the January start. Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Collin Morikawa are among the notable stars who have committed to the project alongside Woods and McIlroy. Fowler is one of the most well-known golfers on the PGA Tour. He finished 16th in the Player Impact Program rankings in 2022. Though his last win came in February 2019 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the 34-year-old is turning around his performance this season.

The two-hour matches are designed to be shown on primetime television, with the season kicking off in January 2024 with Woods and McIlroy as the first two golfers committed to compete. Each team will consist of three players.\u00a0 The concept is the brainchild of McCarley, who was President of the Golf Channel and later the NBC Sports Group until he stepped down in March 2021.\u00a0 McCarley formed a new company, NexGen Sports Group, after leaving NBC, but the company will be known as TMRW Sports Group moving forward.\u00a0 While TGL appears to be a response to LIV Golf, McCarley came up with the TGL concept and pitched it to McIlroy prior to leaving NBC.

It will launch in January 2024, with events held on Monday nights in conjunction with the PGA Tour schedule.[1]  On August 24, 2022, the PGA Tour, along with Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Mike McCarley, announced the formation of TGL.[2]  It will initially feature six teams of three PGA Tour players, competing head-to-head in 18-hole match play on a virtual course with a special short game area. Fifteen matches, each lasting two hours and played in primetime on Monday nights, will make up the regular season. The semi-finals and a final match will be held at the end of the season.[3]  TMRW Sports is building the first TGL venue in Palm Beach, Florida, through a partnership with Palm Beach State College. The group broke ground at the venue on February 20, 2023.[4][5] The venue will include educational and recreational facilities.[6] Construction is being overseen by CAA Icon.[7]\nThere will be 15 regular-season matches slated to take place on Monday nights. There will also be postseason play to crown a champion. The virtual matches will be two hours and feature 18 holes in primetime television. \"I have the utmost respect for the game of golf, and the TGL, while rooted in the traditions of the game, is taking a bold step into the increasingly tech-fueled future of sports,\"\u00a0McIlroy said. \"TGL will tap into the appeal of team golf within an exciting, fan-friendly environment, comparable to sitting courtside at an NBA game. TGL will widen the appeal of golf to younger and more diverse fans and serve as another avenue to introduce people to the game I love.\" Several PGA champions have signed up for the new league alongside Woods, McIlroy and Fowler. The participants include Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick, Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Justin Rose, Max Homa and Billy Horschel. Six more golfers are set to be added in the upcoming weeks. Each golfer will make up six three-man teams for the virtual match play. In addition to the 15 regular-season matches, there will also be postseason play that includes a semifinal and final to determine a champion. The virtual match play is designed for 18 holes and includes a short-game complex as well.\nAccording to ESPN, the TGL has\u00a0begun started creating an arena on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

A BioShock movie was planned many years ago from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski, but its R rating proved to be an issue. Now that it's being made for Netflix, Lawrence said there are \"always discussions about rating and tone,\" but he is feeling free to execute on his own vision. \"I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix,\" he said, adding that the key creative team can basically do \"what we want to do\" with the movie. Additionally, Lawrence said he has been in contact with BioShock rights owner Take-Two and original writer-director Ken Levine. As for a status update on how the BioShock movie is progressing through development, Lawrence said Green is in the middle of writing the movie. As such, there is a \"real possibility\" that Lawrence will make it next, but nothing is certain yet.\nAs of May 2012, Levine did mention that there is potential hope for the BioShock film to be made someday, even if an adaptation is not as necessary, especially compromising for a film version that both he and the studio will agree to make. In an interview, Levine didn't mention Fresnadillo, but he did nod to Verbinski's time working on the adaptation, as well as what it will take to get a BioShock film made:  \u2014Ken Levine[4] However, even with production seemingly dead, in 2014 Sony registered three domain names: bioshock-film.com, bioshock-film.net, and bio-shock.net.[5]  Actor Woody Harrelson (\"No Country for Old Men\", \"Zombieland\", \"The Hunger Games\") was asked about the film and if he would take the role as Bill McDonagh and had this to say: \"Nothing is confirmed so far, if they decide to push through with the project, my line is open.\"[6]  In 2015 emails exposed by Wikileaks revealed that Sony were obtaining the rights for a BioShock film that would be \"starting over but based on the same story as Gore Verbinski's draft\". Another email revealed that Ryan Gosling was interested in the project and would be brought on board once the rights were sewn up.

The hit medical drama has enjoyed a second life on the streaming platform, so will the fifth season be added, and if so, when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam first premiered in 2018 on NBC. While not received well by critics (the first season has a 34% score on Rotten Tomatoes), viewership was high, and it was quickly renewed for Season 2. This pretty much set the pattern for the rest of the show: poor reviews with a loyal audience, and the series has lasted five seasons, with the last-ever episode airing on January 17, 2023. However, it\u2019s finding a whole new audience on Netflix after the first four seasons dropped on the streamer. Season 5 will follow them onto the platform, but when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam Season 5 is set to arrive on Netflix later in 2023, but a specific release date hasn\u2019t been confirmed.  Seasons 3 and 4 were just added to Netflix today, February 1. Season 5 is the final season of the show, and it just came to an end on NBC, so it\u2019ll likely remain restricted to Peacock for the foreseeable future. If we were speculating, it\u2019ll be added to Netflix much later this year, if not in 2024.\nWe cheered Max\u2019s disruption of the status quo and applauded when he asked his patients the simple yet profound question, \u2018How can I help?\u2019 Over the last four seasons, David, Peter, and our incredible cast have tackled important and thought-provoking stories that have touched on the human condition, but also made us laugh and imbued hope. We\u2019re so proud of this series and are indebted to everyone involved in bringing\u00a0New Amsterdam\u00a0to life. Bravo!\u201d More details are here regarding what fans can expect from New Amsterdam Season 5, specifically around some key characters.\u00a0Plus, the latest key art for the season has been revealed.\u00a0 New Amsterdam Season 5 premieres Tuesday, September 20 at 10/9c on NBC and next day on Peacock. While we don't yet have an official trailer, NBC did release a First Look that sees Eggold getting emotional as he reflects on the final season of\u00a0New Amsterdam.  A post shared by New Amsterdam (@nbcnewamsterdam) \"I can't believe we're here five seasons in and it's already our fifth and final season,\" he said, \"and just an excitement to bring the show to a close and to sort of put a period at the end of that sentence. You don't always get the opportunity to end the story so it's going to be an exciting last chapter.\" We don't have any photos from the episodes, yet.\nCreate a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive show news, updates, and more!

The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. The final took place in front of 88,966 supporters, with a record crowd of 1.5 billion people watching on television, becoming one of the most widely-watched televised sporting events in history.[3]  The tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2\u20131, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2\u20130. They then won against Australia in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out, and Croatia in the semi-final. France finished top of Group D with two wins and one loss (4\u20131 win over Australia, 2\u20131 win over Denmark, and a 1\u20130 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final and Morocco in the semi-final.\nIt did, according to the game\u2019s officials and England won 4-2.           The 1970 final marked Pel\u00e9\u2019s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil\u2019s swashbuckling victory over Italy.           Four years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team \u2013 made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens \u2013 to win its second World Cup.           Much like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.           In 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.            However, with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of \u2018greatest World Cup final.\u2019    \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.

The 2022 World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 quickly changed the course of the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had sealed their victory \u2014 until Mbapp\u00e9, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, blocked France's second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.\nUnder the management of Didier Deschamps, who won the 1998 tournament as a player, the French failed to conquer the 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euros 2016 and 2020, but successfully clinched the 2018 World Cup title.[12][13] Due to their status as the world champions, France also entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.[14] France aimed to emulate the achievement of Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 as the third country to successfully defend the World Cup title. Deschamps was seeking to become the second manager to win two men's FIFA World Cup titles, after Vittorio Pozzo with Italy in 1934 and 1938.[15] Having won the 1998 tournament as a player, Deschamps was also seeking to become the third person to win three FIFA World Cup titles, after Brazilian legends Pel\u00e9 (all as a player) and M\u00e1rio Zagallo (two as a player, one as a manager).[16][17]  The two nations met in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup. In 2018 in Russia at the Kazan Arena in the round of 16, France won the encounter 4\u20133 in what The Independent called \"one of the greatest World Cup games of all time\".\nIt is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin,[23] Jo'bulani,[24] Brazuca Final Rio,[25] and Telstar Mechta.[26]  The final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about 15 kilometres (9.3\u00a0mi) north of the city centre of Doha.[27] The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid,[28] and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020.[29] The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.[30]  Lusail Stadium, owned by the Qatar Football Association, was built as part of Qatar's winning bid for the World Cup. The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous,[31] supported by MANICA Architecture.[32] The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint.[33] Construction began in April 2017,[34] and was planned to finish in 2020. Completion of the stadium was postponed, with construction ultimately finished in November 2021.[35] The stadium hosted its first match, the Lusail Super Cup, on 9 September 2022,[36] later than expected.[37]\nQuestion:Who won the World Cup Final in 2022?\nAnswer:"

Higgins had three live segments                during the hour-long broadcast, plus a quick intro at the beginning of the show. During                the breaks, he and his camera person offered tips and tricks of the trade on live                broadcasting.\u00a0 \u201cIt was amazing to see how Chris and Lou were able to work together when an obstacle                popped up,\u201d said freshman Evelyn Maruszak.\u00a0 Maruszak\u2019s goal is a career in broadcast meteorology. \u201cThis broadcast course has been such a wonderful opportunity, and it is so special\nI left KSDK and St. Louis in 1990 to work for KRON-TV in San Francisco. Now\u00a0\u2022 I serve as chief meteorologist for NBC 4 New York, delivering weather reports for the station's 5 p.m., 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. I was inducted as a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society in 2020 and am a member of the New York State Broadcasters Association\u2019s Hall of Fame. I have provided weather information to tri-state viewers for more than 25 years. I joined NBC 4 New York in January 1995 and held a variety of positions at NBC. I came to WNBC from KRON-TV, the NBC affiliate in San Francisco, where I was the primary on-air meteorologist for the station since 1991. I\u2019m a native of Manhattan and graduated from Florida State University at Tallahassee with a major in meteorology. I am married and live in New Jersey. Then\u00a0\u2022 I worked at KSDK from 2016-2019 and had the pleasure of working with Cindy Preszler and Mike Roberts for a short time. It was an honor to learn from them and to spend so much time with Scott Connell and Craig Moeller during my time at Channel 5. I am grateful for their expertise in forecasting St. Louis' fickle weather.\nThen\u00a0\u2022 In 1976, I became the first certified meteorologist on nightly local newscasts in St. Louis on KSDK-TV at age 22. This career was my dream since third grade when I became fascinated with weather. I was hired while in graduate school focusing on thunderstorm research. On the air, I integrated moving, color radar graphics with scientific explanations in forecasts. I hold the record for severe weather, live continuous coverage\u00a0\u2014 staying on-air for more than 8 hours in April 2011. By the time I was 29, I became chief meteorologist for ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cWorld News This Morning\u201d in New York. But I missed severe weather forecasting and returned to KTVI-TV in 1990. After a career total of 12 Emmy awards, I retired after 42 years in television in 2018. Now\u00a0\u2022 Weather is still a big part of my life. I can be heard on radio daily, live on \u201cThe Dave Glover Show\u201d on 97.1 FM, on \u201cThe Viper\u201d 100.7 FM station in St. Charles and on KBDZ FM\u2019s \u201cJ.C. Corcoran in the Morning.\u201d My Facebook page, Dave Murray\u2019s Weather, has nearly 100,000 followers. There, I answer questions in addition to daily and seasonal forecasting. I work from a small studio at home.\nInsurance companies and the legal system rely on meteorologists to be an expert witness and attest to the accuracy of the weather information. Also, this year I will be getting more involved in commercial work and corporate speaking roles. While spinning several plates in various areas may not be as glamorous as being a TV weatherman, it has allowed me to do something very important and meaningful\u00a0\u2014 being more involved in my daughter\u2019s life. Then\u00a0\u2022 I came to KSDK in 1987 from WRBL-TV in Columbus, Georgia. I was the morning and noon meteorologist on \"Today in St. Louis\" with Jennifer Blome and Art Holliday. I also worked with other legends there, like Karen Foss, Huel Perkins and John Fuller. During my time in St. Louis, I was awarded an Emmy for best weathercaster in 1988. Some of my favorite memories and places to visit were the Gateway Arch, Forest Park, the St. Louis Zoo, the Missouri Botanical Garden, Union Station, restaurants on the Hill, St. Louis Cardinals baseball games at the old Busch Stadium, and listening to live blues music at the numerous clubs throughout the city. I would also make occasional trips to Chicago, Kansas City, Detroit and Indianapolis. Some of my favorite local foods were toasted ravioli and concretes from Ted Drewes. My all-time fave were the buffalo wings and fries at Culpepper\u2019s in the Central West End.\nQuestion:Who is the chief meteorologist for KPLR-TV?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Texas Tech agreed to pay former women's basketball coach Marlene Stollings a little more than $740,000 as part of a settlement of a lawsuit in which\u00a0she accused the school and\u00a0its athletics director, Kirby Hocutt, of discrimination and retaliation, according to a copy of the settlement agreement USA TODAY Sports obtained from the university through a public records request. The school fired Stollings for cause in August 2020, the day after the publication of\u00a0an investigation by USA TODAY Sports and The Intercollegiate, a college sports investigative media outlet. Players alleged there was a culture of abuse under Stollings and\u00a0described a toxic culture that generated \"fear, anxiety and depression.\" In her lawsuit, Stollings\u00a0argued that two internal reviews conducted by the school before the investigation was published cleared her of the allegations. STAY UP TO DATE:Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now! The lawsuit, filed in October 2020, was settled on Aug. 10. The settlement shows Stollings received $300,000 for alleged compensatory damages, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish and\u00a0loss of enjoyment of life. She received $300,000 for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Stollings, plus an additional $140,666.00 for back wages, according to the agreement.\n\u201cUnfortunately, but not surprisingly,\u00a0TTU (Texas Tech University) only leaked a part of the agreement,\u2019\u2019 attorney Peter Ginsberg, who represented Stollings, told USA TODAY Sports by text message. \u201cBut we, unlike TTU, take our obligations and promises seriously and we will not be saying more.\u00a0TTU is what it is.\u00a0Marlene has lots to be proud of - and too much integrity to play TTU\u2019s game.\u2019\u2019 Ginsberg did not clarify what part of the agreement he alleges Texas Tech withheld. Robert Giovannetti, Senior Associate Athletics Director/External Operations & Strategic Communications, responded, \"We produced the agreement pursuant to an open records request, which was allowed by the settlement agreement.'' At the time of her dismissal, Stollings was under contract through March 2024. She was due to be paid $720,000 in basic annual compensation from the school for the 2019-20 season and was\u00a0due $740,000 for 2020-21, according to copies of the agreement obtained by USA TODAY Sports and the Intercollegiate. Termination without cause would entitle Stollings to 75% of her remaining basic annual compensation, a total surpassing $2 million.\u00a0 She has been out of coaching since her termination at Texas Tech. Last week Texas Tech announced a contract extension for Hocutt\u00a0through Aug.\nTexas Tech and Marlene Stollings, fired as the head women\u2019s basketball coach in August 2020 after a USA TODAY Sports investigation into the program, have settled a lawsuit in which Stollings accused the school and athletics director Kirby Hocutt of discrimination and retaliation.\u00a0 Texas Tech fired Stollings the day after an investigation by USA TODAY Sports and The Intercollegiate, a college sports investigative media outlet, was published. Players alleged there was a culture of abuse under Stollings and\u00a0described a toxic culture that generated \"fear, anxiety and depression.\" Stollings\u00a0argued in her lawsuit that two internal reviews conducted by the school before the investigation was published cleared her of the allegations. Stollings sued Texas Tech in October 2020 and the case was scheduled to go to trial in February 2023. The two sides on Wednesday filed a joint motion to settle, and a judge on Thursday dismissed the case. Terms of the settlement were not immediately available.\u00a0The school cannot comment on the settlement, according to Robert Giovannetti, Texas\u00a0Tech\u2019s Senior Associate Athletics Director of External Operations & Strategic Communications. Stollings was under contract through March 2024 at the time of her dismissal.\nLUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Former Lady Raider basketball coach Marlene Stollings reached a settlement with Texas Tech University and Athletic Director Kirby Hocutt this week, ending the civil case that claimed discrimination, fraud, defamation and breach of contract after she was fired. The claim was dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d meaning it cannot be filed in court again. Athletics Director Kirby Hocutt terminated Stollings in 2020 after reports of hostile and inappropriate environments in the basketball program. MORE: Report alleges toxic environment, sexual harassment within Lady Raiders basketball program Stollings believes she was fired without cause in August 2020 and retained attorney Peter Ginsberg to pursue litigation against the school. The complaint alleged nine claims for relief, including breach of contract, defamation, fraud, and violations of Title IX protections. Part of Stollings\u2019 complaint also alleges that the decision to terminate her was discriminatory, claiming she was penalized for identifying as LGTBQ, and employing \u201cthe same demanding and effective coaching techniques that male coaches at the school utilized, and continue to utilize, without consequence.\u201d In March 2022, a federal judge once again threw out most of Marlene Stollings\u2019 lawsuits against Texas Tech. The former Lady Raider basketball coach made new claims for damages late last year and refiled her original ones related to her firing in 2020.\nIn his opinion filed in March, dismissing most of the causes for action, Judge James Hendrix said they\u2019re no more valid (in March) than they were when he dismissed them in 2021. Out of Stollings\u2019 13 complaints against the university and Hocutt, only two remained: retaliation under Title IX, and discrimination. A jury trial was scheduled for this case in September 2022, but that case was terminated on Thursday. On Wednesday, Stollings posted the following on Twitter: \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddec, equality wins! Settled! Brought this case to clear my name, set the record straight & contribute to principles of equality & fair treatment. Thrilled! Worth the fight! Grateful to so many including SA\u2019s, parents & TTU fans. Eager to return to my life\u2019s work! The Tweet says, \u201cTODAY, equality wins! Settled!

Kadokawa Corporation, the Tokyo-based media corporation that owns FromSoftware, announced in a news release that Sony and Tencent had both purchased significant shares in FromSoftware. Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware\u2019s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent. Kadokawa still maintains majority ownership at 69.66 percent. In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a \u201cstrategic alliance in the anime and game fields\u201d since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware\u2019s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony. \u201cThrough the implementation of the fund procurement,\u201d Kadokawa wrote in its press release, \u201cFromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware\u2019s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market.\nAug 31, 2022 ... Kadokawa will retain a 69.66% majority stake in FromSoftware . Sixjoy will buy 1,703 shares for 11,450,000 yen (about US$82,533) per share, and\u00a0...\nThe year of acquisitions and shareholding antics continues.\u00a0 Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year\u2019s mega-hit, Elden Ring.\u00a0 This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software\u2019s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.\u00a0 \u201cThrough the implementation of the fund procurement, From Software will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen From Software\u2019s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market,\u201d a press release reads.\nThe Souls games by FromSoftware ranked, including \u2018Elden Ring\u2019 Dark Souls (FromSoftware\u2019s most recognizable action role-playing series), \u201cBloodborne\u201d and \u201cSekiro: Shadows Die Twice\u201d are all brutally punishing games. Despite this, the studio\u2019s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as \u201cStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,\u201d \u201cGod of War\u201d and \u201cThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\u201d Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware\u2019s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following \u2014 but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company\u2019s games as alienating. That perception changed with \u201cElden Ring.\u201d FromSoftware\u2019s most recent title, made in collaboration with \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware\u2019s approach in \u201cElden Ring,\u201d which made the game more accessible than the studio\u2019s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after \u201cElden Ring,\u201d it\u2019s now seen as a hitmaker.\nWouldn't mind a Bloodborne 2  @Omnistalgic Help From? They are helping themselves by raking in the $$$ from FromSoftware's success  Meanwhile fans are still waiting for Bloodborne Remastered on PS5 & PC...give them a bone please.  @Art_Vandelay that\u2019s facts. However, people can still voice their opinion on the subject. You don\u2019t have to stay silent when you don\u2019t agree with something  From my POV, this is a waste of time for me because FromSoftware haven't made a good game since Tenchu.  @NeThZOR They could have likely had the studio be a part of WWS if they pursued them further after Demon's souls. Big difference.  @theMEGAniggle That is definitely why we're here. But what almost always happens is that people love to whine and pretend to hate the evil greedy corporation but when push comes to shove, they don't put their money where their mouth is. And hence that negativity for negativity's sake unnecessarily gets in the way of our enjoyment of this great form of entertainment.  @Art_Vandelay real talk  Tap here to load 59 comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\nQuestion:Who acquired a stake in FromSoftware?\nAnswer:"

The American Song Contest co-host previously shared that she wanted to spend more time with her kids (8-year-old daughter River and 6-year-old son Remington) \u2014 even if it meant switching up her schedule to do so.\nWe've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years.

NEW YORK \u2014 Leave it to Serena Williams to not want to go quietly, to not want this match, this trip to the U.S. Open, this transcendent career of hers, to really, truly end. Right down to what were, barring a change of heart, the final minutes of her quarter-century of excellence on the tennis court, and an unbending unwillingness to be told what wasn't possible, Williams tried to mount one last classic comeback, earn one last vintage victory, with fans on their feet in a full Arthur Ashe Stadium, cellphone cameras at the ready. The 23-time Grand Slam champion staved off five match points to prolong the three-hours-plus proceedings, but could not do more, and was eliminated from the U.S. Open in the third round by Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 on Friday night in what is expected to be her final contest. \"I've been down before. ...\nRELATED VIDEO: Serena Williams Wins First Round Match at US Open After Shaky Start: 'I Want to Do My Best'   Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

In her second match since announcing she would retire from professional tennis, Serena Williams lost to Emma Raducanu at the Western & Southern Open in Ohio on Tuesday.   Williams lost in straight sets to the British tennis player during the 65-minute match, according to the Washington Post. Raducanu, 19, won the match 6-4, 6-0.   It's widely expected that Williams' next tournament, the U.S. Open later this month, will be the final one of her storied career. The 23-time Grand Slam champion said she planned to \"evolve away from tennis\" after the New York City tournament in an essay for Vogue on August 9.   After the match, Raducanu paid tribute to Williams and all she has accomplished.   \"I think we all need to just honor Serena and her amazing career,\" she said, per CNN.\nThey lost yesterday evening\u2014and Venus is out of the singles tournament, too, losing her first round match in straight sets to Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck. Williams, who is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players ever, struggled with her decision to retire, telling Meghan Markle, \"I've been doing this since I was\u2014since I can remember. And I'm 40 years old now, so it's like my whole entire being and my whole entire life has been for one purpose. So to kind of not do that anymore, it's exciting, right? I'm really looking forward to it.\" Williams made her professional debut in 1995, soon after she turned 14. She won her first U.S. Open in 1999\u2014she would go on to win the New York tournament five more times\u2014and racked up 23 Grand Slam titles during her career. Her pursuit for a 24th Slam, to tie Margaret Court's record, has been the dominate narrative of her past few years on tour.  Famous faces in the stands at Arthur Ashe Stadium to watch Williams's final tournament have included her husband Alexis Ohanian; her daughter, Olympia; Tiger Woods, who Williams wrote in Vogue encouraged her to get back on the court this past spring; and more. \"I'm just so grateful to every single person who has ever said 'Go Serena' in their life.

Williams gave away leads in each set, including the last, in which she was up 1-0 before dropping the final six games.

At about 1:30 a.m., police received reports of a crash in the center median of the parkway's southbound lanes in Englewood Cliffs, a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey,\u00a0the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said in a statement. When officers arrived at the scene, they found \"a single vehicle accident rollover\"\u00a0and several passengers trapped in the vehicle. Four of the passengers suffered \"severe trauma\" and were pronounced dead at the scene while eight others were hospitalized\u00a0with injuries ranging from severe head trauma to minor physical complaints, police said. Police did not immediately identify the victims. The shuttle van, listed as a Ford Econoline E350 passenger cargo van with New York registration, takes people to and from factories in upstate New York, police said. The van was carrying 12 passengers at the time of the crash. The crash also snarled traffic as the southbound lanes of the parkway remained closed Friday morning. The cause of the crash is under investigation by parkway police, the Bergen County Sheriff's Office and other agencies.\nFour people -- three of them Party City employees -- died and another eight were hurt, some of them severely, when a shuttle van with a dozen aboard flipped over in the center median of New Jersey's Palisades Interstate Parkway early Friday, authorities and the company said. Highway police responding to a call about a southbound incident in Englewood Cliffs found a mangled Ford cargo van with New York plates flipped on its left side in a wooded area off the span around 1:30 a.m. Several people were trapped, they said. Emergency crews had to extricate them from the vehicle. Its roof had been shorn off, its back windows smashed, but it wasn't clear how much of the damage happened as a result of the accident and how much may have been part of the rescue effort. \"Injuries range from minor to severe. Witnesses inside the vehicle said that the driver appeared to be having a medical emergency just prior to the accident when he left the left side of the road,\" Lt. Raymond Walter of the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said. Police say the four people who died at the scene had suffered severe trauma. The driver, identified by police as 54-year-old George Massey Jr. of the Bronx, was among the dead. Officials said no one was wearing seat belts.  Eight victims were taken to hospitals, some with severe head trauma and others with minor complaints, officials said.\nParty City, a company that sells party goods, said in a statement some of the victims were employees with its Chester Distribution Center but confirmed the driver was not a company employee.  \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we can confirm our Chester Distribution Center team suffered the loss of three valued team members early this morning,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are deeply saddened to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team members injured in the accident,\u201d the statement continued. Video footage from the scene showed the vehicle on its side near a tree.  The cause of the accident is under investigation by parkway police, the Bergen County Sheriff\u2019s Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Bergen County Prosecutors Office Fatal Accident Unit. Police said in a news release that southbound lanes of the Palisades Interstate Parkway are closed at exit 2 and all traffic is being diverted to the southbound lanes of Route 9W.\nIt wasn't clear how many survivors had life-threatening injuries early Friday. The shuttle was transporting factory workers from the Amscan Distribution Center in the Orange County town of Chester to New York City. Party City confirmed it lost three employees.   \"It is with heavy hearts that we can confirm our Chester Distribution Center team suffered the loss of three valued team members early this morning,\" the party company said in a statement Friday. \"We are deeply saddened to hear of the tragic car accident that occurred and offer our most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those affected. We pray for the recovery and healing of the additional team members injured in the accident.\" A spokesperson said the van is not owned or operated by the company, but did not provide further details.  It wasn't clear if everyone else aboard worked for the same company. Family members of two women who had been on the van said it was transporting workers from the Chester factory of a major party goods manufacturer to Manhattan's Inwood neighborhood, where workers were set to be dropped off at an employment agency.  Clara Estrella had recently immigrated from the Dominican Republic with her sister. Her cousins confirmed the 49-year-old was one of the four victims killed in the mangled Econoline shuttle van.  \"She was a beautiful person. She came over here to have a better life,\" the victim's cousin, Nathaly Paulino, said.\nThe van served as a shuttle \"for workers in factories in upstate New York,\" police said in Friday's release.   Family members of two female victims told NBC New York that the shuttle was bringing workers back to New York City from Chester. Family members told the outlet the factory was for \"a major global designer and manufacturer of party goods.\"   Police also said the passengers were returning home from work and would be dropped off in the Tri-State area, according to WPIX.   It is unclear what caused the crash, police said in Friday's release. An investigation into the incident is underway.   The southbound lanes of the highway were briefly closed for motorists, beginning at Exit 2, as officials investigated the crash early Friday morning, according to WPIX.   Police said the lanes have since reopened.\nQuestion:How many people were injured in the shuttle van accident on Palisades Interstate Parkway?\nAnswer:"

(1:10) Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry has been named the new head football coach at Virginia Tech, the Hokies announced Tuesday. Pry, 51, replaces former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went 43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech,\" Pry said in a statement released by the school. \"Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the nation. \"Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources, facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys made this a very desirable situation.\nThe Virginia Tech Hokies college football team represents Virginia Tech in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente\u2019s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach\u2019s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020, maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation of Tech. Chris Slade\u2019s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making \u201cEven though not many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell you they know Coach Beamer,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cThey have met him, they affiliate with him, because they want to know the head football coach.\u201d Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also hired Radford native Mike Young as men\u2019s basketball coach in 2019. But he has been wary of how native-son and former-assistant narratives can sour quickly if there aren\u2019t results.\nBLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Virginia Tech football\u2019s Beamerball \u2014 an idiosyncratic mix of Tidewater talent, special teams wizardry and Metallica entrances \u2014 made the Hokies a national brand, and Brent Pry was there. \u201cThis was Clemson before Clemson was Clemson,\u201d Pry said. Pry, a graduate assistant under legendary Hokies coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster from 1995 to 1997, left his defensive coordinator job at Penn State to sign a six-year contract as Virginia Tech\u2019s head coach in December. Now he\u2019s tasked with a balancing act of modernizing the program while maintaining the Beamer culture. And winning big. \u201cI was not trying to re-create \u2018Coach Beamer and Coach Bud 2.0,\u2019\u2009\u201d Athletic Director Whit Babcock said about hiring Pry. Virginia Tech is mindful of how it is messaging its second attempt at life after Beamer because the first one failed. When the program\u2019s architect and native son announced his retirement in 2015, Babcock moved swiftly to hire Justin Fuente, then the coach of a surging Memphis program and one of the hottest names in the industry.\nVirginia Tech quarterback Grant Wells (6) during Virginia Tech football practice Wednesday.

Joseph\u2019s first coaching job at the FBS level was as a graduate assistant at Tulane in 1999.\nIn eleven seasons as head coach, Devaney won two national championships, eight conference titles, and coached twenty-two All-Americans, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[4] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973, and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-form offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[5][6][7] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.  \u2020 Interim head coach  \u2021 Claimed national titles in bold  # denotes interim head coach\nThe Nebraska Cornhuskers football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln in the West Division of the Big Ten. The team is coached by Matt Rhule, who was named Nebraska's thirty-first head coach on November 26, 2022.[1]  Six past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Eddie N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, and Tom Osborne. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his .836 career winning percentage is fourth-highest in major college football history.[2] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles.  The program's first extended period of success came under the leadership of W.C. Cole and Ewald O. Stiehm. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four consecutive games without a loss, still a program record.[3] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Devaney was hired in 1962.\nGreen (@RonnieDGreen) September 11, 2022  (1/3) We\u2019re grateful for everything Scott Frost has done for the University of Nebraska and the Huskers \u2014 as a player, coach and leader of our young men.

Ever since being the runner-up to America\u2019s Got Talent way back in 2011, it\u2019s been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn\u2019t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is undervalued, to say the least. Jackie\u2019s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence\u2013 highlighting her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she\u2019s covered not in English as well. On the whole, Jackie\u2019s music has touched millions of people around the world, mine inclusive, as well.\n219] Evancho performed three further concerts with Michael Feinstein at his eponymous club in New York in August 2019.[220] Evancho stated in 2019 that she was working with vocal coach Joan Lader.[221][222]  In 2020 Evancho began recording an album of covers of Joni Mitchell songs, produced by Fred Mollin,[223] at Sound Stage Studio in Nashville.[224] She released the disc, titled Carousel of Time, on September 9, 2022.[225] Before its release, Evancho introduced four singles from the album: \"River\" in October 2020,[226][227] \"Both Sides Now\" in May 2022,[223] \"A Case of You\" in July 2022,[228] and \"Blue\" in August 2022,[229] which she performed on Good Day New York in September[230] and WGN-TV in October.[231] Jill O'Rourke, reviewing the album for TalentRecap.com, wrote: \"Evancho brings a signature ethereal quality to Mitchell\u2019s music, as well as a clear emotional connection with the lyrics.\"[232]\nCarousel of Time is a Joni tribute album, and while I myself am only familiar (fully) with songs like \u2018Both Sides Now\u2019 and \u2018River\u2019, I\u2019ve since heard Jackie\u2019s interpretation of songs like \u2018Circle Game\u2019 and \u2018A Case of You\u2019, and I\u2019m reminded, of the timelessness of these songs, how songs from yesteryear can be covered and redone to create a sense of freshness that these songs would only have had, if it was covered and unveiled to a new generation of people, as a reminder that songs from yesteryear still have a place in current society. While it\u2019s still not known when Jackie\u2019s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it\u2019s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then. While the album unfortunately doesn\u2019t have \u2018Big Yellow Taxi\u2019 (a song that I reckon, is Joni\u2019s biggest radio hit), these 10 tracks still convey Joni\u2019s own impact and influence on music, full stop. While Jackie\u2019s been out for some time, it\u2019s great that she\u2019s able to return, and to return with a Joni tribute album, is one of the best ways to make a splash back into the music industry.\nSEE ALSO: JACKIE EVANCHO CONTINUES HER COMEBACK WITH ANOTHER JONI MITCHELL COVER Evancho recently chatted with Talent Recap about the new project, saying that Mitchell is an artist she\u2019s \u201cbeen very inspired by for a very long time.\u201d She added that something she loves about Mitchell is that she\u2019s \u201cso authentic.\u201d \u201cYou know, even for the time period, she did not care what anyone said, as long as she was content with the music,\u201d Evancho shared. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s appropriate for the point in my life that I\u2019m going through, and I\u2019m excited to see what everyone thinks of it.\u201d Evancho also shared that she\u2019s \u201cbeen doing a lot of songwriting,\u201d confirming that fans can expect another album of original songs at some point. As she said, \u201cI will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.\u201d The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie\u2019s incredible, ethereal voice.  Carousel of Time is now and will be remembered as one of her best gifts to the world. Thank you, Jackie.

But Carousel of Time is Jackie\u2019s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni\u2019s \u2018Both Sides Now\u2019 or \u2018River\u2019, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she\u2019s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you\u2019ve been a fan of Jackie\u2019s material in the past and are eager to see what she\u2019s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni\u2019s music (and Jackie\u2019s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here\u2019s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4.\nQuestion:What is the release date of Jackie Evancho's album Carousel of Time?\nAnswer:"

The MATANA group is composed of six high-level technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc. These giants are regarded as a powerful tech group driving many of the biggest innovations in the world. In terms of market dominance, the stocks of the MATANA group make up almost 50% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Therefore, these companies have a significant influence on the tech market\u2019s returns. This has led the MATANA group to replace the FAANG group as a reference in the tech industry.

Animated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year.[citation needed] The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994[1] while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009.[2] Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.  Prior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.[citation needed]\nBy subscribing, I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Animated shows have come a long way since their early days of Saturday morning cartoons. They have proven that they are not just for kids anymore, as they have become a beloved form of entertainment for all ages. Animation has the ability to tell unique stories and showcase breathtaking visuals that would be impossible in live-action shows. In fact, some animated shows have proven to be just as good, if not better, than their live-action counterparts. The Emmys have recognized the excellence of animated shows and have awarded them in their own category since 1974. Since then, animated shows have garnered numerous nominations and wins, with some programs dominating the category year after year. These shows are able to capture the imagination of audiences and transport them to worlds beyond their wildest dreams.

(1:56) Qatar became the first team eliminated at the 2022 World Cup after suffering defeats in their opening two fixtures, the earliest exit by a host nation in the tournament's 92-year history. Qatar, who were controversially awarded the hosting rights in 2010, became the first host country to lose the opening game of the tournament when they were beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday before losing 3-1 to Senegal on Friday. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) Their hopes of advancing to the knockout stages were ended on later on Friday when Netherlands draw 1-1 to Ecuador. Qatar face an uphill task of achieving a win in their final group game as they face Netherlands on Friday, with the European nation needing a win to guarantee qualification to the round of 16. South Africa (2010) are the only other host team to be eliminated in the group stage, although the African side at least went out with a win and a draw from their three games. \"If you expected us to go very far in this tournament, then it will be a disappointment,\" Qatar coach F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez said before his team was officially out. \"Our goal was to be competitive. \"We have to forget about today, move on and play the Netherlands.\nWorld Cup 30  Qatar had to wait 4371 days to play their first World Cup match on home soil after being announced as the hosts of the 2022 tournament by FIFA on December 2, 2010. And now the tournament they have waited so long for is over \u2014 in a sense \u2014 after just nine days. Qatar lost the opening match of the 2022 World Cup when they fell 2-0 to Ecuador. Advertisement That left them requiring a positive result against Senegal, the reigning African champions, in their second match of the tournament. But, despite an improved performance, Qatar were defeated again, losing 3-1, leaving them on the verge of being eliminated from their own tournament at the first hurdle. But are the hosts definitely out? And are they in danger of being the worst host nation in the 92-year history of the tournament? We take a look below. GO DEEPER The Radar - The Athletic's 2022 World Cup scouting guide Yes. Qatar\u2019s second loss leaves them bottom of Group A with zero points. The Netherlands and Ecuador are both on four points, while Senegal are on three. While Qatar could beat The Netherlands in their final game, they will not be able to overtake them. They also cannot overtake Ecuador, and if Senegal beat Ecuador to get second spot, then Qatar will not be able to catch them either. Third place is the best Qatar can hope for now.\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]  This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event\u2014their first World Cup\u2014automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.  Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4\u20132 on penalties following a 3\u20133 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002.\n16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4\u20132 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]  Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[2][21][25] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[5][26] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[27]  The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020.[28] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day.\n67] The Economist provided a defence for FIFA's choice, stating that Qatar was \"a more suitable country to host a big sporting event\" than both China and Russia, who hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup respectively, and both of whom arguably had worse human rights records. Moreover, it added that \"Western criticism\" failed to \"distinguish between truly repugnant regimes and merely flawed ones\", and that many \"indignant pundits\" simply sounded as if they did \"not like Muslims or rich people\".[333] The Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera news organization commented that Qatar's human rights positions had received selected, heightened criticism compared to other countries who had hosted similar events (such as Russia, China, and the United States), deeming the controversy to be hypocritical.[334][335] Incumbent FIFA president Gianni Infantino defended the hosting.[336]  A number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[337][338] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][324] worker conditions ,the rights of LGBT fans,[324] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[339][340][341] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nQuestion:Which team will host nation Qatar play against in the opening match of the 2022 World Cup?\nAnswer:"

Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as \u201cFat Leonard\u201d for his overshadowing frame, fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A multiagency search by the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force and Naval Criminal Investigative Service is underway, officials said. \u201cHe cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet on Sunday morning,\u201d the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. \u201cTask Force Officers went to his residence and upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.\u201d The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies \u201cto locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,\u201d a service spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cOut of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time,\u201d the spokesperson added.  Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at Francis\u2019s home, Supervisory Deputy Omar Castillo with the U.S. Marshals\u2019 district in Southern California told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cHe was planning this out, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Castillo told the newspaper, which was the first to report Francis\u2019s escape. Castillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\nUnknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property \u2013 he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents \u2013 for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks \u201ccoming in and out of the residence,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThere was more than one\u201d seen on Friday or Saturday. Undated photo of Leonard Francis \u201cWe are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of now, we think he\u2019s probably going international. It sounds like he\u2019s been planning this for a while.\u201d Castillo said he didn\u2019t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis\u2019 residence.\u00a0He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. \u201cI can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was there.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors\u2019 support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis\u2019 residence.\nSince pleading guilty in 2015, Francis has worked as a cooperating witness for federal prosecutors building cases against others involved in the plot \u2014 and shared evidence, including records from Glenn Defense Marine Asia\u2019s computer servers. The man who seduced the 7th Fleet Following health complications \u2014 including a bout with kidney cancer, swollen knees and a hernia, according to court records \u2014 Francis was released from federal detention in 2018 and has been held under house arrest. His home is under surveillance by a security entourage for which he pays. But that arrangement was one that prosecutors had fought against in 2013 and 2015 \u2014 arguing that he might try fleeing for the Mexican border, The Post reported. That\u2019s one of the scenarios authorities are contending with almost a decade later. Castillo told the Union-Tribune that international borders and airports are on alert, but Francis might have already crossed into Mexico. Craig Whitlock contributed to this report. A previous version of this story stated that the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Leonard Glenn Francis might have crossed the Rio Grande, according to a U.S. Marshals Service official. The paper reported Francis might have crossed into Mexico. The story has been updated.\nNearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.  Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer\u2019s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis\u2019 ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: \u201cAt this time, I have no comment, sorry.\u201d Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up \u201cback in Malaysia for whatever reason,\u201d her name would come up if anyone asked \u201cwho let somebody do this without any security,\u201d according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.  She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.\n\u201cI was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,\u201d Sammartino added, according to the transcript. \u201cSo that\u2019s the only thing. It\u2019s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.\u201d Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis\u2019s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. \u201cLeonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,\u201d Mancano said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s lived his life. So he\u2019s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn\u2019t planning [his escape] for a long time.\nQuestion:Where did Leonard Francis escape from?\nAnswer:"

The next platform and medium will be even more immersive, an embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse. And you\u2019re going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine, get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create as well as entirely new categories that don\u2019t really fit how we think about computers or phones today. Now, since we\u2019re doing this remotely today, I figured let\u2019s make this special. Mark Zuckerberg: (00:39) So we\u2019ve put together something that I think is really going to give you a feeling for what this future could be like. We believe the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. We\u2019ll be able to feel present like we\u2019re right there with people no matter how far apart we actually are.\nCheck your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.            The other two talks deal with advancements in the Voice SDK (voice control) and Interaction SDK (hand interactions, hand tracking). In the latter, a new hand tracking version numbered 2.1 will be introduced. Two other sessions deal with synergies between Horizon Worlds and Crayta. Meta acquired the collaborative 2D game builder in June 2021 . A year later, Meta made Crayta available on Facebook Gaming. As a result, the platform now runs via cloud streaming in the browser and on smartphones. The know-how of the Crayta studio is likely to flow into the mobile version of Horizon Worlds, which is to be launched this year. From one of the two presentations, it's apparent that Meta wants more collaboration between the two Metaverse platforms. From another, how Meta avatars found their way into Crayta. Meta is apparently exploring how a metaverse that encompasses both computing paradigms (2D and virtual reality) might work. One talk on Meta avatars provides insight into recent developments in the SDK as well as upcoming enhancements. Another is dedicated to the vision and roadmap of Meta avatars. Zuckerberg already announced a tech upgrade for Horizon Worlds and Meta avatars, which will be presented at Meta Connect 2022. Two other presentations will focus on WebXR, which could play a more important role for Meta in the future.\nQuestion:When did Meta Connect take place?\nAnswer:"

Meta is facing a fine of 405 million euros, or just over $400 million, from Ireland's Data Protection Commission for failing to safeguard children's information on Instagram.\u00a0 The country's data watchdog had accused Instagram of setting children's accounts to \"public\" by default and allowing children to operate business accounts on the platform, which could leave their phone numbers and email addresses exposed. Full details of the decision are expected to be published next week, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.\u00a0 Meta confirmed the fine and said it plans to appeal the decision.\u00a0 \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told CNET via email on Tuesday. \"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can't message teens who don't follow them.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson added that Meta disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is reviewing the rest of the commission's decision. The $400 million fine would be the second-largest issued to a tech company for a violation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, behind Amazon's record-setting $888 million fine in 2021.\nJump to        Ireland's data watchdog the Data Protection Commission handed Meta a 405 million euro ($403 million) fine on Monday, the agency confirmed to Insider. The Irish DPC acts as the EU's regulator for several US tech giants including Meta because their headquarters are based in the country. The DPC fine was given to Instagram for failing to protect children's privacy on its platform. The fine was partly based on the fact Instagram had allowed children to operate business accounts on its platform. Instagram business accounts show the account holder's phone number and email address, meaning that data was exposed. The DPC also found the accounts of 13 to 17 year-olds were set to \"public\" as their default setting. A DPC spokesperson told Insider full details of the ruling will be published next week. A Meta spokesperson told Insider in a statement: \"This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we've since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private.\" The spokesperson added Instagram users under the age of 18 automatically have their accounts set to \"private\" rather than \"public.\" He added adult users can't privately message users under 18 unless they follow the adult's account. \"While we've engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it. We're continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision,\" the spokesperson added.\nWelcome to ComplianceWeek.com. This site uses cookies. Read our policy.     By Neil Hodge2022-09-06T19:30:00+01:00 Instagram is set to be fined 405 million euros (U.S. $401 million) by Ireland\u2019s data protection regulator for failing to adequately secure teenage users\u2019 data in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The penalty will be the largest to date handed down by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the primary European data regulator for the social media giant. It is the third fine in the past year against a subsidiary of Meta, following sanctions of \u20ac17 million (then-U.S. $18.6 million) in March against Meta Ireland (formerly Facebook Ireland) and \u20ac225 million (then-U.S. $267 million) in September 2021 against WhatsApp. The Instagram fine will be the second largest imposed under the GDPR, behind a \u20ac746 million (U.S. $739 million) penalty weighed against Amazon in Luxembourg last year. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Irish DPC confirmed it adopted its final decision Friday regarding the Instagram fine. Full details in the case are expected to be published next week. A spokesperson for Meta said the company intends to appeal the decision. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.\nEdwards, who began his five-year term as commissioner in January, said the ICO was also looking at more than 50 other online services to see if they were complying with data laws relating to children. He said the ICO had several ongoing investigations. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that our work to better protect children online involves working with organisations but will also involve enforcement action where necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are currently looking into how over 50 different online services are conforming with the children\u2019s code and have six ongoing investigations looking into companies providing digital services who have not, in our initial view, taken their responsibilities around child safety seriously enough.\u201d The Instagram owner, Meta, was fined \u20ac405m (\u00a3349m) by the Irish data watchdog this month for letting teenagers set up accounts that publicly displayed their phone numbers and email addresses. In May, the ICO fined the facial recognition company Clearview AI \u00a37.5m \u2013 the third largest it has imposed \u2013 for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The ICO ordered the US-based firm to delete the data of UK people from its systems. The company has collected more than 20bn images of people\u2019s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web.\nThe fine is the second-biggest issued to a tech company under Europe's GDPR data protection laws. The largest was a $887 million fine issued to Amazon\u00a0in July 2021. Meta is starting to rack up DPC fines. The DPC fined the tech giant 17 million euros ($16.9 million) in March 2022 for failing to protect user data from breaches. It also fined Meta subsidiary WhatsApp $266 million in September 2021 for not being transparent enough with users about how their data was shared with its parent company.

The game was originally planned to be released in 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S,[34] but was delayed to 2022.[35][36] The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were later cancelled.[31] The game was released on October 21.[37]  A comic book limited series\u2014written by Evan Narcisse and illustrated by ABEL\u2014titled Batman: Gotham Knights \u2013 Gilded City, serves as a tie-in and a prequel to Gotham Knights, exploring Batman's final case before his death. It was released on October 25 the same year, with subsequent issues releasing monthly.[38] Each issue of the limited series came with a code for an in-game item, as well as a seventh item given to those who purchase all six issues of the comic book.[39]  Gotham Knights received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[41][42][40] Game Informer praised the game for its co-op gameplay, but criticized its mission objectives, combat, and side activities.\nGotham Knights is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by WB Games Montr\u00e9al and published by Warner Bros. Games. Inspired by the Batman: Gotham Knights comic series and based on the DC Comics character Batman and his supporting cast, the game focuses on the characters Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood as they attempt to restore justice to Gotham City during a period of decline in the immediate aftermath of Batman's death. While investigating the events that led to their mentor's demise, the heroes become embroiled in an ancient conflict between two secret organizations fighting for control of Gotham: the Court of Owls and the League of Shadows.  Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character's traversal and combat abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. Players can freely move around Gotham City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and gaining experience points and other resources to level up their characters and equipment. Outside of the story, players are able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. A cooperative online multiplayer mode is also included, allowing two players to play through the single-player campaign together while progressing in their own game.  Gotham Knights was released on October 21, 2022, for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. Versions for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled.\nWith Batman and Commissioner Gordon dead, the Gotham Knights must rise up... The Gotham Knights release date is finally arriving this week, and everyone can soon play through the latest foray into Gotham City. Without Batman or Commissioner Gordon to protect the city following their deaths, the task is instead left up to the Bat-Family of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and the Red Hood. In your way stands the mysterious secret society the Court of Owls. It's a decent game, too. In our three-star Gotham Knights review, we called it \"a mixed bag\" but noted that, \"once you stop comparing it to Arkham in your head\", you should find plenty to enjoy. Enough of our babbling, here's everything you need to know about Gotham Knights from its release date and trailers to how to pre-order it for yourself. Plus, is it on Game Pass? The Gotham Knights release date will take place on 21st October 2022, the developers have confirmed. You can buy your copy from the likes of Amazon. The game has already seen a number of different release dates come and go, but it looks like the delays are over and this one will stick! For console players, the Gotham Knights launch time in the UK is midnight BST, just as the clock ticks over to 21st October. PC players, meanwhile, have to wait until 5pm on 21st October to play the co-op game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store.\nIn fact, Batman's live-action origins can be tracked all the way back to the 1960s, when Adam West's version of the titular character inhabited a goofy and cartoony tone that would slowly fade away with progressively darker stories. Speaking of cartoony, animation has also proven to be a viable medium for the Batman, with Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995) being the undisputed king of many fantastic animated adaptations. Matt Reeves's Batverse is also set to enter a television format with spin-offs centering on Colin Farrell's Penguin and the iconic Arkham Asylum. We'll finally find out if the new series can live beyond Batman when the show finally premieres later this Spring, but until then, here is everything we know so far about Gotham Knights.

He was 68.   \u201cHe went peacefully at home with his wife of 34 years, sister Joan, and daughters Lydia Hearst and Gillian Hearst-Simonds, along with [her] husband Christian Simonds by his side,\u201d the rep says. \u201cHe was loved deeply by his family and adored by everyone who had the pleasure of meeting and knowing him.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  This happens to be a day when journalists around the world are covering a big breaking news story.ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  And it's a day we're pausing to remember a pioneering journalist who mastered the craft, Bernard Shaw. The longtime former news anchor died yesterday.BERNARD SHAW: I wanted to be the best broadcast journalist I could be. In all the years of preparing to become an anchor, one of the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking out.CHANG: That's Shaw, also a former Marine, telling our NPR co-host Michel Martin about his ambitions back in 2014. His career began in his hometown, Chicago. He went on to report for CBS, ABC and in 1980 became the first chief anchor for a fledgling network called CNN.SHAPIRO: When the 1991 Gulf War began, he reported from Baghdad as bombs were going off.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHAW: Something is happening outside. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing. The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated.\n20] Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.[6]  Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.\n12] Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;[13] thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.[14]  Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.[15][n 3] His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"[16] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.[6] During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".[n 4]  In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.[6][n 5] Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up.\nSep 9, 2022 ... He died of pneumonia, unrelated to COVID-19, on Sept. 7 at a hospital in Washington, D.C., according to Tom Johnson, CNN's former chief\u00a0...\nQuestion:How did Bernard Shaw die?\nAnswer:"

She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.  Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George\u00a0VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward\u00a0VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\nQueen Elizabeth II died of old age, her death certificate has revealed.           The document, published by National Records of Scotland on Thursday, says the late British monarch died at 3:10 p.m. UK time (10:10 a.m. ET) on September 8 at Balmoral Castle in Ballater, Scotland.           The cause of death is listed as old age. The document is signed by the Queen\u2019s daughter, Princess Anne.            Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch died peacefully aged 96.           Her death set into motion a period of national mourning. King Charles III, who ascended to the throne following his mother\u2019s death, was formally proclaimed as the United Kingdom\u2019s new monarch on September 10.           Charles paid tribute to his mother\u2019s historic seven-decade reign, calling it \u201cunequaled in its duration, its dedication and its devotion.\u201d            \u201cEven as we grieve, we give thanks for this most faithful life,\u201d he said during the historic ceremony at St James\u2019s Palace.            Global leaders acknowledged the global impact the Queen had made during her 70-year reign, and the world bid farewell to the monarch on September 19 in a state funeral steeped in pageantry.     Why the Royal Vault isn't the Queen's final resting place\nQueen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning British monarch whose rule spanned seven decades, died on Thursday at the age of 96, Buckingham Palace has announced.           The Queen\u2019s oldest son Charles has now become King Charles III.           \u201cThe Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow,\u201d the royal family said in a statement posted on its official Twitter account, referring to Charles as the new King for the first time.            The King said in a statement that the Queen\u2019s death was \u201ca moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.\u201d     Elizabeth II: \u202fThe British Queen who weathered war and upheaval dies at 96         \u201cWe mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world,\u201d he said in the statement.           Crowds of mourners gathered outside Balmoral Castle and other royal residences, despite heavy downpours in parts of the UK on Thursday evening. Many brought flowers and lit candles, some looking visibly shaken by the news.           In keeping with the royal tradition, a written statement announcing the Queen\u2019s death was displayed on the gates of Buckingham Palace.\n249] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7\u00a0September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[250]  Elizabeth never planned to abdicate,[251] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[252] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition. Although, I suppose if I became completely gaga, one would have to do something\".[253] In June 2022, Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who \"came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength.\"[254]  On 8\u00a0September 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\"[255][256] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.[257][258] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side.\nTwo days before her death, on 6 September 2022, the Queen accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson and appointed Liz Truss to succeed him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; these meetings took place at Balmoral Castle, rather than their usual location, Buckingham Palace.[22] At the meeting with Truss, the final public photos of the Queen were taken by Jane Barlow. Social media users were quick to observe the Queen\u2019s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, \u201cghostly\u201d appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen\u2019s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was \u201cin quite good spirits.\u201d On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30.\nQuestion:When did Queen Elizabeth II die?\nAnswer:"

She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death. Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history.  Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George\u00a0VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother Edward\u00a0VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\nBecky Sullivan                        Queen Elizabeth II pictured in 2012.

Queen Elizabeth II, whose seven decades on the throne of the United Kingdom was a longer reign than any other British monarch, has died at the age of 96. The queen \"died peacefully\" on Thursday afternoon at Balmoral Castle, her estate in the Scottish Highlands, royal family officials announced.  Her son Charles, 73, is now king and will be known as King Charles III. Officials said he remains at Balmoral and will return to London on Friday.  The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon.The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/VfxpXro22W \"The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,\" the king said in a statement. \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\" Camilla, his second wife, will be known as queen consort.  Elizabeth had been placed under medical supervision earlier Thursday, officials said.\nAt various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardaman\u0121a, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]  As George\u00a0VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6\u00a0February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth\u00a0II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.\n249] The Queen's last public message was issued on 7\u00a0September to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.[250]  Elizabeth never planned to abdicate,[251] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[252] The Queen told Canadian governor-general Adrienne Clarkson in a meeting in 2002 that she would never abdicate, saying \"It is not our tradition. Although, I suppose if I became completely gaga, one would have to do something\".[253] In June 2022, Elizabeth met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who \"came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength.\"[254]  On 8\u00a0September 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\"[255][256] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.[257][258] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side.\n204] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13\u00a0October 2016,[205] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on 21\u00a0November 2017.[206] On 6\u00a0February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a sapphire jubilee,[207] and on 20\u00a0November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[208] Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August 2017.[209]  On 19\u00a0March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution.[210] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed \"HMS Bubble\".[211]  On 5\u00a0April, in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24\u00a0million viewers in the UK,[212] she asked people to \"take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\nQuestion:Where did Queen Elizabeth II die?\nAnswer:"

And what other pick could lead to a big return?\n[1/5]Sept 7, 2022; Flushing, NY, USA; Carlos Alcaraz of Spain hits to Jannik Sinner of Italy on day ten of the 2022 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Carlos Alcaraz saved a match point in the fourth set before digging deep in the decider to beat Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller and reach the U.S. Open semi-finals in the early hours of Thursday in New York. The Spanish teenager collapsed on his back after the match lasting more than five hours concluded at 2:50 a.m., beating the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014. The 6-3 6-7(7) 6-7(0) 7-5 6-3 win keeps alive Alcaraz's hopes of winning a maiden Grand Slam title and claiming the world number one ranking. \"Honestly I still don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz said in an on-court interview. \"The level that I played, the level of the match, the high quality of tennis. \"It's unbelievable.\nCarlos Alcaraz is one win away from a maiden grand slam title \u2013 and the world No 1 ranking \u2013 after outlasting Frances Tiafoe of the United States in a sensational five-set US Open semi-final on Friday night in New York. The 19-year-old Spaniard and sentient highlight reel, whose sublime shotmaking and dogged hustle have seen him tabbed as the new face of the sport, came from behind and held on from ahead in a 6-7 (6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-3 thriller to book a place in Sunday\u2019s final opposite fifth-seeded Casper Ruud, who battled past Karen Khachanov in the day\u2019s first semi-final. Up against an opponent brimming with confidence and the crackling Arthur Ashe Stadium atmosphere of nearly 24,000 spectators largely in the American\u2019s corner, Alcaraz conjured his best tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further building on his reputation as the best teenager in men\u2019s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two decades ago. For more than four hours Alcaraz and Tiafoe traded hellfire in physical baseline rallies and tested their ample movement to the limit in dazzling cat-and-mouse exchanges that covered every inch of the court.\nIn all, Alcaraz has played 960 minutes so far this tournament, which, when mixed with his late finishes, could be a factor against Frances Tiafoe in the semifinal. Here\u2019s a look at Alcaraz\u2019s journey: Alcaraz got a bit of a break in the first round against Sebastian Baez, the Argentine ranked No. 37, on a particularly hot and humid day at the tournament. After Alcaraz took the first two sets, 7-5, 7-5, Baez was forced to retire in the third set, down two games to none, with an injury. After the match, Alcaraz said in a news conference that the conditions were \u201creally tough.\u201d \u201cThe heat was pretty tough, so I\u2019m just really happy with the level and be able to play the second round,\u201d he said. Alcaraz cruised through the first two sets of his second round match against Federico Coria, an Argentine ranked No. 78. In the third set, Alcaraz had to battle. Tied at 4-4, Alcaraz and Coria dueled out a 16-point game, which Alcaraz ultimately won. Alcaraz sealed the win swiftly in two hours and 10 minutes. Alcaraz had another quick match in the third round, beating Jenson Brooksby, an American ranked No. 43, in two hours and 11 minutes.\nOpen picks, be sure to check out the latest tennis predictions from SportsLine's Sean Calvert.\u00a0 Calvert is the famed handicapper who called Stan Wawrinka winning the 2014 Australian Open at 60-1 -- the last Australian title won by someone other than Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer.

Sarandon will take the lead role as country music queen Dottie Roman.\nAdkins also said he didn't \"really lean on anybody\" for advice when it came to prepping for the role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has been on \"The Voice\" for years, and Tim recently starred in the \"Yellowstone\" prequel, \"1883.\" \"Blake\u2019s thing is a completely different animal,\" he said. \"You can\u2019t compare that stuff.\" He said he hadn't talked to McGraw, but added: \"Tim\u2019s a good actor, I\u2019ve always respected what he does. I\u2019ve just kind of done my own thing, haven\u2019t had to really lean on anybody too much for a lot of advice.\" Adkins, who isn't a stranger to acting, with previous stints on television and in the recent movies \"Old Henry,\" \"Apache Junction\" and \"Badland,\" said playing Albie, his character on \"Monarch,\" wasn't too big of a stretch. \"He's a no-nonsense kind of guy, and I\u2019m kind of that way too,\" Adkins admitted. \"He\u2019s not very animated, and neither am I. We say what we\u2019ve gotta say, and don\u2019t have to yell it \u2026 just kind of move through this life as softly and peacefully as they\u2019ll allow us to, but when they don\u2019t \u2013 we'll do what we\u2019ve gotta do.\nAdkins has even more acting experience; he said he's drawn to film and TV for the same reason he enjoys recording music. \"When I'm in the studio, it's just such a creative environment that stimulates me, and I just absolutely love it,\" he said. \"Television sets and movie sets are the same way. Everybody is so talented in that environment. I love the creativity, and I like being a part of it.\"   But even with his experience, he admitted, he was initially \"terrified\" to share scenes with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon.   \"And then,\" he said, \"I quickly realized, oh my God, she's so professional and so good that she's gonna carry the scene. So, if you don't throw up on yourself, you'll probably be OK because she's gonna do all the heavy lifting. I just swam in her wake the whole time and had a ball.\"   Monarch premieres on the Fox network at 8 p.m. EDT/7 p.m. CDT on Sept. 11.\nQuestion:What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?\nAnswer:"

Released in September 2022, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are Apple's current flagship iPhones, sold alongside the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. Now is not the best time to buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Plus because new iPhone 15 models will come out in September 2023. Those who prefer to buy at release will want to hold out until the newest models come out later this year.  If you just need an updated phone, don't want to wait, and aren't bothered by not having the latest bells and whistles, the iPhone 14 is an iPhone that will last for many years to come. For many people, the best time to buy is when you need a new device. The iPhone 14 is Apple's smaller iPhone at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 14 Plus offers the same feature set in a 6.7-inch form factor.  We'd encourage anyone looking for the newest technology and the highest-end phone to check out the iPhone 14 Pro or wait for the next-generation iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone 14 offers a good balance between functionality, longevity, and price, but if cost is the major factor for you, Apple also offers the $429 iPhone SE with older technology and the prior-generation iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini with pricing starting at $599.\nThe iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022, and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was\u00a0...\nList of iPhone models  The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth and latest generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15\u00a0cm) and 6.7-inch (17\u00a0cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[10][11] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[12] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[7][13] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[14]  The iPhone 14 does not have a \"Mini\" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, Apple has reintroduced a larger dimension iPhone 14 named the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple has not introduced a Plus model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017.\nPre-orders begin Friday, September 9, with availability for iPhone 14 beginning Friday, September 16, and availability for iPhone 14 Plus beginning Friday, October 7. \u201cOur customers rely on their iPhone every day, and iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus introduce groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. With the new, larger 6.7-inch display on iPhone 14 Plus, users can enjoy more content onscreen when browsing the web and even more text,\u201d said Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cBoth phones have a powerful new Main camera with a huge leap in low-light performance, advanced connectivity capabilities with 5G and eSIM, and the incredible performance of A15 Bionic, which helps enable even better battery life. All of this, tightly integrated with iOS 16, makes iPhone more essential than ever.\u201d \u00a0 A Beautiful and Durable Design with Amazing Battery Life Available in the popular 6.1-inch size and a stunning new 6.7-inch size,2 iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable and sleek aerospace-grade aluminum design in five beautiful finishes. The larger display of iPhone 14 Plus is great for streaming movies and playing games, and iPhone 14 Plus boasts the best battery life ever in an iPhone.\nApple would retain the iPhone 13 design, keep the notch, and even offer the same processor in its next device. Very little was shared about what would actually change in the base models, just that Apple would abandon the mini size for a \"Max\" or \"Plus\" with a 6.7-inch display. Ultimately, Apple leaned on camera improvements, satellite communications, and crash detection as new tentpole features. Big changes are expected for \"iPhone 15\" too, namely adding a USB-C port, but only time will tell. Both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in blue, purple, midnight, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED. Storage can be configured to 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB.

But \u201cSusie Searches\u201d isn\u2019t taking off as hoped, unlike the meditation site hosted by campus hunk Jesse (Alex Wolff). When Jesse suddenly goes missing, Susie seizes the opportunity to solve the mystery and make \u201cSusie Searches\u201d a hit. Cute and colorful, SUSIE SEARCHES is a \u201cgirl detective\u201d mystery story in the Nancy Drew mode \u2013 until it isn\u2019t. Actor-turned-director Sophie Kargman turns this sunny tale in a wholly unexpected direction. As Susie, Kiersey Clemons is impressive, as the title character finds her way through the plot\u2019s twists. In her feature film directorial debut, Kargman takes the script she co-wrote with William Day Frank and the idea of their short film, and transforms it into a tale you don\u2019t see coming, until it is right upon you.\nWhen fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she\u2019s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she\u2019s flooded with fans and fame.\u00a0 There\u2019s an element of the \u201csearch\u201d as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie\u2019s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She\u2019s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez\u00a0composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist\u2019s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn\u2019t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes\u00a0Susie Searches much more, and\u00a0 Clemon\u2019s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.\u00a0 Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie\u2019s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.\nFILM DETAILS: Title: Susie Searches Director: Sophie Kargman Release Date: July 28, 2023 Running Time: 105 minutes Language:  English Screenwriter: Sophie Kargman Distribution Company: Vertical Entertainment AWFJ Movie of the Week Panel Members: Sandie Angulo Chen, Betsy Bozdech, Jamie Broadnax, Leslie Combemale, Nikki Fowler, Pam Grady, Loren King, Cate Marquis, Jennifer Merin, Nell Minow, Sherin Nicole, Liz Whittemore  Previous #MOTW Selections Other Movies Opening This Week Edited by Jennifer Merin Jennifer Merin  is the Film Critic for Womens eNews and contributes the CINEMA CITIZEN blog for and is managing editor for Women on Film, the online magazine of the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, of which she is President.

So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a \u201cgood\u201d person by pushing her into corners that demand \u201cbad\u201d decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There\u2019s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis\u2014morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

Presented initially as a kind of takeoff on the burgeoning true-crime corner of the media marketplace, what emerges in Sophie Kargman\u2019s debut feature is something else entirely, at once a meditation on our era\u2019s obsession with fame and a psychological portrait of a lonely young woman determined to escape the narrow contours of her life by any means necessary. Clemons is terrific in embodying Susie\u2019s many contradictions, her sunny awkward demeanor covering dark ambition.

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and \u201cstressful\u201d regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics \u2014 that one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That \u201csomething\u201d outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch\u2019s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had \u201cmore than one\u201d team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. \u201cIt weighs on you every time, every day of the week,\u201d Busch said at NASCAR\u2019s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.\n36  Editor\u2019s Note: This story is included in The Athletic\u2019s Best of 2022. View the full list.  Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he\u2019d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team\u2019s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars\u2019 eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.\nBusch joins a two-car RCR team that has Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick under contract for next season. RCR will presumably expand to three cars to accommodate Busch\u2019s arrival, though the team could negotiate a buyout of Reddick\u2019s contract that has one year remaining after Reddick announced earlier this year that he\u2019s leaving to join 23XI Racing in 2024.

And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in 2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy to RCR, it will be Busch.\nBusch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. \u2013 announced in December 2021 \u2013 that it would end its NASCAR sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch\u2019s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come \u201cclose\u201d on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch\u2019s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch\u2019s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.\nQuestion:Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?\nAnswer:"

The 2022 season-ending ATP Rankings has finally been ratified following the conclusion of the ATP Challenger Tour and it is a Spain 1-2 at the top with Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal sitting pretty at the top. Alcaraz, who started the year at No 32, finishes as world No 1 on the back of winning his maiden Grand Slam, the US Open, as well as two ATP Masters 1000 events and two ATP 500 tournaments. The Spaniard won the joint-most titles (5) along with Novak Djokovic this year. 1. Carlos Alcaraz Spain 6,820 points 2. Rafael Nadal Spain 6,020 3. Casper Ruud Norway 5,820 4.

Joining Alcaraz, Auger-Aliassime and Fritz in the 2022 year-end Top 10 are 23-year-old Casper Ruud of Norway, 24-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece and 25-year-olds Andrey Rublev and Hubert Hurkacz. 2022 Year-End Pepperstone ATP Rankings Top 10 1) Carlos Alcaraz \u2013 Second Spanish year-end No. 1, joining five-time year-end No. 1 Rafael Nadal 2) Rafael Nadal \u2013 Ends year at No. 2 for eighth time and in Top 2 for record 13th time 3) Casper Ruud \u2013 Best year-end ranking for a Scandinavian player since No.\n7, but that\u2019s all because of Wimbledon. He\u2019s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It\u2019s not apples to apples like other years.\u201d Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP\u2019s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic\u2019s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) \u201cMost of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,\u201d Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. \u201cHe missed two majors and didn\u2019t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.\u201d The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid.

                "value": "The fourth season of the HBO Max superhero series Titans will bring in Bosch star Titus Welliver as iconic DC villain Lex Luthor. Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman\u2019s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor\u2019s arrival since season two when Conner/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character\u2019s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer\u2019s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).  Related: Future of Doom Patrol & Titans Uncertain Amid DCEU Shake-Up Titus Welliver is best known for his starring role in Amazon\u2019s acclaimed police procedural, Bosch.\nSuperhero stories are so common in movies and TV now that you can't expect every actor involved in such a production to be a lifelong fan of the material, but sometimes you get lucky. Titans showrunner Greg Walker previously told EW that when he reached out to actor Titus Welliver about portraying iconic DC supervillain Lex Luthor in season 4, he was surprised to find that Welliver was already well-versed in the comic book history of the Teen Titans.\u00a0 \"I've been collecting comic books since I was 7 or 8 years old,\" Welliver tells EW. \"I'm 60 now, so that's a lot of comic books.\"\u00a0 He has the nerd knowledge to prove it, too. Check out EW's conversation with Welliver about Luthor and all things Titans below.\u00a0 ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What first got you interested in the Teen Titans?\u00a0 TITUS WELLIVER: I love the period in the late '60s and the '70s when they're less clean-cut, their hair is longer, they're kind of hip, they're go-go dancing. I had always read the comics. I mean, I have all the omnibuses, plus I still have all of my original collection.\u00a0 So when somebody calls you up on the phone and says, \"Do you want to play Lex Luthor?\" The immediate answer is yes.\nRelated: Stargirl star teases Titans crossover episode Actor Welliver called his small appearance \"bittersweet\", though praised the storyline as \"so well realized that it wasn\u2019t one of those things where I stepped away from it and went, \u2018Man, there was so much that I could do, that we could do.'\" He continued: \"Anybody who knows that world, and knows Lex Luthor, knows that the guy\u2019s got probably clones stashed in his basement! We know that from reading the comics. We\u2019ve thought that Lex Luthor has been killed and, \u2018Oh, no \u2014 that was a clone.'\" The star added that the storyline \"was to really propel Connor/Superboy\u2019s story into the forefront of things, and give the fans of the show something to really bite into, to have a sense of where that character is going.\" Titans sirs on HBO Max in the US.

Welliver also happens to be a huge comic book fan and didn\u2019t take much convincing to join Titans, showrunner Greg Walker said. \"You usually have to do this whole dog-and-pony show to get an actor to do the show. But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most unexpected call I've ever had.\" As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor\u2019s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.\nQuestion:Who was playing Lex Luthor in Titans?\nAnswer:"

Upon the close of the acquisition, Mandiant will join Google Cloud. For the past 18 years, Mandiant has delivered unparalleled frontline expertise and industry-leading threat intelligence. Mandiant\u2019s more than 600 consultants currently respond to thousands of security breaches each year. Paired with research from more than 300 intelligence analysts, these resulting insights are what power Mandiant\u2019s dynamic cyber defense solutions \u2013 delivered through the managed multi-vendor XDR platform, Mandiant Advantage. Google Cloud has made security the cornerstone of its commitment to customers and users around the world \u2013 building cloud-native security into the foundation of its technology to block malware, phishing attempts and potential cyber attacks at scale.\u00a0The Mandiant acquisition underscores Google Cloud\u2019s commitment to advancing its security offerings to better protect and advise customers across their on-premise and cloud environments.\u00a0 The acquisition will complement Google Cloud\u2019s existing strengths in security.

He added: \"We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help customers address their most important security challenges.\" The deal is expected to close later this year.

FireEye was credited with helping\u00a0Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack\u00a0that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, \"With cyber attacks increasing by the day and cyber warfare underway from Russia/state sponsored cyber terrorism organizations, Google is doubling down on its cyber security footprint at the right time with Mandiant and looking to differentiate itself from the likes of behemoths Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud arms race.\nGoogle Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization,\u201d said Kevin Mandia, CEO, Mandiant. \u201cTogether, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio.

The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks \u2014 down 10.6% from their peak \u2014 costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.  President Joe Biden adopted a more optimistic view, saying, \"Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two months. That is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do.  \"Gas prices are down an average of $1.\nThe annual inflation rate for the United States was 3.0% for the 12 months ended June, according to U.S. Labor Department data published on July 12, 2023. This follows a rise of 4.0% in the previous period. The next update on inflation is scheduled for release on Aug. 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET. It will provide information on the rate of inflation for the 12 months ended July 2023. Below is a chart and table displaying annual US inflation rates for calendar years from 2000 and 2013 to 2023.

Meanwhile, the \"Ave\" column shows the average inflation rate for each year using CPI data. In 2022, the average inflation rate was 8.0%.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an 8.1% annual increase. Prices increased 8.5% in July.  Excluding volatile food and gas prices, inflation climbed 6.3%\u00a0year-on-year \u2014 higher than the consensus estimate for 6.1% and an increase from last month's 5.9% reading.  The energy index rose 23.8% over the past 12 months. That includes the cost of electricity, which saw its largest one-year increase (15.8%) in four decades, according to the data.  Other categories that saw increases in August include motor vehicle maintenance and repair, up 1.7%; health insurance, up 2.4%; and pets and pet products, up 1.6% in the 30-day period between July and August.

I thought Walter Cronkite and the news were so boring. But my dad insisted it was important to know what was going on in the world. My dad had no idea how he was preparing me. Night after night, Walter Cronkite came into the living room reporting the news, and people trusted that he was giving them the truth. My dad was one of those people.

Hocus Pocus 2 is only weeks away and we've been given a spooky treat of a new trailer for the eagerly-awaited sequel. The second trailer was debuted at the D23 Expo and it gave us our first look at Hannah Waddingham's role as The Witch, as well as the return of Doug Jones as \"good zombie\" Billy Butcherson. Disney released the first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel in late June and if you weren't aware of the demand for the movie, the trailer notched up more than 40 million views in its first 24 hours. The sequel sees the Sanderson Sisters return to wreak havoc in Salem once again, but what else can we expect? Here's everything you need to know about Hocus Pocus 2. As mentioned above, the first trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 arrived on June 28, 2022 and while it was low on plot, it was high on spookiness. The trailer teased the return of the Sanderson Sisters and featured other classic Hocus Pocus items such as the Black Flame Candle.  Disney then revealed the second trailer for Hocus Pocus 2 on September 9, 2022 and it was more plot-focused than the teaser.\nDoug Jones will also be returning as Billy Butcherson alongside with a number of new cast members, including Hannah Waddingham, Tony Hale, Sam Richardson, Juju Brener, Froy Gutierrez, Taylor Paige Henderson, and Nina Kitchen.          \u201cHocus Pocus 2\u201d is being directed by Anne Fletcher (\u201cThe Proposal,\u201d \u201c27 Dresses\u201d), who took over the directing responsibilities from her friend and colleague Adam Shankman (\u201cHairspray,\u201d \u201cThe Wedding Planner\u201d), with Lynn Harris (\u201cThe Shallows\u201d) serving as producer. Shankman is currently in production on \u201cDisenchanted\u201d for the studio, which he is directing, but has has remained on this project as an executive producer along with Ralph Winter (\u201cAdrift\u201d) and David Kirschner (\u201cCurse of Chucky\u201d). Steven Haft (\u201cTigerland\u201d) is co-producer. Are you looking forward to \u201cHocus Pocus 2\u201d arriving on Disney+ this Halloween season? I cannot wait for HP2 \u2026 and delighted that the original Sanderson sister will be back. \r I loved the first HP completely spell bounded me. So I was one that wanted HP2 to go ahead .

You can watch the original \"Hocus Pocus\" movie on Disney Plus. You can also rent the movie for $4 from retailers like Amazon Prime Video and Vudu. In \"Hocus Pocus,\" the Sanderson sisters are summoned and resurrected by a teenage boy on Halloween night. With the help of a magical cat, the teenager and his sister must steal the sisters' book of spells before they can use it to become immortal.

Photos:Lil Nas X brings stunning fashion and spectacular dance to ACL Fest It is far too early to start speculating about next year's lineup, but we will note that C3 Presents, the company behind the festival, has announced the lineup for next year's Latin American Lollapaloozas. The events, which take place in Argentina, Chile and Brazil in March, will be headlined by Drake, Billie Eilish, Blink-182, Tame Impala, Rosal\u00eda and Lil Nas X. Billie and Nas just headlined the fest and the Blink-sters are playing the Moody Center next July. But Drake, Tame Impala and Rosal\u00eda all seem like solid bets for next year's lineup.\nKendrick Lamar: Playing 5 tracked festivals this year (Bonnaroo, Lolla Chicago, Gov Ball, Osheaga, Outside Lands) plus Life Is Beautiful in late September, which has a small history of crossover with ACL.     Leon Bridges: Playing 2 tracked festivals this year (BottleRock, Jazz Fest). Also headlining Format Festival, a C3-produced fest in Arkansas a week before ACL that has some crossover last year.     Lil Yatchy: Playing 3 tracked festivals this year (Osheaga, Outside Lands, Okeechobee). Alluded in an IG post after SXSW that he'd \"be back soon austin, I promise\".     Lizzo: Of the three female acts who had massive subheadlining sets in 2019, she is the only one who has not returned to close a stage (after Billie Eilish & Kacey Musgraves). Headlining major festivals this year with ACL overlap. Playing 3 tracked festivals this year (BottleRock, Jazz Fest, Gov Ball).     Maggie Rogers: Tour skips Texas and ends the weekend before ACL at a small festival in Maryland.

It's almost 10pm eastern and it's extremely unlikely anything new will drop before tomorrow morning. Thanks for playing along! I'll see you nerds next year.   Last update: May 8th @ 10:00pm EST       And\u2026WE\u2019RE BACK!!! I am now on year SEVEN of doing this speculation thread and I'm proud to keep this train rolling. This will be our subreddit's ongoing hub of all things rumors, predictions, who\u2019s in/who\u2019s out, etc until we get the lineup.         Quick notes on my process:         I am assuming acts that play in Central Texas before May to be in play. There is precedence (albeit a limited one) for acts to play in May and still make it on the bill but 99% of the time, if they play May or later, they are out for ACL.         I will not include any acts that played ACL in the past two years. While I know there are some very limited cases of artists playing twice in a three-year span, it would be overkill to track over 300+ acts when 99% of them are out. Only in very obvious cases will I track a '21 or '22 act.\nQuestion:When is ACL 2023 taking place?\nAnswer:"

It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, but you cannot change authors and subject areas. As this is the first time the main conference is using OpenReview as platform, which requires to create an account prior to submission, we will exceptionally allow modifications to the list of authors between the abstract deadline and the paper submission deadline. No further changes to the author list will be allowed after the paper submission deadline. Submissions with \u201cplaceholder\u201d abstracts will be removed without consideration; Important: if you miss the abstract submission deadline, then you cannot submit the full paper. EMNLP 2023 has the goal of a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order): Submission is electronic, using the OpenReview conference management system. Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.\nPapers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized. Reviewers will be asked to assess the reproducibility of the work as part of their reviews. The following are the criteria that reviews will take under consideration. For all reported experimental results: For all experiments with hyperparameter search: For all datasets used: This list is based on Dodge et al, 2019 and Joelle Pineau\u2019s reproducibility checklist.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2023 by the early registration deadline. More information can be found in the Committee blog. If you have questions that are not answered there, please email the program co-chairs at emnlp-2023-pc@googlegroups.\nPapers submitted directly to EMNLP will have the \u201cregular\u201d review process: paper reviewed by 3 reviewers, authors are invited to write an author response and revise their paper before the camera ready deadline, if accepted. ARR papers committed to EMNLP will be handled by the Senior Area Chairs. For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required \u201climitations\u201d section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below). This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications. We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process. Papers that are in the ARR system after May 27, 2023, either submitted after or submitted before and not withdrawn, cannot be submitted to EMNLP 2023. Major differences from \u201cstandard\u201d recent conferences include: All deadlines are 11:59 pm UTC -12h (\u201canywhere on Earth\u201d).\nQuestion:Where is EMNLP 2023 taking place?\nAnswer:"

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19\u00a0September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nThe Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George\u00a0VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government \u00a3162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.\nBritain honored the life of Queen Elizabeth II with a state funeral steeped in tradition on Monday. The Queen, the UK's longest-reigning monarch, died September 8 after a rule spanning seven decades. She was 96. The funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey in London, where the Queen was crowned 69 years ago and where she was married to her husband, Prince Philip, 75 years ago. Presidents, prime ministers, princes, an emperor and an empress were among the dignitaries paying their final respects \u2014 a testament to the Queen's far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy. Thousands of people flocked to the Abbey and streets along the 25-mile (40-kilometer) procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Queen's flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place in St. George's Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.

The Funeral Service and the associated ceremonial arrangements paid\u00a0tribute to The Queen\u2019s extraordinary reign, and Her Majesty\u2019s remarkable life of service as Head of State, Nation and Commonwealth. The Funeral was\u00a0broadcast live on TV, radio and The Royal Family's Youtube Channel to allow people around the world to take part in mourning The Queen. The Queen's Coffin had been Lying-in-State since the evening of Wednesday 14th September. At 6.30am on the morning of Monday 19th September, the Lying-in-State ended.      At 1044hrs the Coffin was\u00a0borne in Procession on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey for the State Funeral. Immediately following the Coffin was\u00a0The King, Members of the Royal Family and members of The King\u2019s Household.         \u00a0 The State Funeral Service was\u00a0conducted by the Dean of Westminster and The Sermon and the Commendation were given by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Royal family members and dignitaries gathered at Westminster Abbey for a somber service. Presidents, prime ministers, princes and princesses, and other public figures sat side-by-side to pay their last respects \u2013 a testament to her far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy.            The funeral, which served as both a state and religious service and marked the culmination of 10 days of mourning, honored the Queen with the sort of pageantry that she used to promote the royal family and \u201cbrand Britain\u201d throughout her life.           Tens of thousands of people flocked to streets around Westminster Abbey and along the 25-mile procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the sovereign\u2019s flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place.           In the third and last procession of the day, the Queen\u2019s coffin was taken past throngs of well-wishers lining the Long Walk to Windsor Castle for her committal service and burial at St. George\u2019s Chapel, where she was separated from the crown for the final time.

Following the Queen\u2019s death, her oak coffin \u2013 draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers \u2013 sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen\u2019s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.\nThe PBS NewsHour aired a special report on Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s life, legacy, and her influence within the royal family, across the United Kingdom, and around the world.

The PBS NewsHour takes a look back at the queen\u2019s life and her historic role. Here\u2019s what we know about the days and weeks to come. Buckingham Palace has long planned out a series of procedures to carry out in the days and months after the event of Elizabeth\u2019s death. As The Guardian reported in 2017, the queen\u2019s funeral is expected to take place 10 days after her death, allowing for a period of national mourning. The state funeral for Elizabeth will take place on Monday, Sept. 19 at Westminster Abbey in London, the Associated Press reports.

A single-engine Cessna 172 and another aircraft \u201ccollided and crashed\u201d near Vance Brand Airport in Longmon just before 9 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Longmont is located about a half hour from Boulder.           There were two people onboard the Cessna 172, according to the FAA. The number of people onboard the second aircraft, identified by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as a Sonex Xenos, is not confirmed at this time, the FAA said.            Both passengers in the Cessna 172 died on the scene, the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. There was one confirmed occupant in the other aircraft, who was also reported deceased upon the arrival of first responders, the sheriff\u2019s office said.           When first responders arrived on the scene, they discovered two separate crash sites, according to the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office.           The first aircraft was found on the south side of Niwot Road, while the second aircraft was found on the north side.           Authorities have not yet identified the three people who died in the crash, police said.            The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash.    \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.\nSeveral 911 callers reported seeing two planes collide over Boulder County. Three people are confirmed dead after two small aircraft collided mid-air in Colorado Saturday, authorities said. Multiple 911 callers reported seeing two planes collide over Boulder County shortly before 9 a.m. local time, the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said. The aircraft collided and crashed near Vance Brand Airport in Longmont at 8:50 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The collision involved a single-engine Cessna 172 and a Sonex Xenos aircraft, a type of motor glider, the National Transportation Safety Board said. First responders found two separate crash sites near Niwot Road, the sheriff's office said. Aerial footage showed that one of the aircraft had landed in trees, while the other crashed into a nearby field. Two people were on board the Cessna 172, the FAA said. The sheriff's office also said it confirmed two people were on board the plane, both of whom were found dead at the scene. The sheriff's office said at this time one person was confirmed to be in the aircraft, who was also found dead at the scene. The FAA said it is unknown how many people were on board the second aircraft. The victims have yet to be identified, the sheriff's office said. Once identified, their names will be released pending next-of-kin notification. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash.\n9NEWS Aviation Safety Analyst Greg Feith said that whenever there is a midair collision, there's a multifaceted investigation.\u00a0 \"You have to look again, first and foremost at each aircraft for any kind of mechanical malfunction, failure or anomalies that would cause or contributed to the accident,\" he said, adding that the other factor includes looking at the avionics of each plane, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).\u00a0 \"That uses transponder information and the transponder basically pings a signal from the airplane. It's picked up by air traffic control radar so that your plane can be identified by the number, altitude and ground speed. But the technology also lets airplanes communicate among each other. So now the same ping goes off between point or one airplane to the other,\" Feith explained.\u00a0 Besides that system, Feith believes this is more of a \"see and avoid\" type accident.\u00a0 \"That is on a beautiful day like this, it is incumbent upon each pilot flying in the airspace to clear the area visually to ensure that things like this don't happen,\" he said.\u00a0 Feith adds that the airspace around where this crash may have happened, is known to have high air traffic, especially since it's known as a \"training box.\" \"So you have a lot of airplanes operating in a band of airspace or a box of airspace.\nAnd if there are pilots that are training but transient aircraft coming through that area, of course, it's incumbent upon all pilots to make a number of radio calls in the blind so that you can alert other pilots who may be in the near vicinity to where you are, what you're doing, what altitude you're operating at.,\" Feith explained.\u00a0 While it's still unclear what exactly led up to this crash, Feith notes that the recent pilot shortage has generally increased the number of people going to flight schools. \"Right now, because pilot training has escalated ten-fold because of the pilot shortage in the airlines,\" he said.\u00a0 In any case, Feith says there will also be environmental factors to be looked at too.\u00a0 \"So they're going to be looking at sun angles - were the pilots flying in to - in a direction that may have given them sun glare so they really couldn't see,\" he said. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash. NTSB said that a preliminary report will be released in about 15 days. The full investigation, however, can take more than a year. Niwot Road between Highway 287 and 95th Street was closed while Mountain View Fire Rescue and BCSO investigated the crash. The public was asked to stay away from the area.\nA preliminary assessment of the aircraft showed that neither aircraft was equipped with a collision avoidance system or any kind of display in the cockpit to alert the pilot to other aircraft in the area. They were not required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to have those capabilities, Folkerts explained. Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video     Seeing and hearing planes flying overhead along Niwot Road isn't out of the ordinary for local residents. > Video above: Sky9 footage showing the first downed plane. \"Not uncommon to see lots of small planes especially on a weekend morning,\" said Cary Hayes, who heard the planes crash Saturday morning. \"We do get a decent amount of air traffic around here.\" \"Not used to hearing that pop though,\" said Hayes. \"That was a little unusual.\"\u00a0 He was sitting in his living room around 9 a.m. Saturday when he heard the plane crash.\u00a0 \"It's hard to believe on a beautiful sunny day like today that they could hit each other, but it happens,\" said Hayes. \u00a0 Neighbors in the area gathered outside to see what happened.\u00a0 \"I've never heard a plane crash before, but we both said to each other, 'That was a plane crash,'\" said Cindy Wolcott. \"It was just, I don\u2019t know, instinctually felt that that was the case.\u201d She was inside, too, when she heard the crash.\nQuestion:How many people died in the mid-air collision in Boulder County?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Populist firebrand Giorgia Meloni has been named as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.           She received the mandate to form a government from Italy\u2019s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month\u2019s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy\u2019s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy\u2019s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini\u2019s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.\nThe ceremony took place after a week of tensions within Meloni\u2019s coalition after partner Berlusconi boasted about his ties with Russian President Putin. Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy\u2019s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners\u2019 stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act \u201cin the exclusive interests of the nation\u201d \u2013 a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners \u2013 hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia\u2019s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia\u2019s Antonio Tajani is now the country\u2019s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League\u2019s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members. Another key department, the defence ministry, is going to Brothers of Italy\u2019s co-founder and close adviser to Meloni Guido Crosetto \u2013 a defence industry expert who was head of the Federation of Italian Aerospace Companies.\nThe possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.\n30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]\nHe succeeded in being elected by obtaining 116 votes out of 206 in the first round thanks to the support from opposition parties to the centre-right coalition.[117][118][119] Tensions further grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as \"patronising, overbearing, arrogant ... [and] offensive\" in a series of written notes in the Senate.[120][121] In the following days, after meetings between parties' leader, tensions loosened and the centre-right coalition parties reached an agreement on the formation of the new cabinet.[122]  On 20 October, consultations between President Sergio Mattarella and parties officially began. On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy\u2013Us Moderates\u2013MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]\nQuestion:Who is Italy's first female prime minister?\nAnswer:"

Uncapped James, 18, has played for England Under-20s and was last week included in the Wales Under-21 squad. Senior Wales boss Robert Page has now promoted James to his squad. While a hamstring strain ruled out Allen, defender Ben Davies' small leg fracture forced his absence. Swansea's Allen and Tottenham's Davies picked up the injuries with their clubs. Davies, 29, is expected to be out for around three weeks after suffering his injury in Spurs' Champions League defeat by Sporting Lisbon. Allen came off in Swansea's 3-0 Championship win over Hull on Saturday. Wales travel to Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland three days later. Spurs manager Antonio Conte has said Davies will not be available for Wales duty. \"He had an injury in his knee in the game against Sporting Lisbon, and he played with this injury,\" Conte told Sky Sports.  \"It is not a serious injury, I think (he will be back) after the international break because, with the national team, he is not available.  \"But I think after the international break, he will be available for us.\" Allen, 32, missed the start of the season with a hamstring problem picked up on Wales duty in June.\nRyan Giggs, the Wales manager, has challenged his team to prove their strength in depth by winning in the Republic of Ireland without Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Giggs explained that Bale will miss the match because of \u201ca bit of fatigue\u201d but will probably be fit enough to play for Real Madrid on Saturday. Ramsey, meanwhile, is unavailable after becoming the father of twins on Sunday. Wales will also be without the injured teenager Ethan Ampadu, who controlled midfield when Wales thrashed Ireland 4-1 in Cardiff last month. Victory in Dublin would take Wales above Denmark to the top of their Nations League group while defeat would put them bottom. Wales have won only three competitive matches without Bale since he made his international debut in 2006. \u201cWe have to cope, prove people wrong, make that record better,\u201d said Giggs. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy but we\u2019ve still got players who can make things happen.\u201d Ben Davies, the left-back, struck a similar note. \u201cThese are the games where we have to adapt and show what we\u2019re about. We\u2019ve got a lot of young quality coming through and we\u2019ve got to show what we can do.\u201d The absences could lead to a start for Harry Wilson, a 21-year-old on loan at Derby County from Liverpool.\nBut he has quickly established himself as one of Swansea's key players having returned to the club after leaving Stoke City at the end of last season. Davies' absence and the loss of Allen are further blows to Wales manager Page, who is already planning to be without forward Gareth Bale to face Belgium. Wales are also without injured midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson, plus goalkeeper Adam Davies. Wales' World Cup campaign begins against the USA on 21 November. James has made 10 appearances for Birmingham this season and has previously represented Wales at Under 18 level. Born in Hereford, he qualifies for Wales via his father, former Newport County defender Tony. who also played for Hereford. Wales sit bottom of League A Group 4 with one draw from four games, with results not helped by Page having to field largely second-string sides in two of those games as he prepared for what would turn out to be a historic World Cup play-off victory over Ukraine. But that leaves Wales needing at least one win from these two fixtures if they are to remain in the top tier of the Nations League.

Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nGiggs also revealed Dummett could have been in line for a place in his starting line-up against Azerbaijan, had he made himself available for selection. \"He just wants to concentrate on club football. I've got to respect that and I have players in that position who are playing so I'm not fussed about that.

The finals featured the first-seeded Las Vegas Aces facing off against the third-seeded Connecticut Sun.[1] The Aces defeated the Sun in 4 games, winning their first WNBA Championship. This was Las Vegas's third time making the finals, and the second time since moving to Vegas. They previously competed in the Finals in 2008 and 2020. This was Connecticut's fourth time making the finals. They previously competed in 2004, 2005, and 2019.[2]  The Aces won the finals three games to one to claim their first championship in franchise history.  Head coach Becky Hammon became the first rookie head coach to win the WNBA Title.  In the WNBA's Inaugural Finals, Van Chancellor was a rookie to the WNBA, but had coached in college for nineteen years before winning the WNBA title.[3] Alyssa Thomas recorded the first WNBA Finals triple-double in Game Three.[4] She recorded the second in Finals history in Game Four.[5]  Bold Series winner In November 2021, the WNBA Board of Governors formalized a new playoff system that will structure the 2022 playoffs onward.\nThe conclusion of the 2022 WNBA All-Star Game can only mean one thing: the playoffs are approaching.\u00a0 Unlike previous seasons, the 2022 WNBA Playoffs will have a new format. The top eight teams with the best overall record will compete in the postseason, regardless of conference. The first round, which matches teams based on highest-to-lowest seeding, will be a best-of-three series. After that, the semifinals and finals will be a best-of-five affair, so there will be no single-elimination games this year. As the stakes increase these next few weeks, here are the odds for which WNBA team is favored to win the championship in 2022, with odds provided by our betting partner, PointsBet: After an upset win in 2021, the Chicago Sky are not favored to repeat this year. Here\u2019s the full 12-team order: Las Vegas Aces: +150 Chicago Sky: +225  Seattle Storm: +400 Connecticut Sun: +425 Washington Mystics: +1100 New York Liberty: +5000 Dallas Wings: +10000 Phoenix Mercury: +10000 Minnesota Lynx: +15000 Atlanta Dream: +15000 Los Angeles Sparks: +15000 Indiana Fever: +25000 Editor's note: All odds are provided by our partner, PointsBet.\nThey were lead by A'ja Wilson who scored twenty six points and had ten rebounds to record her second double-double of the Finals.  Chelsea Gray added twenty one points and Kelsey Plum scored twenty points.  The Sun had four players score in double digits, and were lead by Courtney Williams who scored eighteen points.  Jonquel Jones recorded a double-double with sixteen points and eleven rebounds.  Alyssa Thomas scored thirteen points and Brionna Jones added twelve points from the bench.  Connecticut came out strong on their home court in the first quarter of Game Three and won the quarter 34\u201319.  Las Vegas made a slight recovery and won the second quarter 23\u201319, which left Connecticut's lead at eleven points heading into half time.  Las Vegas won quarter three 27\u201324 to cut the lead to eight points.  However, Connecticut dominated the fourth quarter 28\u20137 and won Game Three by twenty-nine points.  The Sun had six players score in double digits and were lead by Alyssa Thomas.  Thomas scored a triple-double with sixteen points, fifteen rebounds, and eleven assists.  It was Thomas' third triple-double of the season and the first triple-double scored in the WNBA Finals.[8] Jonquel Jones lead the team in scoring with twenty points.  DeWanna Bonner added eighteen points, Natisha Hiedeman scored fourteen, DiJonai Carrington scored twelve points from the bench, and Courtney Williams added eleven.\nThe team that executes the best when the game is on the line and the players that can knock down shots when the pressure is at its peak could determine the outcome of this series. THE PICK Chicago in five games. These teams have played one another eight times in the past 11 months and Chicago has gone 7-1 in those games. That is a hard fact to ignore when considering which team will be the first to earn three wins over the next 12 days. Of course, by picking the Sky, I\u2019ve added more disrespect fuel to the Sun\u2019s collective competitive fire. As a team, Connecticut plays with a chip on it shoulder with a desire to quiet doubters on their way to success. They have a prime chance to do so in this series as they look to knock off the defending champs on their way back to the Finals.

Let awards season begin!\u00a0 NBC will be hosting the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards in 2023. The network has been hosting the award ceremony since 1996, which recognizes the best and brightest in film and television, as selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.  \u201cWe recognize the HFPA\u2019s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th anniversary in January 2023,\u201d Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming\u2019s Chairman of Entertainment Networks, said in a statement.\u00a0 Here's what to know about the\u00a02023 Golden Globes: Tuesday, January 10, 2023.\nStepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.  The show was pushed out of the mainstream awards cycle last year after a Los Angeles Times investigation uncovered questionable self-dealing, ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among members of its parent organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.   Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d \u201cFabelmans,\u201d \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d and \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin.\u201d   The 80th Golden Globe Awards \u2014 which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season \u2014 will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network\u2019s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes\u2019 return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show\u2019s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them \u2014 and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios \u2014 including Netflix and WarnerMedia \u2014 cut ties after The Times\u2019 investigation.\nBy clicking Sign Up, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and that you have read our Privacy Policy.

The Golden Globes returned to NBC after the 2022 broadcast was pulled amid controversy. The 2023 awards show was held at the Beverly Hilton in California on Tuesday, January 10, hosted by comedian Jerrod Carmichael. Nominations were revealed in December 2022, three months after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) confirmed that the Golden Globes would air on TV once again for its milestone 80th ceremony. \u201cWe are thrilled to announce the return of the Golden Globe Awards on NBC and to hosting the \u2018Party of the Year\u2019 for audiences around the world who have been waiting for its return,\u201d HFPA president Helen Hoehne noted in a September 2022 statement, calling the awards a \u201cmust-see\u201d event. \u201cThe HFPA remains committed to important changes and supporting programs which prioritize diversity, inclusion, and transparency. See you on January 10!\u201d Trophies were handed out to the best and brightest stars of film and TV in January 2022, but the celebration wasn\u2019t televised.\nPlanning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization\u2019s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions\u2019s CEO Jay Penske said: \u201cAs stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.\u201d The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix\u2019s \u00a0YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a\u00a0Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of \u201cself-dealing\u201d and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of\u00a0Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like\u00a0I May Destroy You were snubbed.\nAnd more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to \u201ceradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.\u201d Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group\u2019s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year\u2019s list of presenters \u2014 which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino \u2014 many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren\u2019t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal\u2019s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special \u201cRothaniel,\u201d in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022.\nQuestion:When did the Golden Globe Awards 2023 take place?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "The Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\n17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\n27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294\u00a0mAh battery and 2\u00a0GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\nSimply reading \u201cPixel Watch 2\u201d in an official-looking font, it\u2019s unclear if it was taken from an internal Google source, or is simply a mock-up. The tweet was posted on the 9th of May, potentially hinting at an I/O reveal (the keynote took place the next day) but one never came. Let\u2019s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn\u2019t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it\u2019ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it\u2019s a safe bet that Google will follow suit. That means we can expect the Pixel Watch 2 to arrive in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, barring any delays.  Pricing is more of an unknown. You could pick up a Pixel Watch for \u00a3339/$350 at launch, but prices quickly dropped and now you can get one for \u00a3300/$300 with a bit of shopping around. Would a successor land at a more modest price to drum up interest? And while Google managed to match the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro\u2018s prices to their predecessors, the Pixel 7a arrived with a \u00a350/$50 increase over the outgoing Pixel 6a.\nYou can read our full Pixel Watch review for all of our in-depth analysis, but the overall takeaway is that we were left with an expectation that Google is just getting started. We fully expect to see a Pixel Watch 2 in the not-to-distant future. For starters, the lineup stands out among Wear OS-based wearables with a streamlined, Google-centric user experience and unique Fitbit integration. As such, it\u2019s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit\u2019s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features. Respected leaker Evan Blass tweeted an image containing the words \u201cPixel Watch 2\u201d on May 9. It\u2019s unclear if this image was derived from an official source.

The 67-year-old Abe, who was Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions, officials said. A hearse carrying Abe\u2019s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his home in Tokyo. Abe\u2019s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan\u2019s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was obviously homemade \u2014 about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long \u2014 and they confiscated similar weapons and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.\nOn 8 July 2022 around 11:30 JST,[299][300] Abe was shot while delivering a campaign speech at Yamato-Saidaiji Station, Nara.[301][302][2] He was supporting fellow LDP party member Kei Sat\u014d for the House of Councillors election.[303]  The assassin approached Abe from behind and fired two shots using a homemade firearm. The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the chest. He was fatally struck in the heart.[304][305][306][307]  Abe was rushed to the Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara by helicopter. Prior to his arrival at the hospital, Abe had already shown no vital signs. Despite a transfusion of 100 units of blood (\u2248\u202f30 litres),[308] the blood loss was too great and attempts to resuscitate Abe failed;[309][310] he was pronounced dead at 17:03 JST.[303][311]  He was 67 years old.[2]  A 41-year-old man named Tetsuya Yamagami, a former JMSDF member, was immediately arrested and later confessed to local police.[312][313] Yamagami stated that he held a grudge against the Unification Church[314][315][316] and shot Abe because \"the religious group and Abe were connected\".\n82][3][83] At 2:45\u00a0pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55\u00a0pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03\u00a0pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55\u00a0a.m. on 9 July.\n[307][317][318] Yamagami said he resented the fact that his mother was brain-washed by the religious group, and had gone bankrupt as a result.[319][320] Yamagami had been trying to kill Hak Ja Han of the Unification Church since around 2002, but he gave up because he could not get close to her, changing his target to Abe.[321] Yamagami said that he \"didn't have a grudge against Abe's political beliefs\", but instead that he killed Abe because he believed the former prime minister had spread the religion to Japan.[319][320] Abe and his family were known to have long-standing ties to the Unification Church, dating back to his grandfather Kishi Nobusuke; Abe himself had held speeches in support of the religious movement.[322][323] According to research by Nikkan Gendai, 10 out of 20 members in the Fourth Abe Cabinet had connections to the Unification Church.[324]  In response to the shooting and his subsequent death, numerous present and former world leaders expressed their sympathies and support for Abe.[325][326] His body was returned to Tokyo the day after his assassination and his funeral took place on 27 September 2022.[327][328]  Some have described Abe as a right-wing Japanese nationalist.\nQuestion:when did Shinzo Abe die?\nAnswer:"

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech on July 8 outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. Yamagami then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation prosecutors said showed he's fit to stand trial.   Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them he killed Abe, one of Japan's most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe's apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.  One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to former leader Abe, saying he \u201cwas a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.\u201d           Kishida said he had a \u201cgreat respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind\u201d and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.

US President Joe Biden said he was \u201cstunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,\u201d adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was \u201ca tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.\u201d            \u201cWhile there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,\u201d the US president said in a statement.            Later on Friday, Biden ordered American flags at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until Sunday in recognition of Abe\u2019s death.      Who was former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe?\n66][70][71] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area.[72][73][74] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed. Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist.[75][76] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout. This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot.[77]  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 11:37\u00a0am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41\u00a0am.[78] Six out of the twenty-four emergency responders at the scene later showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Nara City Fire Department.[78]  Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot.[79] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious.[80] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding under his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot.[81] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival.\n82][3][83] At 2:45\u00a0pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55\u00a0pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03\u00a0pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55\u00a0a.m. on 9 July.\nQuestion:who killed Shinzo Abe?\nAnswer:"

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) \u2014 A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation\u2019s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party\u2019s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party\u2019s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan\u2019s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.\n(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, Pool) /// Color guards carry the remains of former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe during the state funeral Tuesday Sept. 27, 2022, at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo.

TOKYO \u2014 Japan held a rare state funeral for its longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Tuesday, despite widespread public opposition to the event. Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun. The government estimates that 23,000 mourners lined up to lay flowers at tables in front of pictures of Abe outside the hall. In a sign of the divisions surrounding the commemoration, thousands of others took to the streets in protest. Just down the street from the Budokan, protesters opposed to the state funeral tussled with Abe supporters and police.  Critics objected to the use of $11.\n(Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP)                                                           TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japan\u2019s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan\u2019s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan\u2019s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor \u2014 which was made without parliamentary debate or approval \u2014 as well as the funeral\u2019s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe\u2019s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe\u2019s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.\nQuestion:when was the State funeral of Shinzo Abe?The state funeral of Shinzo Abe, former prime minister of Japan and serving member of the House of Representatives who was assassinated on 8 July 2022, was attended by roughly 3,600 people within Japan alone and by around 700 international attendees.[1] The funeral was held on 27 September 2022 at the Nippon Budokan venue in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Out of the foreign attendees, 49 top-level foreign leaders and 218 foreign delegates, including 101 ambassadors and representatives based in Japan, were present at the state funeral.[2]\nAnswer:"

                "value": "The teaser also features the queen and the princess\u2019 latest spat, with tempers flaring so much that Alicent publicly pulls a knife on Rhaenyra. Now that the pivotal sixth episode has made its way to air, we\u2019re officially in the back stretch of the season. House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon\u2019s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, \u201cDriftmark,\u201d which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who\u2019ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter\u2019s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark. As we\u2019ve seen in the trailer, viewers will see the funeral for Laena.\nHouse of the Dragon. Photograph by Ollie Upton / HBO We\u2019ve rounded the halfway point on\u00a0House of the Dragon\u00a0season 1, HBO\u2019s much-hyped\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0prequel series. House of the Dragon\u00a0will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes. In addition,\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u2018\u00a0series page for the show has episode titles listed. We\u2019re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u00a0episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6. While the episode titles aren\u2019t confirmed by HBO, it\u2019s still enough to get us pretty excited. \u201cThe Lord of the Tides\u201d refers to the head of House Velaryon; why will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season? Then there\u2019s \u201cThe Green Council.\nDen of Geek    Ad New actors, new dragons, and new drama keep House of the Dragon fresh after a 10-year time jump. This House of the Dragon review contains spoilers. \u201cThe Princess and the Queen\u201d is effectively a second pilot episode for House of the Dragon. The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that\u2019s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon\u2019s respective broods of children.\u00a0 The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you\u2019re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn\u2019t work. And yet, work \u201cThe Princess and The Queen\u201d does. This episode isn\u2019t just an impressive technical maneuver. It\u2019s by far the most entertaining and enriching dispatch from House of the Dragon yet.\u00a0 The fresh burst of energy that \u201cThe Princess and The Queen\u201d provides to House of the Dragon is evident from its very first scene.\nAlso, don't get in their way, because this is one couple that'll stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) began as Rhaenyra's protector, then killed her husband's lover at her wedding, and now he may be on the side of Queen Alicent, who talked him out of killing himself in the Godswood at the end of episode 5. He's seen fighting Ser Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr), aka Harwin Breakbones, noted for his strength. If Ser Harwin is now Rhaenyra's protector, this could be essentially an Alicent-Rhaenyra proxy fight right here. Stay tuned. Episode 6 of House of the Dragon will air on Sept. 25 on HBO Max.\nSara Hess,                                                                                                                                     Charmaine De Grate   Paddy Considine King Viserys Targaryen Actor Matt Smith Prince Daemon Targaryen Actor Olivia Cooke Alicent Hightower Actor Emma D'Arcy Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen Actor Fabien Frankel Ser Criston Cole Actor Rhys Ifans Otto Hightower Actor Graham McTavish Ser Harrold Westerling Actor Matthew Needham Larys Strong Actor Jefferson Hall Tyland Lannister Actor Gavin Spokes Lord Lyonel Strong Actor Bill Paterson Lord Lyman Beesbury Actor Ryan Corr Ser Harwin \"Breakbones\" Strong Actor George R.R.

Season three, which already premiered in April 2022 in the UK, is set to have its international premiere on the streamer in October. Netflix confirmed the news, writing on Twitter Aug. 31, \"It's going to be so hard to say goodbye...The final season of our beloved Derry Girls arrives October 7 on Netflix (outside The UK & Ireland).\" This has us just about ready to blast The Cranberries and wallow in our rooms. However, the ending of the Derry Girls doesn't come as a surprise to fans, as the show's creator Lisa McGee announced the show's final season back in September. \"It was always the plan to say goodbye after three series,\" the screenwriter explained at the time. She later called Derry Girls \"a love letter to the place I come from and the people who shaped me.\" Derry Girls stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Louisa Harland and Dylan Llewellyn as a group of Irish teens growing up in Northern Ireland in the \u201890s. Coughlan is now one of the stars of Bridgerton, and is set to step into the leading lady spot for season three.\nBy  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Fletcher   Updated: 4 May 2022, 10.54am | 6 min read  By Press Association Updated: 4 May 2022, 10.54am | 6 min read  Derry Girls is the ultimate comedy for children of the 90s. With its razor-sharp script, schooldays nostalgia and genius characters, it\u2019s certainly a series to binge. After the first two seasons were a huge success, find out everything we know so far about the show's return in 2022 for season 3, including the release date, cast, trailer and more. Watch the latest shows and sport from Sky with a NOW Membership, Netflix, and Discovery+ all in one place. Derry Girls season 3 starts on Tuesday, April 12th, 2022 on Channel 4. Catch up on All 4. New episodes are released weekly. Season 3 releases new episodes every Tuesday at 9.15pm on Channel 4. The final season will have six episodes. The Derry Girls season 3 finale will air on Tuesday 17 May at 9.15pm on Channel 4. It's been confirmed that a special one-off episode will will air in the same week as the finale, although Channel 4 hasn't announced a specific release date for it yet.\nAt the moment, an official Netflix release date for Derry Girls Season 3 has not been confirmed, but judging by previous release patterns, Derry Girls could hopefully be heading to Netflix in the summer. In the past, Derry Girls has landed on the global streaming platform after all episodes of Derry Girls have finished airing on Channel 4 and All4. This means Derry Girls could land in June 2022 at the earliest or at some point this summer. Fingers crossed it will not be too long a wait. Derry Girls will be sticking to its roots in the third and final Season 3, which means, yes, more drama and mischief from Erin, her cousin Orla and their friends Clare, Michelle, and English James as they come of age during the Troubles in Derry while juggling school at Our Lady Immaculate College., romance, relationships and the chaos of the 1990s. Season 3 will see the gang waiting for their exam results but, as teased in the trailer, fans can expect to see a lot of the usual mess the Derry Girls find themselves in. The official synopsis per Channel 4 teases: \"While Northern Ireland is growing up, this gang of eejits certainly aren't any time soon - there's hope in the air that The Troubles may finally be over, but their troubles are only just getting started as they get ever closer to 'adulthood'.\nIt's been over three years since fans of the hilarious sitcom Derry Girls saw Erin (played by Saoirse-Monica Jackson), Orla (Louisa Harland), Clare (Nicola Coughlan), Michelle (Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), and James (Dylan Llewellyn) get up to some serious mischief. Thankfully, Derry Girls Season 3 is almost here. However, the long-anticipated wait for Season 3 is bittersweet as the latest series marks the end of the Derry Girls story. Lucky fans in the U.K. and Ireland will have access to the new series before the rest of the world, with the third and final season premiering on Tuesday, April 12 at 9.15 p.m. on Channel 4 and episodes airing every Tuesday thereafter. So, when exactly will Season 3 of Derry Girls land on Netflix? Newsweek has everything you need to know. Just like the first two seasons of Derry Girls, Season 3 will be coming to Netflix for fans to enjoy. Unfortunately, fans in the U.S. will be waiting a little longer for the final season to drop. The good news is, unlike viewers in the U.K., who will have to wait for every Tuesday at 9.15 p.m. for episodes to drop, all six episodes will be available in one go for fans to binge-watch.\nAfter proudly declaring himself a \u201cDerry Girl\u201d and bringing everyone to tears (it\u2019s OK if you cried too), he decided to remain in Derry with his friends. Good news for everyone, because the trailer picks up right where we last left them. If their past mishaps tell us anything about the final season, it\u2019s that no one\u2019s going without an emotional and hilarious bang.\u00a0 Derry Girls Season 3 starts streaming Oct. 7. Check out some photos below. Clare Devlin (Nicola Coughlan) is having a plaid moment.\nQuestion:When is the premiere date of Derry Girls Season 3?\nAnswer:"

The Nobel Prize is not a single prize, but five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, are awarded \"to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\". Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace.  The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, 10 December. As of 2022, 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 226 laureates, 214 men and 12 women. The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist, Emil von Behring, for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose, important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes. The most recent Nobel prize was announced by the Karolinska Institute on 3 October 2022, and has been awarded to Swedish Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, for the discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution.\nSubsequently, those selecting the recipients have exercised wide latitude in determining what falls under the umbrella of Physiology or Medicine. The awarding of the prize in 1973 to Nikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch for their observations of animal behavioural patterns could be considered a prize in the behavioural sciences rather than medicine or physiology.[14] Tinbergen expressed surprise in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at \"the unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award this year's prize 'for Physiology or Medicine' to three men who had until recently been regarded as 'mere animal watchers'\".[44]  Laureates have been awarded the Nobel Prize in a wide range of fields that relate to physiology or medicine. As of 2010[update], eight Prizes have been awarded for contributions in the field of signal transduction through G proteins and second messengers. 13 have been awarded for contributions in the field of neurobiology[45] and 13 have been awarded for contributions in Intermediary metabolism.[46] The 100 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 195 individuals through 2009.[47][48]  Twelve women have received the prize: Gerty Cori (1947), Rosalyn Yalow (1977), Barbara McClintock (1983), Rita Levi-Montalcini (1986), Gertrude B.\nHarvey Cushing, a pioneering American neurosurgeon who identified Cushing's syndrome, was not awarded the prize, nor was Sigmund Freud, as his psychoanalysis lacks hypotheses that can be experimentally confirmed.[18] The public expected Jonas Salk or Albert Sabin to receive the prize for their development of the polio vaccines, but instead the award went to John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins whose basic discovery that the polio virus could reproduce in monkey cells in laboratory preparations made the vaccines possible.[19]  Through the 1930s, there were frequent prize laureates in classical physiology, but after that, the field began fragmenting into specialities. The last classical physiology laureates were John Eccles, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley in 1963 for their findings regarding \"unitary electrical events in the central and peripheral nervous system.\"[20]  A Medicine or Physiology Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[21] These are awarded during the prize ceremony at the Stockholm Concert Hall.  The Physiology and Medicine medal has a portrait of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse.[22] The medal was designed by Erik Lindberg.[22] The reverse of the medal depicts the 'Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl's thirst'.\n9] The following medical experts were the members of the 2022 Nobel Committee:   The following publications were the fundamental researches that motivated the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet to award the 2022 Prize to P\u00e4\u00e4bo:[10]\nQuestion:Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine?\nAnswer:"

The appointment of Collier as Fox\u2019s entertainment chief executive officer surprised the industry \u2014 even some internal Fox staffers, who had expected to see Gary Newman oversee the network\u2019s transition into a standalone entity once 21st Century Fox\u2019s merger with The Walt Disney Company was complete. Newman has been atop the Fox network as Fox TV Group chairman with Dana Walden since 2014, and has run 20th Century Fox TV with Walden since 1999. The exec had been a part of 21st Century Fox and its predecessor News Corp. for more than two decades, but he\u2019ll now depart by the end of the year when the merger is completed.                Even before Friday\u2019s announcement, Newman\u2019s nearly 20-year partnership with Walden was set to finish by the end of December, as Walden has been named chairman of Disney TV Studios and ABC Entertainment. Newman had been in talks to stick around at New Fox and guide the network\u2019s transition as staffers adjusted to being a part of a smaller company without a studio sibling.\nPrevious gigs also include serving as EP on \u201cThe X Factor\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d as well as head of TV at Syco Entertainment North America.  \tIn taking the key Fox Entertainment chairman job, Wade follows in the footsteps of other alternative execs who have ultimately run a network, including former NBC Entertainment chairman Paul Telegdy (who coincidentally also hails from the UK, like Wade).  \tWade\u2019s appointment to the top Fox gig comes as Collier exited the network last month to join Roku Media as president. There, Collier will now oversee advertising sales and content for Roku\u2019s owned-and-operated channels featured on the streaming platform that hosts the fast-growing number of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels as well as serving as a key funnel for Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+ and other subscription streamers.  \tHere\u2019s a memo Wade sent to staffers on Thursday:  Dear Team,It is truly humbling and a great honor to be the new CEO of Fox Entertainment.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from P\u00e9rez in third, which demoted him to third behind P\u00e9rez. The win meant that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading P\u00e9rez by 113 points, with 112 points still available.\nSee Japanese Grand Prix picks at SportsLineMax Verstappen -190Charles Leclerc 15-4Lewis Hamilton 10-1Sergio Perez 11-1George Russell 14-1Carlos Sainz 18-1Lando Norris 150-1Fernando Alonso 200-1Daniel Ricciardo 400-1Esteban Ocon 400-1Pierre Gasly 500-1Sebastian Vettel 750-1Lance Stroll 750-1Yuki Tsunoda 1000-1Valtteri Bottas 1500-1Kevin Magnussen 1500-1Mick Schumacher 2000-1Alexander Albon 2000-1Guanyu Zhou 2000-1Nicholas Latifi 2500-1 \u00a9 2004-2023 CBS Interactive.

As a child, Shahi was interested in sports and participated in beauty pageants. She majored in English and Theater at the Southern Methodist University in New Mexico. Sarah Shahi met legendary American director Robert Altman early in her career and worked on his film, Dr. T & the Women. She subsequently went on to star in Dawson's Creek, Supernatural, Alias, and The L Word. In 2007, she played a minor role in HBO's iconic gangster series, The Sopranos. That same year, she landed her first lead role on television in Facing Kate, aka Fairly Legal.\nSarah Shahi has seemingly confirmed the long-running rumor that she will play Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam. After all these years, Black Adam is now finally ready to begin filming, and star Sarah Shahi, whose role has remained relatively mysterious, may have now revealed who she is playing. Shahi recently took to social media to celebrate the start of filming on the DC outing, referring to her character as \"Adrianna,\" and thus likely confirming and ongoing rumor that she will, in fact, be playing Adrianna Tomaz. \"Today is my first day filming #blackadam. I was cast in this role a year ago. I've had ups, downs, lefts, and rights. They all led me here. Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna. Let's continue to lift each other up as we tell each other's stories. Human stories. Connecting stories. Stories we all have inside of us.\" Adrianna Tomaz was originally spun out of the 1970s TV series The Secrets of Isis, which aired alongside the original Shazam! television show. The character was later folded into DC lore, becoming known as the wife of Black Adam. A refugee who is delivered to Black Adam as a gift, the supervillain quickly develops a deep respect for Adrianna, eventually gifting her with the magical amulet of Isis, which imbues her with powers over the forces of nature.\nRelated:\u00a0Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on\u00a0Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of\u00a0Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for\u00a0Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how\u00a0Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.\nWhile specific plot details for Black Adam are currently unknown, Shahi's Adrianna Tomaz will join a host of heroes and villains which are all being introduced for the first time to the silver screen. Along with Adrianna, the movie will also feature the big screen debut of Justice Society of America, or JSA. The iconic superhero team will no doubt clash with Johnson's superpowered champion, with the Justice Society of America set to be made up of Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate. Shahi's role in proceedings was not the only Black Adam mystery, with Marwan Kenzari, Bodhi Sabongui, and James Cusati-Moyer all cast in currently unknown roles. Black Adam finally going into production marks another achievement for Dwayne Johnson, with the actor and Hollywood superstar having been signed on to play the role for over a decade. \"Black Adam has been with me for over ten years now. That gives you an idea of how passionate I am about this project,\" Johnson said last year of his commitment to the project. \"How passionate our Seven Bucks is about this project. Warner Bros., New Line Cinemas, DC, they have been so incredibly supportive over the years,\" Johnson continued. \"In 2008 was when we first started talking about this. So, it has required patience by all of us as partners.\nShe also does not go by \u201cIsis,\u201d because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we\u2019ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven\u2019t seen the movie, so I can\u2019t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she\u2019s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the \u201970s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she\u2019s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.\nQuestion:who played Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "By \t\t\t \t\t\tBlair Marnell\t\t  The new\u00a0Quantum Leap reboot has found its leading man. Deadline is reporting that Raymond Lee has been cast in the leading role in the new Quantum Leap pilot. Lee will portray Dr. Ben Seong, the \u201cspiritual successor\u201d of Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), the original time traveler on the series. Within the reboot/revival series, Seong is described as both \u201ca world-renowned physicist\u201d and also \u201ca man of faith.\u201d The potential show takes place 30 years after Sam disappeared into the time travel machine he created: the Quantum Leap accelerator. Seong will initially be a member of the new team, before eventually using the accelerator to go back to the past. According to to the report, \u201d Ben Seong gets stuck in the late 1980s with amnesia.\u201d But there\u2019s no mention about whether someone on his team can communicate with him in the form of a hologram, like the late Dean Stockwell\u2019s Al. Lee\u2019s previous credits include Scandal, Made of Love, Prodigal Son, Mozart in the Jungle, and Here and Now. He is also a series regular on AMC\u2019s\u00a0Kevin Can F*** Himself. Bakula has had negotiations to take part in the new series, but he is currently not attached to it. La Brea\u2018s Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt are writing and executive producing the new Quantum Leap pilot.\nRaymond Lee, who will appear in Top Gun: Maverick, is cast in the lead role of Ben Seong in NBC's highly-anticipated Quantum Leap reboot pilot. The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick\u00a0actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently\u00a0leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother,\u00a0will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.\nAiding him throughout his leaps is Addison (Caitlin Bassett), who appears in the form of a hologram only Ben can see and hear. A decorated Army veteran who brings level-headed precision to her job, Ben will need her as he leaps from person to person. At the helm of the highly confidential operation is Herbert \u201cMagic\u201d Williams (Ernie Hudson), a no-nonsense career military man who has to answer to his bosses, who won\u2019t be happy once they learn about the breach of protocol. The rest of the team at headquarters includes Ian Wright (Mason Alexander Park), who runs the Artificial Intelligence unit \u201cZiggy,\u201d and Jenn Chou (Nanrisa Lee), who heads up digital security for the project. As Ben leaps from life to life, putting right what once went wrong, it becomes clear that he and the team are on a thrilling journey. However, Addison, Magic, Ian and Jenn know that if they are going to solve the mystery of Ben\u2019s leap and bring him home, they must act fast or lose him forever.  Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett and Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci, the original Quantum Leap ran for five seasons between 1989 and 1993.\nMartin Gero, Deborah Pratt, and Quantum Leap creator Don Bellisario are also executive producing the revival. The Quantum Leap revival will at least have a pilot episode before NBC makes decision about whether to order a new series. Are you looking forward to seeing Lee in the new Quantum Leap?

La Brea vets Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt are co-showrunners and executive producers.

Where to Buy\r The GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs will be available as custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, Galaxy, GIGABYTE, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PNY and Zotac. The RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (16GB) are also produced directly by NVIDIA in limited Founders Editions for fans wanting the NVIDIA in-house design. Look for the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs in gaming systems built by Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and MSI, leading system builders worldwide, and many more. About NVIDIA\r Since its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry. More information at\u00a0https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/.\nSearching for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 to buy? Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got your covered, by searching through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia\u2019s shining star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping performance metrics, it\u2019s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090 is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the 4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.\nThe RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn\u2019t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you\u2019ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC\u2019d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you\u2019re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS. However, months after launch, prices for board partner GPUs are beginning to ease toward MSRP. Despite this, it\u2019s still priced lower than we initially expected, as a Vietnamese retailer listed the new GPU for over $2000. However, it\u2019s thankfully lower.\nThe RTX 4090 also possesses a higher MSRP than the RTX 3090, which was launched at $1499. This bump of $100 is actually fairly good pricing, considering inflation in the subsequent years, too.  It\u2019s tough to tell what demand might look like for the RTX 4090, but since it will retain Nvidia\u2019s power crown, and will potentially be one of the best graphics cards in 2023. The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.  Due to an oversupply, Nvidia has cut the price of current-generation high-end graphics cards, and the newer RTX 40-series GPUs are priced slightly higher.  The RTX 4090 manages to boast incredibly impressive specifications on paper, with even more impressive results in gaming scenarios like in Overwatch 2. We\u2019ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You\u2019ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia\u2019s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM. Nvidia released further information on performance that you can expect out of Overwatch 2 using the GPU, we\u2019ve listed their results below.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we\u2019ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It\u2019s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.\nQuestion:What is the price of RTX 4090 GPU?\nAnswer:"

So, with all that in mind, here is exactly how you can watch Sweetwater when it finally arrives on our screens. Related:10 Best Sports Movies For People Who Don't Like Sports Movies After an immensely long production period, with the film first set as \"in production\" back in 2012, the release date of this film will feel like the culmination of a saga. Recently, it was announced that Briarcliff Entertainment would release the film nationwide in theaters on April 14, 2023. So, after so long, anyone who has been following this movie's progress can finally book their tickets. Currently, there is no announced streaming release for Sweetwater, however, with sports biopics all the rage, and with Netflix in particular really getting into the genre, it is likely that, soon, the film will end up available to stream somewhere before long.\nOf course, as well as this, there is likely to be a DVD release of the movie, which is also worth keeping an eye out for. Yes, there is a trailer for Sweetwater, and it can be watched below: The themes of the film are striking throughout the trailer, with the opening line \"It ain't about the color of my skin\" resonating instantly. The dramatic score and intense dialogue set up a feeling of triumph through adversity, and it looks as if Sweetwater may just be one of the most feel-good movies hitting theaters this Spring. Every good biopic has a strong and often inspiring central character, and Sweetwater is no different. Born in Arkansas in October 1922, Nat Clifton, nicknamed \"Sweetwater\" because of his love for fizzy drinks, showed his true talent for basketball throughout his time in school. After serving in the US Army during World War II, Clifton made it back safely and began his career in professional basketball. As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd. In 2014, some 24 years after his death, Clifton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, perfectly summarizing his incredible career.\nTelling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner.  Sports biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of Sweetwater reads: \"The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.\nPrincipal photography was set take place in the San Francisco Bay area and New York City that summer.[9] The Great Recession caused a delay production and by April 2009 filming was expected to start in Winnipeg.[10] Two Lagoons and Astra Blue Media were then attached to co-produce, along with additional cast members of Mira Sorvino, Kevin Pollak, James Caan and Smokey Robinson.[10]  By July 2014, some cast members had been replaced.[11] Wood Harris replaced Simmons as Nat Clifton, Nathan Lane would play Saperstein and James Caan as Ned Irish.[12] Brian Dennehy, Patrick Warburton and Ludacris were all attached to star in undisclosed roles.

First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\n65] Nicole Nguyen of The Wall Street Journal did not find the smartwatch particularly astounding and noted several software bugs, but ultimately deemed it a worthy companion to the Pixel phone.[66]  Analyst firm Canalys calculated that Google shipped an estimated 880,000 Pixel Watches during the fourth quarter of 2022, constituting 22\u00a0percent of Google's total wearable sales, which include Fitbit products. The Pixel Watch's launch allowed Google to obtain 8\u00a0percent of the wearable market share, jumping 16\u00a0percent from fourth place to second place, behind Apple.[67] The Pixel Watch Android app had amassed more than 500,000 downloads by February 2023.[68]  In May 2023, it was reported that Google was aiming to launch a second-generation Pixel Watch later that year, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.[69]\n27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294\u00a0mAh battery and 2\u00a0GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\n17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\nTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

Julian Chokkattu nearly a decade after Google launched its Android Wear smartwatch platform\u2014now called Wear\u2014a Google-made watch is finally here. It's called the Pixel Watch. The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.\u00a0 There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8. Speaking of Apple, these Pixel Watches lack any sort of iPhone compatibility. Google's taking a page from Apple and limiting the Pixel Watch for use with Android phones only.

The award will be presented at the Foundation\u2019s annual Heroes & History Makers celebration, on October 19 at The Anthem in Washington, DC and streamed live. The event is the Foundation\u2019s annual tribute to America\u2019s 5.5 million military caregivers, the loved ones who voluntarily care for wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans at home. Senator Elizabeth Dole will be joined by Hidden Heroes Campaign Chair Tom Hanks and multi-platinum, global entertainer Chris Young. The Caregiver Champion Award was named for Tom Hanks in recognition of his outstanding support of military caregivers. The award has previously been presented to former First Lady Michelle Obama; music superstar Tim McGraw; and actor and humanitarian Gary Sinise. Guthrie was selected in recognition of her devoted advocacy of those who serve and their families. Since joining the Foundation as a Hidden Heroes Ambassador in 2018, Guthrie has used her national platform to bring awareness to the 5.5 million loved ones caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member at home. \u201cWe are thrilled to honor our champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,\u201d said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.\nWe should make her work at night as well.\u201d Hanks later highlighted Savannah's efforts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to inform struggling caregivers about the resources that were available to them. \u201cPerhaps, where her commitment shines the most, is during the many, many, many personal conversations she shares with caregivers out of view of the cameras and I\u2019ve seen that happen dozens of times,\u201d Hanks noted. \u201cWith incredible grace and earnest spirit, she assures them that they will not endure their journey alone.\u201d While accepting her award, Savannah shined a light on the real stars of the night \u2014 the military caregivers who Savannah called a depiction of \u201ccourage, determination, duty, faith and hope.\u201d \u201cEvery person here tonight, every caregiver and veteran at home, you are showing the world what love looks like, what love acts like, what love gives and what love sacrifices,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is love of country that calls our service-members to duty. And it is love that propels mothers and fathers, spouses, siblings, children \u2014 to hold them and care for them when they return, with wounds seen, and unseen.\u201d Savannah called out by name specific caregivers she's encountered, like Colleen Rose, who nursed her husband through devastating burn injuries, and Pat Ochan, who cares for her husband and raises their son all while juggling her job and pursuing a Ph.D.\nHollywood   by senior contributor Brendan Kownacki \u201cIf there is a best way in order to combat [that] trauma and that ongoing desperation, it is community,\u201d said actor and advocate Tom Hanks about the challenges felt by military caregivers and family members as they help their loved ones with both big tasks and small tasks alike, facing the new reality of being service disabled. \u201cIt is being a part of something bigger than one\u2019s self. And Hidden Heroes started doing it 10 years ago, and it is the key operative motor.\u201d  Tom Hanks Hanks is best known as an actor and director, creating feel-good masterpieces like Big, Toy Story, and That Thing You Do, but also for creating historical epics that chart the stories of our men and women at war, like Saving Private Ryan or the HBO series \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201d Maybe this fascination with the Greatest Generation is what led to his work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and supporting military caregivers as the chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign. Hanks has been candid in saying that it\u2019s way more simple, when Elizabeth Dole asks for your help, you don\u2019t say no.  Senator Elizabeth Dole \u201cYou can never fail when you follow the example of Elizabeth Dole\u201d said Steve Schwab, CEO of the foundation, summing up the resolve of the former Senator, Executive, and Cabinet Secretary who has left such an indelible mark on the United States.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to honor our champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,\u201d said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, in a news release. \u201cOver the past four years, she has become deeply invested in our cause. She has brought our caregivers\u2019 stories of service and sacrifice into millions of homes across America. And she has gone above and beyond, with such grace and compassion, to speak directly to military caregivers and ensure them that they are not alone.\u201d Dole was the first to call the nation\u2019s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers.\nQuestion:Who is the recipient of the 2022 Tom Hanks Caregiver Champion Award?\nAnswer:"

Monaco, whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most especially park users to help shape her vision for the park\u2019s future. Coming out of the pandemic and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization\u2019s capacity in order to keep pace with the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.\nFebruary 4, 2022 A message from Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue: I am writing to you today with exciting news: Mayor Eric Adams has announced my appointment as the next New York City Parks Commissioner.\u00a0 Serving as the President of Prospect Park Alliance and Park Administrator has been one of the great honors of my career. I\u2019ve been so lucky to work alongside so many dedicated people, from Alliance and NYC Parks staff, to our incredibly hardworking volunteers and community advocates, and a devoted Board of Directors that has provided the Alliance exceptional guidance and leadership. I\u2019m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City\u2019s most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving, 35-years-young organization. During this time we\u2019ve advanced the park in numerous ways: rebounding from the challenges of the pandemic through our Re:New Prospect Park initiative; restoring the Flatbush Avenue perimeter and creating the first new entrances of the park since the 1940s; revitalizing and expanding the park\u2019s woodlands and natural areas; bringing back to the public the exquisitely restored Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion; and securing funds for our next great phase of restoration, the 26-acre Vale in the park\u2019s northeast corner.\nAdvertisement Supported by By Lisa W. Foderaro The Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit group that raises money for and oversees the daily operation of Brooklyn\u2019s most visited park, has appointed a former New York City parks official as its new president. Sue Donoghue, who oversaw Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s sustainability and parks blueprint known as PlaNYC, succeeds Emily Lloyd, who left to lead the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Donoghue lives a block from the park. \u201cWith three kids, the park is a big part of our daily existence,\u201d said Ms. Donoghue, whose appointment was approved by the alliance\u2019s board on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s our backyard and front yard.\u201d The Prospect Park Alliance, founded in 1987, was one of the first conservancies that set out to transform a long-neglected park. (The Central Park Conservancy began in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration projects. Last year, the park unveiled the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, a $74 million project that includes two skating rinks; the southeast corner of the park was also restored and redesigned. Like the leaders of several major park conservancies, Ms. Donoghue, 49, will serve as both the alliance\u2019s president and the park\u2019s official administrator for the parks department.\nUnder her leadership, I know Prospect Park will continue to expand access to green spaces for all New Yorkers, develop programs that bring our neighborhoods together, and do so in a way that leads our City into the Green future we all deserve. I am so excited to welcome Morgan into the role of President, and look forward to working closely with her to guarantee the Park continues to be a place all New Yorkers can enjoy.\u201d \u201cProspect Park is a gem in Brooklyn, and our communities deserve a leader to take the helm of Prospect Park Alliance with the passion and effort that the job requires,\u201d said Council Member Rita Joseph. \u201cMorgan Monaco delivers on those requirements and then some. I\u2019m so excited for her stewardship of our park and to collaborate with her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m excited that Morgan Monaco has been selected as new President of the Prospect Park Alliance,\u201d said Council Member Shekar Krishnan, Chair of the Council\u2019s Committee on Parks and Recreation. \u201cUnder the thoughtful stewardship of the Alliance, Prospect Park has become one of the crown jewels of New York City\u2019s Parks, serving so many diverse communities across Brooklyn. With her substantial experience at the helm of a non-profit as well as within the Parks Department, I\u2019m confident she will continue the Prospect Park Alliance\u2019s long-standing commitment to park equity and community engagement.

Video game developer and publisher Riot Games has announced its acquisition of Wargaming Sydney, a gaming software development studio that\u2019s part of Cyprus-based Wargaming, the publisher behind titles such as World of Tanks and World of Warships. Riot did not disclose the price of the purchase.  Wargaming Sydney is one of the largest games studios in Australia, formed under its original name of BigWorld back in 2002. It was by Wargaming in 2012. The studio has created game development tools and other software architecture required to develop online games such as MMOs. After the acquisition by Riot, Wargaming Sydney will be renamed Riot Sydney and will assist in the development of Riot games such as Valorant and League of Legends.\u00a0 Wargaming will maintain ownership of BigWorld Technology Wargaming Sydney is the only operation being acquired by Riot Games, with other studios under the Wargaming name unaffected by the purchase. Wargaming will also maintain ownership of BigWorld technology\u2019s gaming software architecture for its existing products. Riot says the newly branded Riot Sydney will be a key contributor to its network of development studios.\nRiot Games Singapore is to support Riot's existing titles and will have a major focus on developing the company's newer titles.[36] Jason Bunge was hired as Riot Games' chief marketing officer in October 2020.[37] In October 2021, the company bought Kanga, a services firm involved in \"fan hubs\", merchandising, and content aggregation.[38]  Riot Games collaborated with French animation studio Fortiche to release an animated series, Arcane. The series was released worldwide in November 2021 on Netflix, and by parent company Tencent in China, and received a favorable critical reception.[39][40] In March 2022, Riot Games announced that it had invested in Fortiche and, as a result, its chief content officer Brian Wright and director of corporate development Brendan Mulligan were joining Fortiche's board of directors.[41] That same month, Riot also hired executives from Netflix, Paramount, and HBO Max to head development of film, TV, and music endeavors built around the company's intellectual property.[42]  In October 2022, Riot acquired Wargaming Sydney\u2014a subsidiary of Cyprus-based Wargaming that had originally developed the MMO middleware BigWorld\u2014for an undisclosed amount, and renamed it Riot Sydney. The acquisition excludes rights to the BigWorld technology itself, as well as its publishing arm.[43]\nRiot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher, and esports tournament organizer based in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Riot Games' publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversees the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the League of Legends universe.  Riot Games operates 12 international League of Legends esports leagues, the League of Legends World Championship and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 20 offices worldwide as of 2023, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues. Riot has faced allegations and lawsuits claiming a toxic workplace culture, including gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The company was criticized for its use of forced arbitration in response to these allegations.  Riot Games' founders Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill became friends while roommates at the University of Southern California, where the two studied business.[3] Beck and Merrill believed too many video game developers diverted their focus from game to game too often, distinguishing Defense of the Ancients as an indication that games could be supported and monetized long-term.\nnote 1] The company also teased further games \u2014 Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra \u2013 that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips.[28][29] Project A was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020[30] and was officially released on June 2, 2020.[31]   In December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partners with smaller game development studios for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in development.[32] Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double Stallion Games.[33] Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.[34]  Riot acquired Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game.[35] Also in April, Riot announced plans to establish a Singapore office later that year.\n3] Following Riot Games' first world championship event in 2011, a small affair at a conference in Sweden, the company decided to turn their tournaments into professional sports-like events.[5] It invested in broadcasting equipment, hired sports programming producers, and trained pro gamers to be \"TV-ready\".[5] In 2012, Riot Games held its tournament at University of Southern California's Galen Center, offering $1\u00a0million in prize money.[5] Riot Games has since held tournaments in Berlin, Seoul, Madison Square Garden in New York City, and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.[5]  The company sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its esports league.[5] In 2015, investors bought stakes in teams and began building their own squads.[5] Among the team owners in Riot Games' leagues are the owners of the Washington Wizards, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers, AOL co-founder Steve Case, and life coach Tony Robbins.[5][56][57] Inc. cited the growth of the leagues and high-profile ownership as part of its reasoning for making Riot Games its 2016 Company of the Year.\nQuestion:What gaming software development studio did Riot Games acquire?\nAnswer:"

Like the start of any next chapter, this is a natural moment for transition. I've made the decision to take on a new role as a senior advisor to Apollo. This role will enable me to support our next phase of growth and continued investment in the company. As such, I am excited to welcome Jim Lanzone as the new CEO of Yahoo effective September 27, 2021. Jim is a veteran technology and media leader with two decades of leadership experience and a deep track record of growth, innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit. I have every confidence he will be a terrific leader for the new Yahoo. Jim and I will work together to ensure a seamless transition, and I'm confident he will build on our successes and lead us into our future. What an incredible journey this has been. I joined the company three years ago as part of Verizon. Today, we're a standalone company with significant potential to grow beyond what we have accomplished thus far. We have the best team, with the right products, content and technology to shape the future of Yahoo. To reiterate what's been said many times over the past few months \u2013 this next chapter is a testament to the great work you've delivered against a focused strategy.\n47][48] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced 2,000 layoffs,[49] or about 14% of its 14,100 workers by the end of year, expected to save around $375 million annually.[50] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.[51]  On May 13, 2012, Thompson was fired and was replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group. Several associates of Third Point Management, including Daniel S. Loeb were nominated to the board of directors.[52][51][53][54] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.[55]  On July 15, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective July 17, 2012.[56][57]  In June 2013, Yahoo acquired blogging site Tumblr for $1.1 billion in cash, with Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp continuing to run the site.[58][59][60][61] In July 2013, Yahoo announced plans to open an office in San Francisco.[62]  On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.[63]\nYahoo\u2019s CEO sees a consumer giant and possible spinoffs of some of the site\u2019s biggest brands Jim Lanzone has never been afraid of a solid turnaround story. Yet the former chief of Tinder, CBS Interactive, and Ask Jeeves views Yahoo as less of a company in need of revamping than one never been properly vetted for its upside. This is why Lanzone stepped into the CEO spot in 2021, taking over the nearly 30-year-old internet legend. \u201cI do think the brand has a huge strength,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the biggest opportunity for the brand is ahead with the work we can do here.\u201d Gone is the famous yodel that played on Yahoo\u2019s commercial in the early days of the internet. Left is a brand with what Lanzone calls a \u201cmodern vintage feel,\u201d and a fanbase rooting for its success. That\u2019s not going to be hard to find, with more revenue and profit than Twitter, and a platform used by one billion people every month, he says. What does that future look like? Lanzone sees multiple opportunities \u2014 even possible spinoffs of some of Yahoo\u2019s inside brands including Yahoo Finance and its email service, which he notes filters 28 percent of all global emails. Hear more from Lanzone about his plans for Yahoo in this month\u2019s Signal Conversation with Signal 360\u2019s John Battelle.

In 2008, the company laid off hundreds of people as it struggled from competition.[36]  In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion.[37][38] Yahoo rejected the bid, claiming that it \"substantially undervalues\" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Although Microsoft increased its bid to $47 billion, Yahoo insisted on another 10%+ increase to the offer and Microsoft cancelled the offer in May 2008.[39][40][41][42]  Carol Bartz, who had no previous experience in Internet advertising, replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009.[43][44] In September 2011, after failing to meet targets, she was fired by chairman Roy J.

Q3 was the first quarter of 2022 when Netflix didn\u2019t lose subs. According to Tuesday\u2019s shareholder letter, executives at Netflix believe they\u2019ll add 4.50 million subs globally in the final quarter of 2022. The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time represented 9.4 percent growth. So we\u2019re not there \u2014 but we are well above the company\u2019s tempered expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers in Q3. Clearly, it bested that \u2014 the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10 per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion. Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19, Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.\nThis key metric indicates the number of global users that have signed up and paid for a subscription to receive streaming services. Streaming subscriptions are a critical component of Netflix's revenue, and maintaining growth in this area is increasingly difficult with the entry of many competitors in the streaming space. Though this figure beat analyst estimates, it represents a slowdown in membership growth relative to the 9.4% YOY growth in paid memberships for Q3 FY 2021.   Netflix said that the rising U.S. dollar poses a significant headwind for its Q4 FY 2022 and is likely to contribute to $7.8 billion in revenue, a decline sequentially and and an increase YOY. It gave no guidance on EPS. The company also expects membership growth to slow relative to the prior quarter, with an expected 4.5 million paid net adds compared to 8.3 million for Q4 FY 2021. The company said it does not anticipate a material contribution from its advertising business in the upcoming quarter as it will launch midway through Q4 and will grow membership over time.   Netflix shares spiked by 15.1% as of 4:21 p.m. New York time. The stock has vastly underperformed the broader market over the last year, with a 1-year trailing total return of -62.3% against -17.1% for the S&P 500.\nBy   \tTodd Spangler  NY Digital Editor  \tAfter two straight quarters of subscriber losses, Netflix returned to growth in the third quarter of 2022 \u2014 and told investors it\u2019s expecting a strong Q4 to finish the year, even though it doesn\u2019t expect big gains right away from the launch of its cheaper, ad-supported plans.  \tThe streaming giant reported 2.41 million net new paid subscribers in Q3, including a gain of 100,000 in the U.S./Canada region, to stand at 223.1 million worldwide as of the end of September. That handily topped Netflix\u2019s previous forecast of a 1 million pickup for the period.  \tFor Q4, Netflix expects to gain 4.5 million new streaming customers, compared with 8.3 million in the year-earlier quarter. Netflix Basic With Ads is slated to launch in the U.S. on Nov. 3 and priced at $6.99 per month \u2014 three dollars less than the regular Basic plan.

During the third quarter of 2022, Asia-Pacific accounted for 1.43 million additional customers of Netflix, which constituted the majority of the company's net subscriber increase. With just 100,000 net customers added, the Netflix area of the US and Canada experienced the slowest growth.

Netflix posted robust annual EPS growth during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 as millions of customers worldwide sheltered at home and turned to streaming entertainment services. On a quarterly basis, profit growth began to decelerate during that period, slowing to 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and declining 5.9% in this year's first quarter.   Netflix's revenue grew by at least 20% annually between 2018 and 2020 and dropped to 8.6% in this year's second quarter.

Now that episode 3 has officially done its thing, we are right back in your faces to take you on a brief journey into the future as we explore what the next, new episode 4 of Chicago PD\u2019s current season 10 will be showing you when it comes out next Wednesday night, October 12, 2022. We were able to snag up an official teaser description for one of episode 4\u2019s main storylines via NBC\u2019s official episode 4 press release. So, we\u2019re going to certainly take a look at it right now. Let\u2019s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this new episode 4 of Chicago PD\u2019s current season 10. It turns out that the writers decided to name it, \u201cDONDE VIVES.\u201d It sounds like episode 4 will feature some more very scandalous, intense, dramatic, interesting, action-filled and suspenseful scenes. In the new episode 4, a shocking murder and a rookie officer will be the main focus of this storyline that NBC chose to serve up on a platter. Yep, it turns out that some major scandal will loom in this episode as very startling murder will take place at some point.\nThe tenth season of the American police procedural television series Chicago P.D. premiered on September 21, 2022, on NBC, for the 2022\u201323 television season. The season concluded on May 24, 2023. The season contained 22 episodes.   Chicago P.D. revolves around the members of the Intelligence Unit of the 21st District of the Chicago Police Department. The season stars Jason Beghe, Jesse Lee Soffer, Tracy Spiridakos, Marina Squerciati, Patrick John Flueger, LaRoyce Hawkins, Benjamin Levy Aguilar, and Amy Morton. Aguilar joined the series prior to the season premiere, after guest-starring in an episode of the previous season, while Soffer departed the series following the third episode. This season also includes the 200th episode of the series.  Jason Beghe who plays Hank Voight is now credited as an Executive Producer.  The team investigates a string of brutal pharmacy robberies and after Halstead gets into a fight with a suspect, stabbing the man to death, he chooses to turn himself into Chief Patrick O'Neal rather than go along with the cover story Voight and Upton had composed. Halstead later resigns from the Chicago PD, turns in his badge and announces he's returning to the Army to become the leader of a squad designed to track down the worst drug cartel targets, a position that will see him traveling to Bolivia.\nChicago PD Season 10 Episode 4: D\u00f3nde Vives Summary: A shocking murder pulls rookie officer Dante Torres into his own neighborhood.\nHe tells this to Upton who breaks down in tears. He leaves, but not before saying a fond farewell to Voight.  On February 27, 2020, it was announced that NBC had renewed Chicago P.D. through a tenth season.[25] The season is set to contain the two-hundredth episode of the series.[26]  In July 2022, it was reported by Deadline Hollywood that Benjamin Levy Aguilar, who plays Officer Dante Torres, had been promoted to a series regular after first appearing as a guest-star during the previous season.[27] The following month, it was revealed by Variety that Jesse Lee Soffer, who had portrayed Detective Jay Halstead since the series debut in 2014, would be leaving early in the tenth season.[28] Soffer made his final appearance with the third episode of the season, \"A Good Man\", on October 5, 2022.[29]  On May 16, 2022, it was revealed that the series would keep its Wednesday 10:00 PM ET timeslot, continuing to lead out of fellow Chicago franchise series Chicago Med and Chicago Fire.[30] On June 29, 2022, the season was given a premiere date of September 21, 2022.[31] After previously being available to stream on Hulu, all episodes from the season will begin streaming exclusively on Peacock the day after each episode airs on NBC.[32]\nD\u00f3nde Vives: Directed by Brenna Malloy.

Starting in November, most users will start paying $22.99 per month for YouTube Premium \u2014 though there seems to be some leeway. While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to their status as a \"long-standing and valued member.\" With the new price structure, the family plan is less of a bargain for smaller groups. At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts and $6.99 for students. The benefits haven't changed either, with Premium still offering users an ad-free YouTube experience, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, access to YouTube Music, and the ability to continue to play music and videos in the background or with your phone screen off. At least you still don't need to subscribe to Premium to watch videos in 4K.\nBy   \tTodd Spangler  NY Digital Editor  YouTube has raised the price on the YouTube Premium Family plan, the version of its ad-free, offline-viewing and music subscription service that provides access to up to six accounts.   \tIn the U.S., the price of YouTube Premium Family has gone up from $17.99 to $22.99 per month, an increase of 28%. According to Google, for existing members, the new monthly rate will go into effect for the first billing cycle that occurs at least 30 days after customers have been notified of the price increase.  \t\u201cWe don\u2019t make these decisions lightly, and we realize how hard this may be for our members,\u201d a YouTube rep said in a statement. \u201cThis new price reflects the complete value of YouTube Premium and will allow us to develop even more Premium features and continue to support the creators and artists you watch and listen to on YouTube.\u201d  \t               \tThe YouTube Premium Individual plan remains $11.99/month, while the Student plan (available only to eligible full-time students) is still $6.99/month.   \tYouTube Premium eliminates zero ads on all content, including music, provides downloads for offline viewing or listening as well as background playback (meaning you can continue to listen to audio if you\u2019re using other apps or if the screen is locked). The video giant also sells the ad-free YouTube Music Premium service for $9.99 per month in the U.S.\nSubscribers of YouTube Premium\u2019s Family Plan will have to pay an additional $5 for their subscription after the video-streaming platform upgraded the monthly fee by 28% to $22.99. YouTube made the announcement in an email to subscribers of the family tier in the US. The change has taken effect immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers were given a 30-day notice. The email to subscribers read: We created YouTube Premium to provide an uninterrupted YouTube experience, so you can get closer to the videos, creators, and music artists that you love. To continue delivering great service and features, we will be increasing your Premium family plan price from $17.99/month to $22.99/month.

Sony\u2019s Santa Monica Studio shared the date with a new CGI trailer, which depicts Kratos and Atreus fighting a horde of foes before facing off against Fenrir, a giant wolf. In a blog shared on July 6, Santa Monica Studio shared that pre-orders for the game will begin from July 15. The blog also details several different versions of the game that will be available, including a collector\u2019s edition that comes with a 16\u2033 replica of Thor\u2019s hammer. The confirmed release date is good news for fans, who have been waiting for months on news about the game\u2019s launch. At the Sony PlayStation Showcase on September 9, developer Sony Santa Monica and publisher PlayStation Studios announced that God of War Ragnarok has been delayed to 2022. Speaking during\u00a0a\u00a0Q&A, Herman Hulst,\u00a0Sony Interactive Entertainment\u2018s head of worldwide studios, talked about the pushback: \u201cSo we have, currently, two very big, very narrative-driven games in development:\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West\u00a0and the next\u00a0God of War,\u201d explained Hulst at the time. \u201cFor both of those, they\u2019re frankly affected by access to performance capture and talent.\nOh boy. The Norse realms seem even harsher in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. After years of anticipation and no concrete information since September 2021, fans are desperate to get their hands on this sequel. Sony finally saw fit to shed some more light on the project in a recent blog post. The story seems to pick up shortly after its predecessor leaves off, with Kratos and Atreus asking all the same questions fans have been wondering about since that cliffhanger finale. Here's everything you need to know about God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. Kratos and Atreus will continue their adventure in 'God of War Ragnarok.' After getting pushed back from an original release window of 2021, and a long time waiting, the official release date for God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is November 9, 2022. The announcement was made on the PlayStation blog along with a snazzy new trailer. As happy as many people are to see the game finally get an official release, it comes after a wave of intense harassment that the developers at Sony Santa Monica faced. Some developers even shared that they were being sent unsolicited Dick Pics due to the game not revealing a release date.  Yes, Sony Santa Monica revealed a three-minute trailer that goes into quite a bit of detail about the story of God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. In addition, a CG trailer was released along with the game's release date announcement. It features a big wolf!\nHere's the release date for God of War Ragnarok. God of War Ragnarok is official \u2013 for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony\u2019s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War\u2026 so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that\u2019s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\".\nQuestion:What is the release date of God of War Ragnarok?\nAnswer:"

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

On taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:   His Majesty the King [Her Majesty the Queen] has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.[41] Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3]  In 2010, the prime minister received \u00a3142,500 including a salary of \u00a365,737 as a member of parliament.[42] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.  The prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister.\nWe use some essential cookies to make this website work.

Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister on 25 October 2022. He was previously appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer from 13 February 2020 to 5 July 2022. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 24 July 2019 to 13 February 2020, and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government from 9 January 2018 to 24 July 2019.\nWhile there were rumours about a Johnson comeback over the weekend, he pulled out of the contest on Sunday. He had said that he had secured the backing of 102 legislators and could have been \u201cback in Downing Street\u201d but he had failed to persuade either Sunak or Mordaunt to come together and back him \u201cin the national interest\u201d. \u201cI believe I have much to offer, but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time,\u201d Johnson said. The Tories retain a majority in parliament, meaning that as their leader, Sunak will be named prime minister by King Charles III. Economists have questioned whether Sunak can tackle the country\u2019s finances while holding the party\u2019s multiple warring factions together. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt \u2013 the fourth person in that role in four months \u2013 is due to present a budget on October 31 to plug a black hole in the public finances, which is expected to have ballooned to up to 40 billion pounds ($45.2bn). Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,\u201d Deane told Al Jazeera. \u201c[Sunak] didn\u2019t have a direct electoral mandate,\u201d Deane said. \u201c\u2026 One of the things he is going to have to do \u2026 is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.\n\u201cThe whole list of tax cuts and ideas that frankly, according to Sunak and others, belongs to Disneyland because none of it was going to be really possible without crashing the economy more,\u201d he said. Sunak\u2019s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. \u201cThis decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,\u201d Mordaunt said in a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced. \u201cRishi has my full support.\u201d Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the UK\u2019s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK\u2019s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food. He will also inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the fortunes of several former Conservative leaders.\nQuestion:Who is the new prime minister of the United Kingdom?\nAnswer:"

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) \u2014 Rishi Sunak became Britain\u2019s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country\u2019s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.\u2019s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession \u2014 and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene \u2014 weakening Britain\u2019s fragile economy and obliterating Truss\u2019 authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil.

Considered a centrist and pragmatic politician, he emerged in the latest leadership contest as a safe pair of hands to guide the U.K., after Liz Truss' policy proposals around tax cuts and spending shook the government's credibility and spooked markets.  Sunak's rise in British politics has been nothing short of meteoric.

He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.

The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space \u2014 the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream \u2014 versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan \u2014 which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.\nWhen you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. What was once unthinkable finally happened: Netflix rolled out a cheaper streaming plan that includes ads. Netflix initially said that its ad-supported plan wouldn\u2019t arrive until 2023, but the \u201cBasic with Ads\u201d tier\u2013eventually renamed \u201cStandard with Ads\u201d\u2013went live in the fall of 2022, much sooner than expected. So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what\u2019s included? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Updated on July 19, 2023 with details on how \u201cBasic with Ads\u201d is now called \u201cStandard with Ads\u201d following the elimination of the ad-free \u201cBasic\u201d plan. Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, or $8.50 a month less than Netflix\u2019s least expensive ad-free plan. For some context, Paramount+ and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported, versus the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus) each cost $4.99 a month, while ad-supported Hulu costs $6/month. Meanwhile, HBO Max with ads goes for $10 a month, while Disney+ will charge $8 a month for its upcoming \u201cwith ads\u201d plan. As it stands, Netflix\u2019s cheapest ad-free plan, Standard, currently costs $15.49 a month for a single stream.

Reviews ethics statement      The ad-supported tier launched in November 2022.    Netflix said\u00a0Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called\u00a0Standard with ads\u00a0(formerly it was\u00a0Basic with ads). Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023.\u00a0  \"More than a quarter of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available,\" Greg Peters, Netflix's co-CEO, said in a news release. \"Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads plans.\"  Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans from other streaming services, like\u00a0Disney Plus\u00a0and\u00a0HBO Max\u00a0(soon to be called just Max). These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs\u00a0$7 a month.  Netflix said Wednesday that its ad-supported plan has almost 5 million global monthly active users, which is a different measure than subscribers, since multiple people in a household can use one Netflix account.\nJump to        With a vast library of TV shows, movies, and original programming, most people would agree that Netflix is an essential part of the entertainment landscape and easily one of the best streaming services you can sign up for. Like its competitors, the price of Netflix varies depending on which subscription tier and features you choose. Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month. And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September \u2014 an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month. It will cost more to add another user to a subscription plan.\nNetflix\u2019s ad tier is cheaper than those of a number of its fellow streamers. Disney+ and Hulu\u2019s ad plans will both be $7.99 per month when Disney+\u2019s ad tier launches in December, while HBO Max with ads is $9.99 per month.

Of course, this isn't the first time The Crown has taken a long break; there was a two-year wait between Seasons 2 and 3 too.   Although Netflix announced in January 2020 that The Crown's fifth season would be its last, months later, the streamer confirmed that the series would in fact get one more chapter.\nThe fifth season of The Crown, which follows the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II, was released by Netflix on 9 November 2022. It was the first season of the series to be released following both the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 9 April 2021 and the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022.  Imelda Staunton stars as Elizabeth, along with main cast members Jonathan Pryce, Lesley Manville, Jonny Lee Miller, Dominic West and Elizabeth Debicki. All cast members are new to the series; this season marked The Crown's final wholesale recasting, following the ensembles led by Claire Foy (seasons one and two) and Olivia Colman (seasons three and four).  The Crown traces the reign of Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 through to the early 21st century.[3]  The fifth season covers the time period between 1991 and 1997, and is set during the premiership of John Major.[4] Events depicted include Elizabeth's annus horribilis in 1992, Diana's Panorama interview, the separation and divorce of Prince Charles and Diana, Elizabeth's state visit to Russia, use of Prince Philip's DNA to identify the remains of the Romanov family, the decommissioning of Britannia, the handover of Hong Kong, and Major's departure from office and the beginning of Tony Blair's premiership.\n/vQrGU9pCRy The official poster for season 5 also has Diana and Charles in the forefront, hinting at the season's focus on their marriage with the logline, \"A house divided.\" While the couple stand at the edges of the frame, out of focus, Queen Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton) stands firm in full focus, as the center of the family. Netflix previously released a dispatch from the set of The Crown in September 2021, along with a tentative premiere month. In the clip from the streamer's fan event, Tudum, Imelda Staunton introduces herself as the show's new Queen Elizabeth II, while paying tribute to previous queens Olivia Colman and Claire Foy. \"On behalf of the cast and crew, we look forward to bringing you the next season of The Crown in November 2022,\" she says. We now also have the official trailer for the season. Soundtracked by a moody rendition of The Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony,\" the clip begins with a brief mention of the 1992 Windsor Castle Fire, before it focuses on the conflict raging within the family, as Princess Diana separates from Charles and The Firm attempts to keep her from speaking out.  New images from The Crown's forthcoming season show a brand-new cast completely transforming into members of the royal family.\nEvery item on this page was chosen by a Town & Country editor.

Given everything that's been happening in the royal family in the last few years\u2014including Queen Elizabeth's death in September, Harry and Meghan stepping back from their royal roles, and the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew\u2014fans of The Crown have been anticipating a season set in the modern day. Though the series likely won't make it all the way to 2022, the critically acclaimed show will have a few more chapters. Season 5 of the critically acclaimed series premiered in full on Netflix in November 2022, and is now nominated for four Golden Globes, including a nomination for Best Drama Series, as well as Imelda Staunton for Best Television Actress in a Drama Series, Elizabeth Debicki for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, and Jonathan Pryce for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series.  Staunton's nomination, in particular, has fans excited\u2014if she wins, all three of the actresses who have helmed the show in the role of Queen Elizabeth II will have garnered the Best Actress Golden Globe.

Amidst the buzz around Season 2, HBO confirmed that the series had been renewed for another season. There haven\u2019t been any details about returning cast members, but based on the Season 2 finale, we can guess that Tanya won\u2019t be among them. While filming has not yet begun, White has teased that he\u2019s interested in exploring \"death and Eastern religion and spirituality.\" Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction. The first two seasons of The White Lotus are now available to stream on HBO Max. Liam Gaughan is a film and TV writer at Collider. He has been writing film reviews and news coverage for eight years with bylines at Dallas Observer, About.com, Taste of Cinema, Dallas Morning News, Schmoes Know, Rebel Scum, and Central Track. He aims to get his spec scripts produced and currently writes short films and stage plays. He lives in McKinney, TX.\nThe White Lotus is an American black comedy-drama anthology television series created by Mike White for HBO.[5][6] It follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain, whose interactions are affected by their various psychosocial dysfunctions. The press release notes that \"each passing day, a darker complexity emerges in these picture-perfect travelers, the hotel's cheerful employees, and the idyllic locale itself\".[7] The first two seasons are set in Hawaii and Sicily respectively.  Intended as a six-part limited series, The White Lotus premiered on July 11, 2021, to critical acclaim and high ratings. The show's success led to HBO renewing it as an anthology series; a second season premiered on October 30, 2022.[8] In November 2022, the series was renewed for a third season.[9] While no official announcement has been made, Variety reports that the third season will be filmed in Thailand,[10] and that Natasha Rothwell will reprise her role as Belinda from the first season.[11]  The series received a positive critical response. It was included on the American Film Institute's list of the ten best programs of 2021 and 2022, and received various accolades including ten Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globes.  On October 19, 2020, HBO gave The White Lotus a limited series order that consisted of six episodes.\nThe first season was released on DVD on September 13, 2022.[64]  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90% for the first season of The White Lotus based on 96 critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though its true intentions can get a bit murky, gorgeous vistas, twisty drama, and a pitch perfect cast make The White Lotus a compelling\u2014if uncomfortable\u2014viewing destination.\"[65] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 82 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[66]  Matthew Jacobs of TV Guide rated it 4.5 out of 5 and wrote that it is \"some of the year's best television thus far.\"[37] Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall graded it 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it \"frequently uncomfortable, sometimes poetic, occasionally hilarious, and deeply idiosyncratic throughout.\"[69] White's attention to character detail was praised, with Naomi Fry of The New Yorker lauding his \"affection for his characters, who never feel like caricatures\",[2] and Judy Berman of Time commenting he is \"uniquely attuned to characters' internal conflicts as well as their varying level of self-awareness.\nThe Guardian, The Independent, New York Daily News, San Antonio Express-News, Sioux City Journal, Time, and Vulture; and third for Good Morning America, NME, and Uproxx, among others.[81]  For the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average score of 8.20/10, based on 118 reviews. The website's critics consensus states, \"Swapping its tropical trappings for Euro chic while focusing primarily on the corrosive influence of carnal desire, The White Lotus remains a cookie full of arsenic that goes down smooth.\"[67] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 81 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[68]  Multiple critics voiced that White repeated the success of the first season with sharp writing, his ensemble cast, and more focused plot lines, with some saying it is an improvement on the first season.[82][83][84][85] Lucy Mangan of The Guardian rated it 5 out of 5 and wrote, \"The writing is as dense and layered as ever, the plotting is immaculate and the viewers' sympathies \u2013 or loathings \u2013 are never allowed to rest in one place for too long.\nQuestion:Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place?By Luciana Bellini   Travel  |  22nd December 2022  Jennifer Coolidge reprises her role as the hapless Tanya in The White Lotus season 2, alongside her new husband Greg (played by Jon Gries), but the rest of the cast is filled with new faces, with more than a few you might recognise, including British actor Theo James, Aubrey Plaza of Parks and Recreation\u00a0fame and the ever-brilliant Tom Hollander.  While season one was filmed exclusively in the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, due to pandemic-related restrictions, for the second season they\u2019ve branched out from the dreamy environs of the hotel to take in some of Sicily\u2019s most beautiful towns and coastal spots, leaving one question on everyone\u2019s lips: just where was The White Lotus filmed? Here\u2019s our guide to all the key filming locations in The White Lotus season 2.\u00a0 As with the first season, most of the show is centred around the antics of the monied guests staying at an uber luxurious resort \u2013 in the first season that was the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, and for the second season the team chose another Four Seasons resort: the grand San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina. Situated high on the rocks, it offers up splendid views over the Ionian Sea, Mount Etna and an ancient amphitheatre.\nAnswer:"

Kyl resigned at the end of that year and Ducey replaced him with Martha McSally, who then lost to Democrat Mark Kelly in 2020. Primaries in Arizona took place on August 2. Kelly won renomination without opposition, while venture capitalist Blake Masters won the Republican nomination against a large field of candidates. Although Arizona typically leans Republican, Kelly led Masters by low single digits in aggregate polling. Kelly held a significant fundraising advantage until many Republican-aligned groups began spending to assist Masters in the final weeks of the campaign.[1] On November 1, Libertarian nominee Marc Victor dropped out of the race and endorsed Masters.[2][3][4]  Incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly won reelection, defeating Republican nominee Blake Masters by a comfortable margin.[5] This was the first time Democrats won a full term to this seat since 1962.

The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens. History also gives Republicans reason for optimism.\nBut Republicans could try to win over Democratic Senate moderates on some legislation.  If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden\u2019s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren\u2019t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.  Still, dozens of seats are in play, including many of those held by Democrats who won in suburban districts in 2018, winning the majority for the party that year.

And follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nAbout\u00a0Search  History suggests Democratic loss of control of both House and Senate. In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president\u2019s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president\u2019s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president\u2019s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.\nA Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.\nConnecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 ARTICLE Last Updated Dec. 7, 2022  IN THIS ARTICLE  What is the balance of power in the House?

The governor\u2019s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain undecided. Cortez Masto\u2019s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt\u2019s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters, 74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican House of Representatives candidate. More Republicans also plan to support Cortez Masto than other Democrats on the ballot. Even if this sample of Nevadans is unusually supportive of the incumbent senator, lower support among any likely Republican voters for Laxalt, in what others have polled as a very tight race, is noteworthy.\nAdvertisement Last updated Nov. 22, 2022 Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who is seen as vulnerable, is being challenged by Adam Laxalt, a former attorney general who helped lead former President Donald J.

Beto O\u2019Rourke performed better than expected in these majority-Hispanic counties.  \u2014 Nate Cohn Nov. 9, 2022 Democrats and Republicans each need to win three more competitive Senate seats to win control of the chamber (in addition to the races they are expected to win most easily). Here\u2019s the state of the closest races: \u2014 Lazaro Gamio Nov. 9, 2022 With more counties nearly finished counting, things keep looking better for Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. He\u2019s outperforming Biden across the state and is currently up 8 points in counties that were the closest in 2020.   \u2014 Alicia Parlapiano Nov.\nThe AP concluded Cortez Masto\u2019s lead would carry even if Republican Adam Laxalt made gains in rural Nevada counties that are still counting votes. Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada\u2019s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto\u2019s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno\u2019s Washoe County as well as among provisional and \u201ccured\u201d ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.  Those categories accounted for nearly 90% of the vote in 2020\u2019s presidential election.  The counties to watch are Clark (anchored by Las Vegas) and Washoe (which includes Reno).\nAdvertisement Nevada Election Results Sen.

Leonetti, from its financier Alcon Entertainment, slating it for release in select theaters and on VOD on December 16. (Watch Lullaby\u2018s new trailer, unveiled this morning, by clicking above.)  \tPic follows a new mother who discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and regards the song as a blessing. But her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith. Oona Chaplin (Avatar franchise) and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (The Affair) lead the cast, which also includes Liane Balaban (You Can Live Forever), Kira Guloien (Women Talking) and Moni Ogunsuyi (The Umbrella Academy).  \t           \tAlex Greenfield and Ben Powell wrote the script, with Alcon\u2019s Broderick Johnson and Andrew A.

Released as a single on 10 April 1989, the song is the band's highest-charting single in their home country, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart. It additionally reached number three in West Germany and Ireland while becoming a top-10 hit in several other European countries and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Tim Pope, won the British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.  The meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metonymy for addiction, depression, or sexual assault,[2] and Smith has offered multiple explanations as to its theme or content, such as childhood nightmares or abuse.[2] One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have.[3] Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.[4]  Upon its release, \"Lullaby\" became the Cure's highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. It remains their only single to reach the top five in the United Kingdom.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be in business with industry leader Alcon Entertainment to release horror aficionado John Leonetti\u2019s Lullaby,\u201d said Vertical Entertainment Partner Peter Jarowey. \u201cJohn\u2019s love of the genre is renowned, and we feel it is the perfect film that our audience will flock to this holiday season.\u201d  \tVertical Entertainment\u2019s current and upcoming releases include Michael Jacobs\u2019 Maybe I Do starring Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Richard Gere, William H.

                "value": "The TARDIS has a new passenger. The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started.\" \"Millie just is the companion,\" said Gatwa. \"She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail the universe with Millie!\nWe've known for a while that Ncuti Gatwa is the next (well, it's a little more complicated than that right now, so spoiler alert for lower down the page) incumbent of the TARDIS, due to debut as the lead in Doctor Who next year. Now we know who will be his first main companion \u2013 Coronation Street's Millie Gibson, playing Ruby Sunday. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor\u2019s companion,\" she says. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s side, I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\" Ncuti Gatwa adds: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!\u201d Russell T. Davies, who brought the series back in 2005 for its big relaunch, is returning to run it again starting next year.\nAlthough the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series\u2014including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.\nThe 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her \u201cfam,\u201d and in the big finale episode \u2013 \u201cThe Power of the Doctor\u201d \u2014 several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan filming Doctor Who Season 7 in New York City in April 2012.\nRussell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"It\u2019s the great honour of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already. She\u2019s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I\u2019ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that\u2019s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.\nQuestion:Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?\nAnswer:"

And now, photos exclusive to Vogue reveal that an Arab designer was a major part of the bride\u2019s big day. While she wore a Grace Kelly-inspired wedding gown by American brand Ralph Lauren to exchange vows with Peter Neal, Biden slipped into a sleek dress from Lebanese designer Reem Acra\u2019s namesake label for the reception and cake-cutting ceremony. Photo: Norman Jean Roy The ivory Mikado silk gown created by Beirut-born Acra came with a delicate strapless neckline, and was made notably special with pearls belonging to Biden\u2019s grandmother Roberta Buhle sewn into the sweeping six-foot train. Biden paired the dress with pearl jewelry of her own, and sheer gloves. Acra was also the designer of choice for First Lady Jill Biden, who wore two dresses from the brand on the day: A custom couture silk chiffon vintage blue dress with a teal wool crepe coat for the ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress for the black-tie reception. Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden is the daughter of US president Joe Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, and his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, and is an associate at the DC law firm Arnold & Porter.\nPresident Biden's granddaughter looked stunning in a long-sleeve gown. Ahead of Naomi Biden's wedding to Peter Neal, speculation over what designer President Biden's granddaughter would pick to design her wedding dress was high.  Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well\u2014as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.  The official social media accounts for President Biden and Dr. Biden tweeted, \"Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you.\" Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you. pic.twitter.\nDolan, who published the aptly-named wedding photography book \u201cThe Perfect Imperfect\u201d last year, was one of several authors at the nuptials. The bride\u2019s mother debuted \u201cIf We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction and Healing\u201d in June and her father released his memoir \u201cBeautiful Things\u201d last year.  \tFor the ceremony, the bride wore Tiffany & Co. Victoria earrings and the groom sported a Schlumberger single brooch from the company. Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn\u2019t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night\u2019s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian\u2019s Alexandra O\u2019Neill at Saturday night\u2019s reception at the White House. That independent New York-based female-founded brand gained international attention after First Lady Jill Biden wore a blue tweed coat with velvet lapels and a coordinating dress from the previously little-known brand.  \t           \tNaomi Biden\u2019s bridal choices stand to impact future brides, since high-profile weddings routinely create fashion trends and interest in the labels that were worn.\nLopez topped them all, though, donning three custom dresses from Lauren for her nuptials with Ben Affleck last summer. In hindsight, Neal\u2019s and Biden\u2019s attendance at the designer\u2019s fall fashion show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York may have been a sign of her intentions.  \t           \tThe location of the private affair \u2014 the South Lawn \u2014 was a first for White House weddings. After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House\u2019s South Portico with Biden\u2019s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president\u2019s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden\u2019s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday\u2019s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\u201cThat was a big, big yes, because they\u2019ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.\u201d  When Biden and Moon visited O\u2019Neill\u2019s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. \u201c[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cWe talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.\u201d Ten of O\u2019Neill\u2019s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. \u201cWe worked really closely together on this,\u201d she added.   The project was a joy for O\u2019Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.\nQuestion:Who designed Naomi Biden's wedding dress?\nAnswer:"

The second round of group-stage fixtures have been completed. And now, every team in Qatar whose World Cup fate still hangs in the balance knows exactly what they need to do to progress to the knockout stage. Three teams have already progressed. The reigning world champions, France. The 2016 European champions, Portugal. And the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to win in Qatar, Brazil. Advertisement Two teams are out. The host nation, Qatar. And Canada. But what does every other team at the World Cup need to do to make it into the last 16? GO DEEPER The Radar - The Athletic's 2022 World Cup scouting guide After two games for each team in Group A, there is a three-way battle between Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal for the qualification positions. Qatar have been already eliminated. Occupying top spot and facing the hosts in their final game, Louis van Gaal\u2019s side will more than confident of picking up the point they need to book a last-16 place but they have some work to do.

GO DEEPER Disjointed and defensive - the Netherlands did not look like the Netherlands  The other game \u2014 between second-placed Ecuador and third-placed Senegal \u2014 has a qualification shoot out feel to it.\nWorld Cup holders France are off to a strong start in Group D, where they are favorites to advance as the group leaders. Their 4-1 come-from-behind victory over Australia is a sign that they are not giving up their title without a fight despite a slew of injuries. Euro 2021 semifinalists Denmark are tipped to be the team best equipped to lay claim to the other knockout round berth on offer, but a 0-0 draw against Tunisia could hurt their chances.\u00a0 The Danes will now be sweating their Round of 16 berth given Australia did what they couldn't against Tunisia. The Socceroos claimed a 1-0 win over Tunisia to give themselves a shot at the Round of 16 in their group finale. That Australia vs. Denmark match on Wednesday will essentially serve as a playoff for a berth into the knockout rounds. It's worth noting that this group has reunited three teams that faced each other at the same stage of Russia 2018: France, Denmark and Australia were all part of Group C in that tournament, with France and Denmark going through and Australia finishing last. WORLD CUP GROUPS: Group A | Group B | Group C | Group D Group E | Group F | Group G | Group H The four teams selected into the group are playing\u00a0a round-robin format with each nation facing the other three.\nGroup standings are based on points from those three group-stage matches \u2014 three points for a win, one for a draw, none for a loss.\u00a0 The top two teams from each group based on total points advance to the single-game knockouts. If teams are tied on points, goal difference is the first tiebreaker followed by goals scored. If teams are also tied in those categories another set of tiebreakers is applied.\u00a0 The winners of the last World Cup in 2018, France will be determined to retain the crown, although they will have to fare considerably better than they did at Euro 2021, when they were knocked out at the Round of 16 stage by Switzerland.\u00a0 If superstar Kylian Mbappe is at his best, then it could make all the difference for Les Bleus, and there is plenty of other international experience also in Didier Deschamps\u2019 talented squad despite a rash of injuries heading into the tournament. France won the 2020/2021 UEFA Nations League by beating Spain in the final, and if they can perform as a cohesive unit then they will certainly be among the leading contenders for glory in Qatar. The Socceroos won a single-elimination FIFA intercontinental playoff to earn the final place in Group D, beating Peru in a penalty shootout on June 13.\nWhatever Deschamps says at half-time seems to be working, across all competitive games since the 2018 World Cup, France\u2019s attacking output in the second half is significantly better than the first 45 minutes. Deschamps\u2019 decision not to select Jonathan Clauss of Marseille and Aston Villa\u2019s Lucas Digne for his 25-man squad reflects his plan\u00a0to\u00a0revert from 3-4-1-2 to the 4-2-3-1 that was successful in 2018.

The top two teams, Argentina and Poland, advanced to the round of 16. This marked the first time that Mexico did not advance past the first round since 1978.[2]  The teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1 April 2022.[3] The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings.[3]  Notes  The first match of the group was between Argentina and Saudi Arabia. The two teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament, most recently in 2012, a 0\u20130 draw in a friendly game. Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina and ended their 36-match unbeaten streak.[6] According to Gracenote, the win was the \"most surprising\" in World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets in history.[7] This was also the second consecutive time that Argentina did not win their opening match at a World Cup, after drawing 1\u20131 with Iceland in 2018; and the first time since 1990 that Argentina lost their opening match.\nArgentina and Poland made it out of World Cup 2022 Group C as Mexico somehow didn\u2019t make it out and Saudi Arabia couldn\u2019t replicate their stunning win against Argentina.

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn\u2019t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven\u2019t been keeping track of Paramount+\u2019s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen. Overall, despite the series of changes coming the BAU's way, it's all for the better.\nParamount+'s new Criminal Minds series is Criminal Minds: Evolution.  By Mark McKee | Published 11 months ago  CBS had a relative TV goldmine from 2005 to 2020 when the FBI Behavior Analysis Unit traveled the country, bringing to justice the worst criminals within the borders.\u00a0Criminal Minds\u00a0revolutionized the murder mystery on TV with a stellar cast of characters that used their expert talents in human nature to chase after the worst the country had to offer. Spencer Reid, Derek Morgan, Jennifer Jareau, David Rossi, Aaron Hotchner, and Emily Prentiss captivated audiences for a decade and a half before the show came to an end in 2020. Fans didn\u2019t have to wait long for news of a revival, as the team couldn\u2019t stay away from a new series premiering this Fall on\u00a0Paramount+. The latest iteration of the series has now found its title.\u00a0Deadline reports\u00a0the\u00a0new series\u00a0will appear under the title Criminal Minds: Evolution.\u00a0 Just before the pandemic began, fans saw the BAU chase after The Chameleon to close out a series that had to create 15 years of diabolical murderers without allowing it to get stale. The series ended with Spencer Reid in a coma and traversing the memories of agents he worked with in the past.\nCook (JJ), Kirsten Vangsness (Penelope), Aisha Tyler (Tara), Adam Rodriguez (Luke) and Paget Brewster (Emily). As previously reported, Matthew Gray Gubler and Daniel Henney will not be reprising their roles as Spencer and Matt, respectively. Gilford\u2019s post-FNL TV credits include L.A.\u2019s Finest, Good Girls and, most recently, Midnight Mass. In officially confirming Criminal Minds\u2018 comeback back in July, Paramount+ president\u00a0Nicole Clemens said in a statement,\u00a0\u201cFor 15 seasons, Criminal Minds was at the forefront of cutting-edge scripted drama as it explored the psychology behind crime \u2014 thrillingly. The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at Paramount+. Erica, the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are sure will electrify audiences.\u201d Longtime Criminal Minds showrunner/EP Erica Messer will be back to oversee the revival, with\u00a0Breen Frazier and Chris Barbour returning as writers/executive producers.

It\u2019s a shame Matthew Gray Gubler won\u2019t be in it as Dr. Spencer Reid, he was my favourite character. So it will be hard to watch knowing he won\u2019t be in it. But no one person is bigger than any show. From what I\u2019ve read about it so far I\u2019m liking the new format, it will be different and interesting to watch a continuing story all through the season. I\u2019m really looking forward to it. \ud83d\ude0a The character they shouldn\u2019t really bring back is Hotch! The show was never as good with him! Not sure if I will watch. No Michael Gray Gubler, that\u2019s upsetting. It is the 16th season or a new series ?? I am really upset it will be on Paramount plus as I can\u2019t afford more money on our cable bill., as my husband and I are retired.   This was m y favorite show.  Many others are in our situation. I\u2019d love to see MGG in a reboot of the Ellery Queen Mysteries with him in the lead role. I love the show I\u2019ve watched it at least four\u2026.. I\u2019m so glad Criminal Minds is coming back! So sorry that the character Spencer won\u2019t be back. We loved his character so much. Without Spencer I hope they bring back Hotch.  I still miss him.  Four women and only 2 men is not fair.\nQuestion:What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?\nAnswer:"

Rhule will be introduced as the Huskers\u2019 31st permanent head coach at 1:30 p.m. in the Hawks Championship Center. Fans are invited to gather at Gate 20 on the east side of Memorial Stadium at 12:50 p.m. to welcome Rhule to campus. A special viewing of the press conference will be offered inside Memorial Stadium. Fans can also watch the introduction online. Rhule was announced as the new head coach on Nov. 26 by Trev Alberts, vice chancellor and director of athletics.  The 47-year-old Rhule has built an impressive coaching resume over the past 25 seasons with experience at both the collegiate and professional levels. Rhule has served as a head coach for the past 10 years, including seven seasons in the collegiate ranks and three seasons in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers. Alberts said success as the head coach at Temple and Baylor provides evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska. \"It is a privilege to welcome Coach Matt Rhule, his wife Julie, and their family to Nebraska,\" Alberts said. \"Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program.\n\"Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\" Rhule is taking the helm following the firing of Scott Frost and the promotion of Mickey Joseph as interim coach. Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 \u2013 the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost\u2019s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn\u2019t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation\u2019s five biggest conferences. Alberts previously said following the announcement of Frost\u2019s firing that expectations may be lower. \u201cWe will stop talking about championships or stop talking about things we used to do,\u201d he said.\nHis final season at Baylor included 11 regular season wins, a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game and a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl appearance.\u00a0 Then came a less stellar NFL stint that ended after an 11-27 record in two-and-a-half seasons. It\u2019s unclear what the exact contract details are as the Panthers owe over $40 million in buyout money. It\u2019s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach Mickey Joseph and Nebraska\u2019s assistants.\u00a0 Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago. The Huskers just wrapped up a 4-8 season and have not had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2016.\u00a0 But the financial resources, fan support, brand and facilities are in place to be competitive toward the top of the Big Ten. \u201cIt is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,\u201d Rhule said in a release. \u201cWhen you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top of the list.\u00a0 The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. sports@dailynebraskan.com Senior Sports Editor   Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.\nNebraska finished the season 4-8 after its upset of Iowa. Alberts was in attendance at Iowa City. The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule\u2019s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He\u2019s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he\u2019s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he\u2019s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d that he grew up \u201crevering\u201d the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. \u2014\u00a0Sherman He\u2019s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska \u2014 which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message.\nNew Head Football Coach Matt Rhule, live coverage right now on air @WOWT6News #Huskers pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn\u2019t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along with him, but said he would definitely be talking with \u2014 and listening to \u2014 players, coaches, and staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was fired, would be retained. \u201cI reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I\u2019ve been on both sides of it,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an assistant coach on a staff that\u2019s been let go, and I\u2019ve always appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I\u2019ll try to be thorough with that process over the next couple of days.\u201d Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely in Rhule\u2019s hands. \u201cUltimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule\u2019s decision,\u201d Alberts said. \u201cHe\u2019s the head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best opportunity.\u201d Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. \u201cMy son is this YouTube generation. I have seen the Tunnel Walk maybe 5,000 times.\nQuestion:Who is Nebraska's new head football coach?\nAnswer:"

Have you seen\u00a0Mandalorian? When they revealed Luke Skywalker, they made use of voice-cloning in that one. They also used a primitive version of TTS in\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0to give HAL a unique voice. In short, TTS tech is all about machine and deep learning that allows the program to read and convert text into audio files. Similar kinds of algorithms are used to analyze and then reproduce existing and create new voices, too. So, the text-to-speech voice on TikTok that you like hearing is actually an AI voice produced by an underlying speech synthesis algorithm that you can\u2019t really meddle with. But, even if you can\u2019t mess about with it as you would with some open-source voice-changer or TTS tool, it\u2019s still sufficient for quick video editing and TikTok voice-over work, and its popularity corroborates that. How to use TikTok\u2019s voice generatorTikTok\u2019s voice generator is not only cool but simple to use, too, and anyone can do it. Assuming you\u2019ve got the latest version of the app installed and assuming everything is working as it should, you just have to:Record a new video: Obviously, you can\u2019t generate any voices without a video to work with.\nIt seems that TikTok has found the perfect formula for online longevity. With its short-format videos favoring snappy, easily replicable, and endlessly reusable content, it\u2019s managed to grab and hold the attention of not only the youngest members in the audience it\u2019s often associated with but people of all ages and walks of life. What\u2019s truly remarkable about TikTok, though, is that it\u2019s managed to make text-to-speech voices and voice-overs a staple of social media content creation. Thanks to TikTok Voice (i.e., its text to speech feature), this video platform can quickly provide the user with additional functionality and accessibility since it allows them to hear what\u2019s on the screen. Today, we\u2019re focusing on TikTok\u2019s text to speech features and learning how to create an original sound that\u2019ll transform your TikTok videos.

BuzzFeed News Reporter BuzzFeed News Reporter At the end of every calendar year, dictionaries around the globe select one word to sum up how language morphed in the preceding 12 months, to recognize a trend in mainstream vernacular and comment on the human condition at that moment in time. Come December, we are bombarded with dozens of different words, which always cast a wide net, paint a vague picture, and interchangeably solicit reactions from \u201cyikes\u201d to \u201csure.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at the many words of the year, selected by the lexicographical powers that be. gaslighting (n.): \u201cthe act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one\u2019s own advantage.\u201d Why was it chosen: M-W cites the \u201cage of misinformation\u201d we live in, and a 1,740% increase in lookups of the word this year.

Also in the running: oligarch, Omicron, codify, LGBTQIA, sentient, loamy, raid, Queen Consort Ford Proctor and Austin Wynns of the San Francisco Giants after Proctor hit a grand slam home run against the Rockies on Sept. 29, 2022. homer (n.): \u201can informal American English term for a home run in baseball.\nOTHER MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARIES FOLLOW US \u00a9 2023 Merriam-Webster, Incorporated\nThe abbreviation was looked up frequently (up 1178%) during the entire month of June, Pride month, when the rights, equality, and culture of LGBTQ people are celebrated around the world. Lookups also spiked in late November after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs. With LGBTQ and the longer acronym both used in news stories about the event, interest in the difference between the two was apparent. Overall, LGBTQIA saw an 800% increase over 2021. In June, when a Google engineer claimed the company\u2019s AI chatbot had developed a human-like consciousness, lookups of sentient increased 480%. The claim was vigorously denied by Google, and the engineer was placed on paid leave, but the question of how human-like AI is, or will be, became a topic of much interest. 2022 was also the year that many people discovered the joy in puzzling out five-letter words: both Wordle (in which the puzzler has six tries to identify one word) and Quordle (nine guesses to identify four words) sent people to the dictionary, with numerous seldom-searched-for words tapped out on keyboards everywhere.

On December 1, 2022, CNBC confirmed the news and also shared that SM Entertainment has signaled their future recruitment plans in Singapore through an email. On top of that, the K-pop label also plans to kickstart retail businesses in Singapore, including cafes, merchandise stores, pop-up stores, and more. Moreover, the company will not limit its expansion to Singapore but wants to establish itself in the Middle East too. As per CNBC, the Singapore headquarters will also overlook ventures in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, while simultaneously communicating with the Korea office. For a wider reach in Asia, SM Entertainment is going beyond the Korean borders to establish its Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore. Although the company has not shared the financial details of the Singapore venture, they plan to hire locals to grow their staff count in the country. Moreover, they are planning to recruit undergraduates or fresh graduates for internships. In his interview with CNBC, Lee Soo-man, founder of SM Entertainment, said his team likes to nurture talent through the Cultural Technology system he developed years ago. The systematic K-pop training system, started by Lee Soo-man, allows singers and dancers to excel in four stages: casting, training, marketing/management, and producing.

Despite declining to share specifics of the company\u2019s investment in its expansion into Singapore, representatives of SM have shared that it is currently \u201cin the midst of hiring more local talents, which will hopefully increase the full-time staff count\u201d. Its Singaporean office is also looking to hire \u201clocal undergraduates or fresh graduates for internships\u201d.\n23] The firm's first release from SM was Super Junior's fifth studio album, Mr. Simple, which marked the end of SM's self-distribution.

Since joining the brand in 2021, she has contributed to a number of different verticals, writing and editing SEO content ranging from relationship timelines to TV and movie explainers. Prior to joining PEOPLE, Kelsie worked at POPSUGAR as the Celebrity and Entertainment editor, where she wrote and edited content and conducted various interviews for online and video at press junkets, red carpets, and events such as Tribeca Film Festival. She was also formerly at Bustle, Tiger Beat, and Her Campus and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Warner Bros. Pictures brought Barbie to life with its highly-anticipated film of the summer.   Directed by Greta Gerwig, the project was in the works for quite some time. Back in December 2016, Amy Schumer was originally attached to star, however, she later backed out of the film due to creative differences.   In January 2019, it was confirmed that Margot Robbie would be taking on the lead role of the iconic Mattel doll and in October 2021, Ryan Gosling joined the cast as Barbie's plastic partner, Ken.\nMargot sits in a bright pink convertible with her hands on the wheels, against a matching pink background. But as fab as Miss Margot is in her Barbie get-up, multiple actresses are playing Barbies in the upcoming film. Emma Mackey is confirmed to be playing Barbie as well as Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and Issa Rae. Confused? You'll just have to wait and see what kind of movie magic director Greta Gerwig whips up for the film!  Emma Mackey spoke to Empire and exclusively confirmed that all of the Barbies got together at the beginning of shooting and had a sleepover together \u2014 which is so cute that we can hardly handle it. Emma revealed that their activities involved \"playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa].\" The Sex Education actress seemed happy about her Barbie role, saying, \"It\u2019s great to do comedy because Emily was a sad, dark drama. Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.\u201d We like to think that the sleepover was pink, too \u2014 were there pillow fights and matching pink PJs? How do we score a pair?!  The one and only Ryan Gosling will be playing Barbie's boyfriend, Ken \u2014 we're doodling virtual hearts already. And besties, we finally have a photo of the actor as Barbie's BF.\n\u201cWhen I was trying to make my name as an actress, creative roles for women were limited,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s BAZAAR in her December 2018/January 2019 cover story. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pick up another script where I was the wife or the girlfriend\u2014just a catalyst for the male story line. It was uninspiring.\u201d Speculation about Robbie\u2019s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn\u2019t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach. Now, the Little Women filmmaker is set to direct the film as well, as sources have confirmed to Variety. (Robbie mentioned it in a recent interview as well.) Fans will have to wait a couple years to see this film come to life.\nRumours about Lipa's involvement in the film started in May 2022, so we're very pleased they became a reality (as real as Barbie gets anyway...).  As for the line-up of Ken dolls, as well as Gosling, of course, three-time Emmy winner Will Ferrell is joined by the likes of Marvel's Simu Liu, new Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, One Night in Miami...'s Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Grace and Frankie's Scott Evans.  Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'  She also spoke about her feeling towards playing Barbie in the film, saying: 'It's great to do comedy. Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.\nPrepare to watch Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, and Simu Liu ham it up in Greta Gerwig's dreamscape. Come on Barbie, let\u2019s go party! A new clip from Greta Gerwig's Barbie just dropped, and it looks like we won't be spending all of our time in the real world this weekend. As Margot Robbie (Barbie) tells America Ferrera, we're officially going to Barbieland. Still, everyone's favorite Mattel doll has her sights set on more than just a little fun. The preview may look like a candy-colored dreamland\u2014but after she's leaves Barbieland, Barbie (and... Ken) go on an epic adventure to the human world in search of true happiness.  Barbie is Gerwig's latest directorial endeavor, which she wrote alongside her partner, Noah Baumbach. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie\u2014or, at least, one of the Barbies\u2014and Ryan Gosling and his cursed platinum blonde hair will take on Ken.)  The trailer begins with Barbie saying hello to her fellow dolls, while Ken vies for her attention. Then, we get all-too-brief glimpses of Robbie, Gosling, Issa Rae, and Simu Liu hamming it up in the Barbie-verse before Barbie and Ken decide to leave town.

During Berhalter\u2019s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. \u201cA lot of credit to my teammates,\u201d Adams said, \u201cbecause anyone throughout our leadership council can wear that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way.\" Adams debuted for the Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  The United States men's national team's 26-man roster for the 2022 FIFA World Cup is officially out after coach Gregg Berhalter released the team in an event last week in New York.

The United States men's national soccer team (USMNT) is making their return to the World Cup after its embarrassing failure to qualify for the 2018 tournament. It was the first time the U.S. had missed the World Cup since the 1980s.  Now, in a quest to turn the page, the U.S. will feature one of its youngest World Cup teams ever, handing its reputation over to a new generation of players.  \"This generation hasn't yet defined themselves.\nHis emotional control and composure are a huge part of what he does.\u00a0 \"He is not afraid to 'carry the water', to do the dirty work, to really grind. His communication style is not all big speeches, it's very one-to-one. He listens as much as he talks. And he can communicate nonverbally, because people pick up on that better.\" Walker didn't instantly concur with the method Berhalter chose in allowing his players to pick the World Cup captain but says the coach \"wore me down.\" He made the point that such a democratic way of choosing a leader only works if the culture of your group is strong. The longer this tournament progresses, the more united this USA squad appears. \"Tyler is the perfect captain for this group,\" Walker added. \"He is one of them. It is remarkable to think, he's the same age as (Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback) Trevor Lawrence. He's younger than (current Steelers QB) Kenny Pickett. He's younger than the Michigan punter. This could be an NCAA team by age, and their main leader reflects that.\" Christian Pulisic is the best-known U.S. player and has the nickname \"Captain America\" at Chelsea, but Adams' role and spot on the field are better suited to the captaincy.\nQuestion:Who is the captain of the USA soccer team in the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022?\nAnswer:"

Yahoo Finance has crowned the 2022 Company of the Year. We're going to bring you the details, plus interviews with top executives all day here at Yahoo Finance. You don't want to miss it. - Oh my. I wonder who it is. But first, a check on the markets. Futures are slightly in the red here to start the week after a better than expected jobs report on Friday casts doubt on how quickly the Fed can ease the pace of interest rate hikes. - Plus, stocks in Hong Kong and mainland China are in rally mode after local authorities took more steps to ease COVID-19 policies, giving hope of a full reopening in China. - But we begin today with my favorite story. The end of the year is upon us. And that means Yahoo Finance, we have unveiled or officially announced its 2022 Company of the Year. The land of $1.50 hot dogs and unmatched customer loyalty takes the crown this year. And you guessed it, it's Costco, folks. I flew out to the Costco stomping grounds in Washington to go inside the retailer's business. Here's what I learned. Costco has seen a lot since opening its first warehouse store in Seattle, Washington in 1983.\nCostco Wins Yahoo Finance's 2022 \"Company of the Year\" Award: In a year of eye-popping inflation for everything from gas to eggs hammering households, Costco played the role of trusted friend. The retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam\u2019s Club did. Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in the summer months. The company was often the last grocer to raise prices on household essentials despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive sales gains seemingly every month of the year, a stock price that relatively out-performed the S&P 500 and Yahoo Finance\u2019s coveted \u201cCompany of the Year\u201d award. The headlines for online-car buying platform Carvana (CVNA) haven\u2019t been good recently. And whether the company will remain a public entity is now in doubt.  In fact my colleague Rick Newman wrote a column dubbing it Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cWorst Company of the Year.\u201d Despite a stock down XX% this year, concerns over its debt load, and weather management has the know-how to right the business, it seems one thing may actually stick around - the trend of buying used cars online.\nIt\u00a0seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today. Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year\u2019s woes include a wrong turn into the \u201cmetaverse,\u201d where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion. Other Company of the Year setbacks? Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block\u2014as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down.\nIt\u2019s still too early to tell how far Zoom\u2019s ambitions will take it, but for now, the company has proven itself to be a formidable force in a year of unpredictability.

Block is back to Square 1. And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the \"meme\" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it\u2019s down 87%%. Zoom out. Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so. Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation\u2019s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up\u2014including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises. Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don\u2019t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory.\nQuestion:Which company won Yahoo Finance's 2022 \"Company of the Year\" Award?\nAnswer:"

The bailout was approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to\u00a0more than 200\u00a0nearly insolvent multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. \"With today's actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve,\" Biden\u00a0told\u00a0the cheering crowd at a Cleveland high school. Millions of union workers, that is. If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way\u2014even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security\u00a0looms on the brink of insolvency. Oh, and you'll have to pay back (with interest!) the money borrowed to make\u00a0this\u00a0bailout (and the rest of the American Rescue Plan) possible.

It comes from\u00a0the American Rescue Plan,\u00a0a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that he signed into law in 2021. \u201cThis matters,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis matters for workers \u2026 This matters for their spouses, this matters for their mothers and fathers who they\u2019re taking care of \u2026 It matters for the country.\u201d Many union retirement plans have experienced financial pressure because of underfunding and other issues.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

O\u2019Brien said in a written statement. But when the retirement fund faltered, union members turned to lobbying the federal government for help.  \u201cThis is an issue of fairness \u2014 of this country keeping its word to hardworking, honest people who did everything they were supposed to do in life,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.  Multiemployer pension funds are created by agreements between unions and companies and are partially insured by the federal government\u2019s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The insurance program was on track to become insolvent in 2026, but the pandemic relief money is expected to keep it on firm footing through 2051.  Biden traveled to Ohio in July to highlight the final rules for the pension relief program. Before Thursday, the program had awarded aid to 36 troubled pension plans, but none of those had received more than about $1.2 billion. The amount going to the Central States Pension Fund represents somewhere between one-third and one-half of the total estimated cost of the federal aid program.  The retirement plan has participants in almost every state, with the largest concentration in the Midwest.\nWithout the federal assistance, Teamster members could have seen their benefits reduced by an average of 60 percent starting within a couple of years. \u201cUnion workers and their families are finally able to breathe a huge sigh of relief, knowing that their hard-earned retirement savings have been rescued from steep cuts,\u201d said Lisa Gomez, assistant labor secretary for employee benefits security.

The Maxwell Award has been presented to the College Player of the Year since 1937 and is named in honor of Robert \u201cTiny\u201d Maxwell who was a former standout at the Swarthmore College and a renowned sports writer and football official. The Maxwell Award watch list will once again incorporate a broad spectrum of Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs and conferences from coast to coast, led by Bryce Young (Alabama) who was the 2021 winner. Young is joined by 7 additional returning semifinalists, Grayson McCall (Coastal Carolina), C.J. Stroud (Ohio State), Tanner Mordecai (SMU), Sean Tucker (Syracuse), Bijan Robinson (Texas), Brennen Armstrong (Virginia) and Sam Hartman (Wake Forest). The full list consists of 85 players with Ohio State having 3 candidates and an additional 14 schools having two players represented. Young joins A.J.

He's the fourth USC player to win the Maxwell Award, the first since Marcus Allen in 1981, when Allen also went on to win the Heisman Trophy. Williams was also the CBS Sports Player of the Year this season. Max Duggan did beat out fellow Heisman Trophy finalists Caleb Willams and C.J. Stroud for the Davey O'Brien Award, given to the nation's best quarterback, and his honor came as part of a big night for TCU. Sonny Dykes was named the winner of the Home Depot Award, given to the Coach of the Year, and cornerback Tre'vius Hodges-Tomlinson became the second TCU player in three years to win the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's best defensive back.\nAnd though the award was given out earlier in the week, these honors add to TCU offensive coordinator Garrett Riley winning the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant.\u00a0 Alabama linebacker Will Anderson was a big winner of the night, taking home the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for the second straight season as the defensive player of the year and adding a Bednarik Award \u2014 also given to the defensive player of the year \u2014 to his impressive list of accolades.

                "value": "1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament\u2019s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime. Advertisement Senegal followed in Cameroon\u2019s footsteps in 2002 in South Korea and Japan \u2014 in more ways than one. They beat the defending champions (France) in the tournament\u2019s opening game on their way to qualifying for the knockout stages.\nPreliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).  All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.\nSo one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.\n1934: Egypt, 1970: Morocco, 1974: Zaire, 1978: Tunisia, 1982: Algeria & Cameroon, 1986: Algeria, 1990: Egypt, 1994: Cameroon & Morocco, 1998: Cameroon, Morocco, South Africa & Tunisia, 2002: Cameroon, Nigeria, South Africa & Tunisia, 2006: Angola, Ivory Coast, Togo & Tunisia, 2010: Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria & South Africa, 2014: Cameroon, Ivory Coast & Ghana, 2018: Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal & Tunisia, 2022: Cameroon, Ghana & Tunisia Egypt were the first team from Africa to play at the World Cup \u2014 losing 4-2 to Hungary in the first round in Italy in 1934. Including their elimination, African teams have fallen in the first round 38 times. However, even when African sides have bowed out early it has rarely been without incident. Some notable highlights have been Zaire reportedly not knowing the rules for a free kick in 1974, Roger Milla dancing by the corner flag in 1990 and South Africa\u2019s Siphiwe Tshabalala\u2019s opening goal in the 2010 tournament \u2014 the only one to be held in Africa \u2014 resulting in a continent exploding in joy.\nQuestion:Who is Africa's first World Cup semi-finalists?World Cup 13  Morocco have become the first African team to ever make the semi-finals of the World Cup after their sensational victory over Portugal on Saturday. African countries have been competing at the World Cup since 1934 \u2014 Egypt withdrew in 1930 after missing their connecting ship to Uruguay as a result of a storm \u2014 and have made a total of 49 appearances in the competition.

The Prize, which is named to honor one of the world\u2019s greatest humorists, will be awarded at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy. Broadcast details will be announced at a later date. The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly. \u201cAdam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,\u201d said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year\u2019s recipient. \u201cAdam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.\nAs a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Sandler will receive a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Mark Twain sculpted by Karl Gerhardt (1853\u20131940).

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. annually since 1998, except for the years 2020 and 2021. Named after the 19th-century humorist Mark Twain, it is presented to individuals who have \"had an impact on American society in ways similar to\" Twain.[1] The JFK Center chose Twain due to his status as a controversial social commentator and his \"uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly.\"[1] A copy of Karl Gerhardt's 1884 bust of Twain is presented in an autumn ceremony at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, during which the honoree is celebrated by his or her peers. The event is a significant fundraiser to benefit the Kennedy Center, which sells tickets as well as access to dinners and after-parties featuring the celebrities.  As of 2023[update], 24 individuals have been awarded the honor: six women and 18 men. Bill Cosby's award was rescinded by the Kennedy Center in 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no awards in 2020 or 2021.[2]  In 1997, Murray Horwitz brought the idea of a dedicated comedy award, on par with the Oscars, Grammy Awards or Tony Awards, to John Schreiber and Mark Krantz, partners in an entertainment firm.\nSandler is the seventh former SNL cast member to receive the honor.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \tPaul Grein   UPDATE (March 8): Dana Carvey, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Tim Herlihy, Idina Menzel, Rob Schneider and Ben Stiller have joined the roster of artists scheduled to salute Adam Sandler as this year\u2019s recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

                "value": "The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA\u2019s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association\u2019s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth doing. Yeah, it\u2019s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.\u201c Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn\u2019t have a background in college athletics or higher education.\nMedia Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J. DeGioia announced by mutual agreement with the board that Mark Emmert will be stepping down as president of the NCAA.\u00a0 He will continue to serve in his role until a new president is selected and in place or until June 30, 2023.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Throughout my tenure I've emphasized the need to focus on the experience and priorities of student-athletes,\" said Emmert.\u00a0 \"I am extremely proud of the work of the Association over the last 12 years and especially pleased with the hard work and dedication of the national office staff here in Indianapolis.\" \"With the significant transitions underway within college sports, the timing of this decision provides the Association with consistent leadership during the coming months plus the opportunity to consider what will be the future role of the president,\" said DeGioia. \"It also allows for the selection and recruitment of the next president without disruption.\" NCAA member schools adopted a new constitution in January and are in the process of transforming the structure and mission to meet future needs. 08.07.23 08.03.23 08.03.23 08.02.23 08.02.23 Thanks for visiting !

That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal.\nIsn't this whole thing supposed to be for and about them? ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm.\nCharlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time.           Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as \u201cgoing from the frying pan and into the fire.\u201d           \u201cI don\u2019t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that\u2019s the reason I took the job,\u201d said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. \u201cI could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.\u201d           As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions.           On the first day of the men\u2019s basketball tournament, Baker \u2013  who played basketball at Harvard \u2013 discussed with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers.           And he also told CNN why he thinks there\u2019s so much excitement for March Madness.\nQuestion:Who is the new president of the NCAA?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Musk has hired former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino, who modernised the advertisement business at the media firm. Former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino will become Twitter\u2019s new CEO, current chief executive Elon Musk says in a tweet, as the social media platform seeks to reverse a plunge in advertisement revenues. \u201cI am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!\u201d Musk said on Friday. \u201c@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.\u201d Yaccarino, who modernised the advertising business at the Comcast Corp entertainment and media division, will have her hands full as she takes on a firm loaded with debt, among other challenges. Since Musk acquired Twitter in October, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 percent of its staff. Musk this year acknowledged that Twitter suffered a massive decline in advertisement revenue. Musk has axed thousands of employees, rushed the launch of a subscription product that allowed scammers to impersonate major brands and suspended users with whom he disagreed. Twitter\u2019s \u201ctrajectory will immediately take a 180-degree turn\u201d under Yaccarino\u2019s leadership, said Lou Paskalis, a longtime advertisement industry executive and CEO of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it\u2019s now called \u2014 and it\u2019s a woman. He did not name her but said she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter \u201cprobably toward the end of this year.\u201d (May 11) Elon Musk confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal\u2019s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with deep ties to the advertising industry.  \u201cI am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!\u201d Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino \u201cwill focus primarily on business operations\u201d while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships.  Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which is now called X Corp.  Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at Twitter, however.  \u201cWhile he\u2019s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step back from calling the product shots,\u201d said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.\n152] On October 16, 2008,[153] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[154] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and \"be completely focused on product strategy\".[155][156]  According to The New York Times, \"Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship\" when Williams was away.[157] According to PC Magazine, Williams was \"no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company\". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to \"help in any way [he could].\"[158] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[157]  In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[159] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.\n160] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an \"annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million\".[161] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[162] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[163] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[164] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[165] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[166][167] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[168][169]  In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[170] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2\u00a0billion in share buybacks.\nAs broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers their brand messages were not an afterthought.

He said in December that he would step aside as CEO once he found \u201csomeone foolish enough to take the job\u201d. On Thursday, Musk tweeted that he had found a CEO without naming Yaccarino. One person close to Yaccarino said Musk\u2019s tweet may well have accelerated the timetable for her to join Twitter, which would be a balm to Tesla shareholders. Shares of Tesla were down 1.3 percent on Friday even as analysts commented that a CEO hire would allow Musk to concentrate on the electric car business. Comcast shares were little changed.\nQuestion:who is the ceo of twitter?\nAnswer:"

'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009\u2019s Avatar\u2014the highest-grossing film of all time\u2014opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported\u2014nearly double the $26.7 million the first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150 million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5 million) and The Batman (56.6 million). It was also narrowly edged out by Jurassic World Dominion, another sequel in the rebooted Jurassic Park franchise, which made $59.5 million on its opening day.\n\u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d didn\u2019t make quite as big of a splash as many assumed it would, but James Cameron\u2019s big budget spectacle still helped breathe life into the box office this weekend.

Everything \u201cAvatar\u201d is oversized, though: the Na\u2019vi characters, the runtime (a staggering three hours and 12 minutes), the technical advancements and the release strategy from 20th Century Studios and The Walt Disney Co.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.\nThe stop-motion \u201cPinocchio\u201d from Netflix took the Best Feature prize, as well as feature film awards for Best Character Animation (Tucker Barrie), Best Direction (del Toro and Mark Gustafson), Best Music (Alexandre Desplat, Roeban Katz, del Toro, Patrick McHale), and Best Production Design (Curt Enderle, Guy Davis).                     \t\t\t\t \t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\t\t\t                2024 Oscars: Best Visual Effects Predictions                  2024 Oscars: Best Supporting Actor Predictions           However, in winning Best Indie Feature at the Annies, A24\u2019s \u201cMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\u201d stepped up as the primary challenger. The acclaimed stop-motion/live-action hybrid also scored Annies for Best Voice Acting for co-creator Jenny Slate and Best Writing \u2014 Feature (director Dean Fleischer Camp, Slate, Nick Paley, Elisabeth Holm). Although it was a critical favorite and is very well liked, the challenge has been getting it seen by more voters.

He would become the first Best Director (\u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d) winner to also grab Best Animated Feature.\nHowever, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]  From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]  In 2010, the Academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol (2009) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future. This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, James stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as Bailey put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\nWATCH LIVE The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. Guillermo del Toro wins Oscar for best Animated Feature Film for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio LOS ANGELES -- \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" has had an Oscar wish come true. The director's stop-motion, musical take on the puppet who longs to be a real boy won Netflix its first animated feature trophy on Sunday. The category has primarily gone to either a Walt Disney or Pixar-produced film for the past decade - with the exception of \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" \"Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. We are all ready for it. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" Del Toro said. \"Pinocchio\" was considered the contender to beat. It swept several awards including the Golden Globe and the top honor at the animation industry's Annie Awards. The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. It earned rave reviews for a stunningly beautiful production that takes a dark look at issues of love and mortality between the titular puppet and surrogate father, Gepetto. A polar opposite of Disney's 1940 version, this \"Pinocchio\" references Catholicism, fascism and the ugliness of war.\nEven though 'Puss In Boots: The Last Wish' put up quite a fight, 'Pinocchio' has dominated the circuit  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tClayton Davis  Senior Awards Editor  Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis.

                "value": "2022 YG is a near-Earth asteroid and a potential quasi-satellite of Earth, discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov at Nauchnyi, Crimea on 15 December 2022. It has an estimated diameter of 16\u201330 meters, given H of 26.6, and an albedo 4-15%.[a]    This near-Earth asteroid-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\nOur planet has a strong gravitational connection with the Moon. But sometimes the gravity of the Earth can also capture small asteroids, which then remain for a certain period of time, orbiting us as a kind of temporary moon. This has happened at least twice this century: \u201cmini-moons\u201d have remained in Earth\u2019s orbit for several years or even less. But the newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG has probably been trapped in gravity for several decades. An interesting space rock was first observed on December 15, 2022. Interestingly, one of the first to notice it was amateur astronomer Henadii Borisov from Crimea, also known for the discovery of the first known interstellar comet, which now bears his name.\u00a0 Asteroid 2022 YG, as it is originally catalogued, has a diameter of 16-30 meters. Early computer models of its orbit showed that it completed a total orbit of the Earth in one year. Moreover, this has been happening since about 1961. The simulation showed that the quasi-moon will continue to orbit the Earth until 2181, when it can finally free itself from the gravity of the Earth. Visualization of the orbital data for the year 2022 YG also shows that it takes a strange path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a rounder orbit and stretching again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats.\nA new co-orbital asteroid for Earth? @AdrienCoffinet noticed that newly-discovered asteroid 2022 YG has been circling Earth as a quasi asteroid since 1961 and will continue to do so until 2181. More observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for 2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats itself.\u00a0 Watching the asteroid's projected path over a period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous \"mini moons\" included asteroids 2020 CD3\u00a0and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will be with us deep into the next century.\u00a0 There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past. An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a 1960s rocket launch instead.\nThe space rock looks to have been captured by our planet's gravity over 60 years ago.    An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.\u00a0 Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.\u00a0 The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.\u00a0 Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break free from Earth's gravitational hold.\nHe said it was \u201cfascinating that we can pull additional observations of known objects or entirely new objects out of surveys and datasets.\u201d At UW, Eli was also the president of the Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group, studying at Manastash Ridge Observatory in Ellensburg, Washington.

This has become a trend for Netflix to release a buzzy title in the days leading up to Christmas. In the past, hit films such as Don't Look Up, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Bird Box, and 6 Underground were released on the service during the holiday season. Rebel Moon will have a limited theatrical release in the weeks before it lands on Netflix. As of right now, it is unknown when that'll be and how many theaters will screen the film. Snyder's previous film with Netflix, Army of the Dead, screened for one week in May 2021 across 600 theaters in the US. Rebel Moon will likely follow a similar route.  There is no trailer for Rebel Moon. That being said the first pieces of footage for the film were released in a sizzle reel for Netflix's 2023 film slate, which you can watch above. A behind-the-scenes featurette for Rebel Moon was unveiled during Netflix's Tudum event on June 17, 2023, previewing the film's massive scope and several of the cast-members reactions to working with Snyder on the film.\nTrending TV, movie and anime news, plus reviews and analysis. As Zack Snyder\u2019s sci-fi epic Rebel Moon heads to Netflix, here\u2019s everything you need to know from its release date and trailer to cast, plot, and more. Director Zack Snyder is known for his stint in the DCEU, with movies such as Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. Now, after leaving the DCEU behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead and the forthcoming Rebel Moon.  The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023\u2019s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for the streaming platform. So, if you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ll want to be updated with all things Rebel Moon. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.  Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023. The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2.  Filmed back-to-back, Zack Snyder\u2019s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the Netflix space opera we know today.\nEverything you need to know about Zack Snyder's new sci-fi movie franchise for Netflix. by Tigran Asatryan  Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2. The new movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale. Here\u2019s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad,\u00a0who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman\u2019s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.  Snyder commented on the inspiration for Rebel Moon in his THR interview: \u201cThis is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a Star Wars fan. It\u2019s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure.\u201d @Netflix Let's go! https://t.\nZack Snyder\u2019s epic space fantasy Rebel Moon is coming to Netflix this year. From the mind of Zack Snyder comes\u00a0Rebel Moon\u00a0\u2014 and we\u2019re getting a sneak peek. In an action-packed new teaser that debuted at Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Tudum: A Global Fan Event, fans finally got a chance to feast their eyes on the visionary auteur\u2019s eagerly awaited new sci-fi fantasy epic. \u201cI thought I knew what a big movie was until I came onto this,\u201d says one of the film\u2019s stars,\u00a0Ed Skrein, amidst an eye-candy assault of behind-the-scenes footage that includes wild green-screen battles, grueling weapons training and fiery explosions. Front and center in the new featurette are star Sofia Boutella and director Snyder himself, who says that he has been dreaming up the\u00a0Rebel Moon universe for more than two decades.\u00a0 The details on the blockbuster are still hush-hush, but here\u2019s what we know: A small peaceful colony on the outskirts of the galaxy is targeted by the insidious Imperium (embodied by a deliciously evil Skrein). But they won\u2019t be facing down the forces of darkness on their own. A team of intrepid warriors will soon come to their aid and turn the tide against the interplanetary interlopers.\nA young woman is then sent out to assemble a team of warriors from neighboring planets who can help them fight back. Rebel Moon is clearly a big deal for Netflix, which is on the hunt for more homegrown franchises to line up alongside Stranger Things and The Witcher in the ongoing battle for streaming supremacy.\u00a0Snyder himself told the Hollywood Reporter, \"my hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.\" On top of the previously mentioned Rebel Moon sequel, Forbes say an RPG videogame may also be on the cards, while extended, R-rated versions of both confirmed Rebel Moon movies are seemingly on the way (via SlashFilm). Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it. Netflix isn't usually in the habit of showing off its wares half a year ahead of release, so it's still a little early for a full Rebel Moon trailer. Nonetheless, we have been treated to a tiny bit of footage courtesy of the streaming platform's 2023 preview.

Babylon, which was released in theaters on Dec. 23, 2022, came to the streaming platform on Feb. 21, 2023 \u2014 about two months after its debut. If Scream VI follows the same trajectory, we could be watching it from the comfort of our homes by mid-May 2023. Viewers are saying that they want to view the new horror movie Scream 6 on Hulu. Unfortunately, this is not possible since Hulu currently does not offer any of the free episodes of this series streaming at this time. It will be exclusive to the MTV channel, which you get by subscribing to cable or satellite TV services. You will not be able to watch it on Hulu or any other free streaming service. The Scream franchise debuted in 1996, with a screenplay by Kevin Williamson (then best-known for creating Dawson\u2019s Creek) and director Wes Craven, a lifelong horror fan who created the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The film was a huge commercial and critical success, bringing in almost $200 million at the box office worldwide, while helping to revive the \u201cslasher film\u201d genre (just see all the other horror films that were made after the success of Scream). The opening scene with Drew Barrymore remains one of the most memorable \u2014 and most-spoofed \u2014 scenes today.\nParamount's latest installment in the Scream franchise released in theaters on March 10, and now Scream 6 is available to stream online If you\u2019re looking for a frightfully delightful horror movie, you will want to know where to watch Scream VI, the latest installment in the popular Scream franchise.

As of April 2023, the sixth movie has grossed over $169 million at the box office. With new and returning cast members and a new twist on the tale, critics and audiences are already labeling Scream VI as a new re-ignition of the franchise and a frightfully thrilling delight for fans of the horror genre.  Scream VI has joined the rest of the films in the franchise for streaming on Paramount Plus. It was released for streaming on Paramount Plus on April 25. You can also watch the rest of the franchise on Paramount Plus.

Under the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged, CBO projects that real GDP will grow by 3.1\u00a0percent in 2022\u00a0(as measured from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022). That expansion is driven by strong growth in consumer spending and real business investment and by a shrinking U.S. trade deficit (see Table 2-2). The growth of real GDP declines steadily through 2024, led by slower growth in consumer spending and investment, before remaining almost constant through 2026. In the agency\u2019s projections, real GDP grows at an average annual rate of 1.6\u00a0percent from the beginning of 2023 through 2026.  Data source: Congressional Budget Office. See www.cbo.gov/publication/57950#data. Real values are nominal values that have been adjusted to remove the effects of changes in prices. Data are annual. Changes are measured from the fourth quarter of one calendar year to the fourth quarter of the next. Data and definitions are based on the national income and products accounts. GDP = gross domestic product; * = between -0.05 percentage points and 0.05 percentage points. a.

In terms of underlying trends that contribute to growth of real potential GDP over the 2022\u20132031\u00a0period, revisions are very modest, and the average annual growth rate over the period, slightly greater than 1.8\u00a0percent, is practically unchanged. In nominal terms, however, the agency\u2019s projections of output and income are higher throughout the projection period because projected inflation over the next several years is above the rates anticipated in July. Nominal GDP is 4.9\u00a0percent higher, and national income is 3.9\u00a0percent higher, in 2031 than CBO projected last summer. CBO currently projects the unemployment rate to be slightly lower and the labor force participation rate to be slightly higher over the 2022\u20132031 period than in the agency\u2019s July 2021 forecast. CBO\u2019s current projection of the average unemployment rate over the 2022\u20132026\u00a0period is slightly lower than it was in that earlier\u00a0forecast\u2014now 3.8 percent, down from 4.0 percent. The current projection of the labor force participation rate is also lower\u2014now 62.1\u00a0percent instead of 62.4\u00a0percent.\nGDP = gross domestic product; PCE = personal consumption expenditures; * = between zero and 0.05 percent. a.

Real potential GDP grows at a marginally faster rate.3 The level of real GDP is slightly below the level of real potential GDP from 2027 to 2032, in line with their historical relationship, on average.\nThe decrease in residential fixed investment mainly reflected a decrease in new single-family construction as well as brokers' commissions.

You remember Billy, a constant runaway from the Philadelphia foster homes he's been forced to endure since his teen mom deserted him. Billy's foster bestie is Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) picked him as his successor. \"Put your hands on my staff,\" demanded the Wiz. \"Gross!\" said Billy, in a response that typified the script's \"Deadpool\"-lite irreverence. I'm pleased to report that cheeky attitude still pops through in \"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\" as Billy/Shazam and his kid besties, now in adult superhero bodies -- Adam Brody for Freddy, Meagan Good for Darla, Ross Butler for Eugene,  D.J. Cotrona for Pedro and Currey playing both versions of Mary -- take on their greatest challenge yet.\nDespite the uncertainty during the interim period in the wake of Shazam!'s massive success \u2014 having received critical praise and earning $365 million worldwide \u2014 production for its sequel has wrapped, a trailer debuted and a release date has been set.   Here's everything to know about Shazam! Fury of the Gods.   Shazam! Fury of the Gods wouldn't be possible without the return of its titular character played by Zachary Levi. Plus, his teenage counterpart Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel, will also be making his return.   Other cast members set to reprise their roles include Jack Dylan Grazer, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Jovan Armand and Grace Caroline Currey as Billy's foster siblings \u2014 while their superhero alter egos will be played by Adam Brody, Meagan Good, Ross Butler and D. J. Cotrona.   New cast members have been recruited to join the sequel as well, including Helen Mirren as Hespera, the daughter of Atlas, alongside Lucy Liu who's cast as her demigod sister, Kalypso. They are the primary villains in Shazam's second installment.   Rachel Zegler, who starred in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake, is also cast as their sister in the film, playing the role of Athena, one of three goddess daughters of the Titan Atlas \u2014 of which the actress said \"was so much fun\" to play.\n\"She is so wonderfully complex and getting to work with Helen and Lucy was amazing,\" Zegler said in a video interview during Comic Con. \"Miss you ladies! We have to get the goddesses back together for a catch-up soon!\"   Shazam! Fury of the Gods serves as the sequel to Shazam! released in 2019. The film continues the story of Billy Batson who \u2014 upon reciting the magic word \"SHAZAM!\" \u2014 is struck by the Living Lightning of the gods and transformed into his adult superhero alter ego.   \"Levi returns as the kid-at-heart superhero who is bestowed with the powers of six gods: the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles and the speed of Mercury,\" per Deadline. \"While Shazam is a formidable champion, Billy is still just a fun-loving kid trying to navigate high school while learning how to use his powers.\"   Billy \"and his family are thrust into a battle for their superpowers, their lives, and the fate of their world,\" in the upcoming movie, according to an official synopsis for the movie from DC's website.   Have no fear: the same Shazam! filmmaking team is back for round two! Screenwriter Henry Gayden and director David F. Sandberg are slated to return for Shazam! Fury of the Gods.\n26] In October 2020, the release date was once again shifted to June 2, 2023. Later release dates were December 16, 2022 and December 21, 2022. In August 2022, the final release date of March 17, 2023 was announced.  In June 2020, Marta Milans confirmed that she would reprise her role as foster mother Rosa V\u00e1squez from the first film, and revealed that filming had been delayed by the pandemic.[15] The film's title was revealed to be Shazam! Fury of the Gods during the virtual DC FanDome event in August 2020, with returning cast members confirmed including Asher Angel as teenager Billy Batson and Levi as his adult superhero counterpart, Jack Dylan Grazer as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman and Adam Brody as his adult counterpart, Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley and Meagan Good as her adult counterpart, Grace Fulton as Mary Bromfield, Ian Chen as Eugene Choi and Ross Butler as his adult counterpart, and Jovan Armand as Pedro Pe\u00f1a with D. J. Cotrona as his adult counterpart.[7][11] The next month, Levi said filming would begin in early 2021.[11]  The film's release was delayed again in October 2020, to June 2, 2023.\nBetween who's joining the cast and when it's slated to premiere, here's everything to know about the sequel to 2019's Shazam! starring Zachary Levi Skyler Caruso is the Editorial Assistant of PEOPLE Digital.  No magic word needed: a Shazam! sequel is already underway!   DC Comics' hit superhero movie is getting a reprisal with Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the highly-anticipated follow-up film that comes four years after its predecessor's theatrical release in April 2019.   Zachary Levi is making his return as the titular superhero character opposite Asher Angel, who is reprising his role as Shazam's teenage alter ego, Billy Batson. Familiar faces from the franchise are also set to appear in the film's second installment, plus several newcomers.   The news of Levi's return, specifically, came amid fan speculation that he would be cut from the franchise as the studio's newest CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran reconfigured the future of DC movies including Henry Cavill's departure as Superman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 3 being canceled.   In addition to concerns regarding the cast, backlash arose surrounding DC Studios' future storylines. Gunn posted a statement on Instagram reading, \"Disrespectful outcry will never, ever affect our actions\" regarding the company's upcoming movie slate \u2014 to which Levi commented, \"Amen. \ud83d\ude4f.\"\nQuestion:Who will be playing the role of Billy Batson in Shazam!

                "value": "Jerry Seinfeld, trapped in algorithmically generated limbo Seinfeld was famously described as \"a show about nothing,\" and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre, AI-generated Seinfeld episode has been streaming on Twitch for a full month, titled \u201cInfinite Nothing.\u201d The never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much \u201cabout nothing,\u201d as algorithmically animated Seinfeld characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 language model, with minimal human moderation. In an interview with Vice, Skyler Hartle, the co-creator of \u201cNothing, Forever,\u201d explained the thinking behind the project: \u201cThe actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project,\u201d Hartle said. \u201cBut then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\u201d \u201cAside from the artwork and the laugh track you'll hear, everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music,\u201d one of the creators wrote in a Reddit comment.\nThe result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI\u2019s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they\u2019re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: \u201cAs generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.\u201d After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn\u2019t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying.\nThe surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it\u2019s never really gone away \u2013 it\u2019s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the \u201cstory\u201d \u2013 if you can call it that \u2013 of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, \u201cwe have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be \u2018formed\u2019, so to be speak,\u201d Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. \u201cWe collectively call this logic the \u2018director\u2019, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole.\n\u201cIn addition to the third party services we\u2019ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be \u2018formed\u2019, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the \u2018director,\u2019 as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole,\u201d Hartle said via email. \u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that we don\u2019t generate the artwork or the laugh track \u2014 those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.\u201d  Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of \u201990s point-and-click games that came out around the same time as Seinfeld. \u201cWe thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically relevant,\u201d Hartle said over email.  This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn\u2019t really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.  One popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It\u2019s titled, \u201cElaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.\nThe fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.\nQuestion:What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?\nAnswer:"

The bill establishes a framework and funding for education savings accounts (ESAs), which may be used by eligible families to cover tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses at accredited nonpublic schools in Iowa. The State Board of Education adopted administrative rules on May 4, 2023, that specify definitions for the program, eligibility requirements for participation, parameters for the application process, and program administration and accountability.

Parents/guardians will receive a message from Odyssey asking them to confirm their email address.\u00a0After the email is confirmed the parent/guardian can sign in to the Odyssey platform to begin their application.  Parents who choose to enroll their eligible children in an accredited nonpublic school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funding allocated to public school districts for the same budget school year.\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under Iowa\u2019s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds\u2019 voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.\nDES MOINES\u00a0--\u00a0Governor Reynolds signed HF 68 into law today amid hundreds of supporters in the Iowa State Capitol. The\u00a0Students First Act\u00a0makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools.\u00a0 \u201cPublic schools are the foundation of our education system and for most families they will continue to be the option of choice, but they aren\u2019t the only choice,\u201d Governor Reynolds stated. \u201cFor some families, a different path may be better for their children. With this bill, every child in Iowa, regardless of zip code or income, will have access to the school best suited for\u00a0them.\u201d\u00a0 Universal eligibility will be phased in over three years. All incoming Kindergarteners and all public-school students will be eligible beginning year one with the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Eligibility for families of children currently enrolled in accredited private schools will be income based over the first two years.\u00a0 Parents or guardians who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all\u00a0public school\u00a0districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses. The state has issued a request for proposal (RFP) from businesses with experience managing ESA programs.\nThe Iowa Senate passed SF 2369, and Democratic Rep. Konfrst said in a press release that the bill would harm more Iowa K-12 students than it helps. When looking at the number of vouchers available and the cost to provide them, she is technically right.   Lauren White, Politics Reporter April 7, 2022 PolitiFact Iowa is a project of The Daily Iowan\u2019s Ethics & Politics Initiative and PolitiFact to help you find the truth in politics. If your time is short Back in January, the opening of the Iowa legislative session was full of discussion about letting parents choose their children\u2019s education. Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.\u00a0 \u201cIf the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,\u201d Konfrst said in the press release.\u00a0 SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice.\nIowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the option of choice \u2013 and they should be. But public schools aren\u2019t the only choice, and for some families, a different educational path may be better for their children.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governor Reynolds believes Iowa\u2019s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Students First Act signed into law\u00a0 On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address.\u00a0The bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools. It also provides public schools\u00a0with additional categorical funding for students who live in their district but attend private schools,\u00a0and allows public school districts to use unspent money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries.\u00a0 Education Savings Accounts\u00a0 With the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses.\nQuestion:What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?\nAnswer:"

Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by The Recording Academy of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".[2]  According to the category description guide for the 54th Grammy Awards, the award is reserved for albums \"containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&B vocal tracks\" which may also \"incorporate production elements found in rap music\".[3]  From 2003 to 2011, a separate category was formed, the Best Contemporary R&B Album, meant for R&B albums that had modern hip-hop stylings to them, while more traditional and less electronic-styled R&B music still fell under the Best R&B Album category. After the 2011 Grammy season, the Best Contemporary R&B Album category was discontinued and recordings that previously fell under this category were shifted back to the Best R&B Album category. This was part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories.[4] In 2020, a sister category titled Best Progressive R&B Album was debuted.\nGoldDerby Home    Forums    Music    2023 Grammy R&B Field Predictions We don\u2019t have a thread yet and we 75% through the eligibility period.

                "value": "Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public\u2019s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company\u2019s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google\u2019s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google \u2014 more than any other big tech company \u2014 has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I.\nDigital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It\u2019s an AI chatbot, and it\u2019s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn\u2019t officially replaced Google Assistant, it\u2019s a far more powerful AI assistant. That\u2019s because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI \u201clearn\u201d natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public.\nFrom imagining the prime minister leading a cabinet meeting about war to a guide on how best to start your own podcast, Google's LaMDA AI is certainly flexible. By  Tom Acres, technology reporter   Saturday 5 November 2022 19:41, UK The scene is 10 Downing Street, the home of the prime minister. It's a crisp, cool day. A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos, realistic speech, and even write fiction.                    Is this the future of comedy?

On Wednesday, Google held an event in its Paris office where the tech giant detailed plans to use AI technology to radically change how people search for information online. Google\u2019s event came one day after rival Microsoft announced a revamped version of Bing powered by a more advanced version of the AI used by ChatGPT. (Microsoft is investing billions in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.)           In the presentation Wednesday, a Google executive teased plans to use this technology to offer more complex and conversational responses to queries, including providing bullet points ticking off the best times of year to see various constellations and also offering pros and cons for buying an electric vehicle.           The executive said AI technology would pave the way for the \u201cnext frontier of our information products.\u201d     \u2014 Anna Cooban in London contributed reporting.

Whether it\u2019s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That\u2019s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago \u2014 and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we\u2019ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore\u2019s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. It\u2019s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people.

Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called \"prompts\", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.[1][2]  The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022.[3] The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion.[4] Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable.[5] Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands.[6]  Midjourney, Inc. was founded in San Francisco, California by David Holz,[7] previously co-founder of Leap Motion.[8] The Midjourney image generation platform first entered open beta on July 12, 2022.[3] However, on March 14, 2022, the Discord server launched with a request to post high-quality photographs to Twitter/Reddit for system's training.  The company has been working on improving its algorithms, releasing new model versions every few months. Version 2 of their algorithm was launched in April 2022[9] and version 3 on July 25.\nRob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What\u2019s your role and title? David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is Midjourney\u2019s mission?  We like to say we\u2019re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it\u2019s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society? I\u2019m definitely more concerned about society than business. We\u2019re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. Right now, our professional users are using the platform for concepting.\nAs per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn\u2019t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It\u2019s basically augmenting our speed,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d\u00a0 This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only \u201ctake inspiration\u201d from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that\u2019s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney\u2019s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.\u00a0 \u201cThe number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don\u2019t fully know how to respond yet. They\u2019re like, David, \u2018let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,\u2019\u201d he explained.\nHe ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.\nThey say, \u201cI feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it\u2019s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.\u201d  But there\u2019s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit; I don\u2019t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.\u201d Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don\u2019t have a process for that yet, but we\u2019re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn\u2019t have that many artists in it. It\u2019s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like \u201cwe don\u2019t really feel intimidated by this\u201d answers. Right now, it\u2019s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we\u2019re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that\u2019s been surprising to me.\nQuestion:who founded midjourney?\nAnswer:"

Microsoft announced a new version of its search engine Bing is integrating artificial intelligence chat in a step the tech giant hopes will bolster its place in the online search business (Feb. 7) (AP Video: Manuel Valdes) REDMOND, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft\u2019s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that\u2019s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.  Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \u201cThink of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful\u201d than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview. A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge.\nKnown as \"Tiger\", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.[29] In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes \"Sidebar\", a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search query.[8]  The BitFunnel search engine indexing algorithm and various components of the search engine were made open source by Microsoft in 2016.[9][30]  On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing that included a new chatbot feature based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[31] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[32] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[33] On May 4th, Microsoft switched from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remains available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app, but no longer requires a Microsoft account (there are limitations).[34][35][36][37]  When Microsoft demoed the new Bing to journalists, it produced several hallucinations, including when asked to summarize financial reports.\nMicrosoft Bing (commonly known as Bing) is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.  Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called \"Explore pane\") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.[4]  In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search.[5] Yahoo! finished the transition in 2012.[6]  In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as \"Tiger\", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.\nIs this self-harm? If it is, we catch it. And then we don't even let it go into the model,\" he said. \"An important part of today is, now we can go to market and try it with real testers, because you can't solve these problems in the lab. You have to get out and see it in the real world.\"                  Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi shows off the company's relaunched Bing search engine powered by artificial intelligence.

The new Bing also allows users to ask questions and receive answers that sound conversational based on the latest news, unlike the publicly available version of ChatGPT, which was limited because it relied on 2-year-old information.  The AI powering Bing uses technology that is faster and more advanced than what the public has experienced so far, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, told reporters, and it has been fine-tuned by Microsoft to be optimized for search.  \"I feel like we're been waiting this for 20 years, so I'm very excited it's here,\" Altman said. \"I think this is the beginning of a very new era.\ntoday to try sample queries and sign up for the waitlist. We\u2019re going to scale the preview to millions in the coming weeks. A mobile experience will also be in preview soon. We\u2019re excited to put the new Bing and Edge into the real world to get the critical feedback required to improve our models as we scale.

See Press Release Here.  Ben sent an email to employees at Pinterest, which we are sharing below: From: Ben Date: Tuesday, June 28, 2022 Title: Help me welcome our new CEO, Bill Ready Dear Team,\u00a0 After more than a decade running Pinterest, I\u2019ve decided to move into a new role, Executive Chairman. While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I\u2019m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.\u00a0 I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story. Over time, I decided he would be an outstanding CEO for our next chapter. Our board of directors met him and felt the same way.\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE: PINS) today announced that co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, Ben Silbermann will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman, and online commerce expert Bill Ready will become Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective June 29, 2022.   Ready is joining Pinterest from Google, where he served as President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users and oversaw Google\u2019s vision, strategy and the delivery of its commerce products. Prior to Google, Ready served in various senior leadership roles at PayPal, including Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.   With over 400 million monthly active users, Pinterest has built a healthy advertising business that generated strong cash flow and doubled revenue during the pandemic. In addition, Pinterest has been laser-focused on putting Pinners first, continuously improving its roadmap, investing in creators, shopping and scaling internationally.   \u201cBuilding Pinterest with such a wildly talented, kind and creative team has been the gift of a lifetime,\u201d said Silbermann. \u201cToday, Pinterest inspires hundreds of millions of people with ideas for every aspect of their lives. We\u2019ve built a growing global business that puts the well-being of our users at the core of everything we do. And we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\nSilbermann continued, \u201cIn our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments. And he shares our passion for creating a positive corner of the Internet. I\u2019m confident he\u2019s going to be an outstanding CEO.\u201d   \u201cOn behalf of the Board, I am thrilled to welcome Bill to the Pinterest team,\u201d said Andrea Wishom, Pinterest Board Lead Independent Director. \u201cBill is a proven leader, whose experience in payments, product development, and shopping uniquely positions him to take Pinterest to its next phase of growth. It is a testament to the remarkable vision and leadership of Ben that we are able to welcome Bill, who shares similar values. The Board and I look forward to working with them both to accelerate Pinterest's strategy of bringing everyone the inspiration to create the life they love.\u201d   \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to join Pinterest,\u201d said Ready. \"I have long admired the brand and platform that Ben and the Pinterest team have created and everything the Company stands for. I am excited to build on that foundation to further scale the Company\u2019s ecosystem and drive increased value for shareholders. Having built multiple businesses from zero and operated at the scale of billions of users, I have a deep appreciation for what it takes to scale a business like this to the next level.\nMost recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo.\u00a0 At his core, Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet\u2014a place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it.\u00a0 As you can imagine, this was a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder\u2019s love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways. That\u2019s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm.\u00a0 I\u2019m not leaving. Being executive chairman will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days.\u00a0 When we started Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited minutes!\nThe co-founder will stick around as Pinterest\u2019s first executive chairman. Curiously, PayPal was reportedly looking into buying Pinterest back in October 2021. Days later, the payments firm squashed the \u201crumor\u201d in a note to investors, saying it was \u201cnot pursuing an acquisition\u201d at that time.\nQuestion:Who is the new CEO of Pinterest?\nAnswer:"

Before the September 2022 Nintendo Direct,\u00a0Nintendo hadn\u2019t\u00a0shared anything about the Pikmin 4 release date since 2017.

We also recommend you head over to the Nintendo YouTube account to find even more gameplay and Pikmin 4 fun.    Pikmin 4 gameplay looks very similar to previous games in the series but with an adorable chunky dog named Otachi.\nFor now, Pikmin 4 is planned for Nintendo Switch, but it might also come to whatever the company\u2019s next console is, as well \u2014 similar to the way Pikmin 3 launched on Wii U and then later came to Nintendo Switch. The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn\u2019t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel\u2019s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that\u2019s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar\u2019s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries. The final Pikmin 4 trailer shows off more aspects of the world, including home interiors.\nThis fourth entry has been a long time coming, with Shigeru Miyamoto saying back in 2015 that it was \u201cvery close to completion.\u201d Seven years later, it\u2019s finally set to release in July. This installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren\u2019t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game. Check out our Pikmin 4 review for more details.

Outside of the new Pikmin types, Oatchi will be a major gameplay addition. Aside from being able to fight for you, he will have new abilities you can unlock and upgrade, such as riding him in water and having him break through obstacles in the world. Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night \u2014 a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It\u2019ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo\u2019s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once. With Pikmin 4 utilizing the power of the Switch, more Pikmin than ever can appear on screen, but that doesn't mean you can just grind out an entire army right off the bat.\nQuestion:What is the release date for Pikmin 4 on Nintendo Switch?\nAnswer:"

This round follows a previous cut of 11,000 jobs. SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:  Meta is planning a second round of layoffs. That's the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. And it announced yesterday it will cut another 10,000 jobs. This follows 11,000 layoffs at Meta last November. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that 2023 will be Meta's, quote, \"year of efficiency.\" He also says it will be, in his words, stronger and more nimble. We're joined now by Wall Street Journal technology reporter Sam Schechner. Sam, thanks for coming on.SAM SCHECHNER: A pleasure to be here.PFEIFFER: These are a lot of layoffs, but I want to make sure we put it in the overall context of how large Meta is. So tell us, how many employees does it have now? How many will it have left once the layoffs are done?SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the company said.\nMeta has started another round of layoffs amid the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d The latest job cuts are the third round of a series of cuts first announced in March. The company said it expected to shed a total of 10,000 jobs over the course of three rounds. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many workers are impacted by the latest round, but the layoffs, once again, seem to be primarily in non-engineering roles. People in marketing, communications, and recruiting have lost their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited posts on LinkedIn. Meta will also be slashing nearly 500 jobs from its Irish office, about 20 percent of its workforce in the country, according to a separate report. Meta declined to comment on the cuts. A spokesperson pointed to a memo Mark Zuckerberg shared with employees last fall when the company conducted an earlier round of 11,000 layoffs. In the message, he said that economic conditions had \u201ccaused our revenue to be much lower\u201d than expected. He described  the job cuts as \u201csome of the most difficult changes we\u2019ve made in Meta\u2019s history\u201d and \u201cwhat we need going forward.\u201d Zuckerberg has talked openly about the need for more \u201cefficiency\u201d in the months since. He  dubbed 2023 as Meta\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d and said he wants to create a \u201cflatter\u201d management structure at the company.\nSo if we're going by that and we add it together - you know, 21,000 people being let go - that could be nearly a quarter of Meta's workforce.PFEIFFER: That's a lot. And how big a deal do you think that is in terms of the impact it has on the company?SCHECHNER: Well, I mean, you can see it from - people inside the company are anxious.

But there's also this vision that he's trying to get across of a leaner, more nimble company. And he's actually, at points in this memo, talking about how he thinks it will - and is making things operate more efficiently, more effectively than before.PFEIFFER: During the pandemic, Meta and many other tech companies were just hiring madly. So are these layoffs essentially returning Meta to its pre-pandemic level, or do you see it going deeper than that? Any idea?SCHECHNER: Well, we'll have to see where it ends up landing. But, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, in this memo, what struck me is that he said that this is something that he sees continuing for many years. It's a new economic reality.\nSo if we're going by that and we add it together - you know, 21,000 people being let go - that could be nearly a quarter of Meta's workforce. PFEIFFER: That's a lot.

In a letter to staff posted to the corporate website, he cited a decline in e-commerce, the wider economic downturn, increased competition, and a decline in ad sales\u2013the primary way the company makes money.   \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" he wrote.  The layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so-called metaverse, pitched as a virtual-reality future in which people will work, mingle, exercise and go to concerts. But it's an unproven bet on the future, and not all everyone is convinced it should be the social media company's focus.                   Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made big investments in the \"metaverse,\" which he showed off during a virtual event last year. Last week, Zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13% of its staff.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced the company was laying off 13% of its staff. Zuckerberg said the workforce cuts would affect the whole organization, with recruiting staff disproportionately affected due to fewer hires anticipated in the coming year.

According to a document iRobot filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, it also was the second time Amazon tried to buy the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner and other household robots. The new information reveals more background on how Amazon, which already has a large robotics presence in Massachusetts, scooped up one of the area\u2019s oldest and most influential robotics firms. Amazon first tried to buy iRobot in the fall of 2016, the filing said, but iRobot\u2019s board of directors determined the offer \u201cundervalued\u201d the company at $60.50 per share. In the coming months, iRobot\u2019s stock price increased, and Amazon ended its acquisition discussions. Advertisement The next time Amazon expressed interest in buying iRobot was on May 16 of this year, when an Amazon representative called Colin Angle, cofounder and chief executive of the company. Amazon proposed acquiring iRobot for $64 per share in cash about a month later. Again, iRobot believed Amazon\u2019s offer undervalued the company. On June 29, iRobot issued a counteroffer to Amazon, asking for $70 per share. On the same day, iRobot told Amazon that it anticipated a second-quarter earnings miss. This meant iRobot also planned to lower its revenue projection for the year.\n\u201cSince we started iRobot, our team has been on a mission to create innovative, practical products that make customers\u2019 lives easier, leading to inventions like the Roomba and iRobot OS,\u201d said Colin Angle, chairman and CEO of iRobot. \u201cAmazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I\u2019m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.\u201d Amazon will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including iRobot\u2019s net debt. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by iRobot\u2019s shareholders and regulatory approvals. On completion, Colin Angle will remain as CEO of iRobot.

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs  defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38\u201335. The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14\u20133 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24\u201314, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38\u201335 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker. Butker's game winning kick was set up by a pivotal and controversial defensive holding call on Philadelphia cornerback James Bradberry, which was criticized by some observers but supported by others.\nThe conference championship games are over and the countdown to Super Bowl LVII begins.

Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the game.      The Philadelphia Eagles will play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. The Eagles are playing in the Super Bowl for the second time in six seasons following their 31-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC championship title. The Eagles are looking to win their second Super Bowl title following their victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII in 2018. The Chiefs reached the Super Bowl with a thrilling 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC championship game. Harrison Butker\u2019s 45-yard field goal in the closing seconds sealed the win for the Chiefs on Jan. 29. It marks the second Super Bowl appearance in three years for the Chiefs following their loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV in February 2021.

SM also breaks out the financial performance of its various subsidiaries within its filing, including live entertainment company Dreammaker, which saw its revenues soar by 569.6% YoY to 24.5 billion South Korea Won ($18.4m) in Q3. That growth was driven by the reopening of concerts both domestically within South Korea and internationally following a lengthy break due to Covid.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.  \u00a0 How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.\nAdvancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I\u2019d never done before.\u00a0 So we went on a two-hour llama hike.\u00a0 When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son\u2019s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama\u2019s personality.\u00a0 As we continued to walk, my son\u2019s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.\u00a0 And that\u2019s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone\u2014according to the llama outfitter\u2019s Google reviews\u2014have such a great experience?\nQuestion:who trained LLaMA?\nAnswer:"

The audience \u2014 including his \u201cTemple of Doom\u201d director, Steven Spielberg \u2014 gave Quan a standing ovation as he fought back tears.  \u201cMom, I just won an Oscar!\u201d said Quan, 51, whose family fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child.  \u201cThey say stories like this only happen in the movies. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d said Quan. \u201cThis is the American dream.\u201d  Minutes later, Quan\u2019s castmate Jamie Lee Curtis won for best supporting actress. Her win, in one of the most competitive categories this year, denied a victory for comic-book fans. Angela Bassett (\u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d) would have been the first performer to win an Oscar for a Marvel movie.

Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4\u00a0million; this was followed by Elvis ($151\u00a0million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70\u00a0million), The Fabelmans ($15\u00a0million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9\u00a0million), Tar ($5.6\u00a0million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2\u00a0million), and Women Talking ($1.1\u00a0million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]\nOne of the things I realized growing up is that one of the best things we can do for each other is shelter each other from the chaos of this crazy world.

But this could be one of those years in which one film dominates the night. If you\u2019re looking for an overarching theme from tonight\u2019s Academy Awards, Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019 best supporting actress win portends a big one: This is already gearing up to be an enormous night for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

It\u2019s the third Oscar for del Toro, who won twice for The Shape of Water in 2018. The film, which expands on the classic story to include deeper references to grief and fascism, had performed well across this awards season and bested a field rounded out by Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, The Sea Beast and Turning Red.\nBy Linda Holmes Of the 20 nominees in acting categories this year, 16 are first-timers.

By Bob Mondello No matter who takes home the gold statuettes tonight, 2023 will be remembered as a watershed year for Asian actors at the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them \u2013 Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and Stephanie Hsu (best supporting actress) \u2013 play the laundromat-owning multiverse-hopping family in Everything Everywhere All at Once.

While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year\u2019s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy.

But in the end, the latter took home seven titles to All Quiet's four \u2014 if that's not a sweep, we're not sure what is.  Here's the seven new titles for Everything Everywhere All at Once: The film fell short in costume design, original score and best song.\u27a1\ufe0fLooking for a full list of winners? Head here.

While it doesn't have as many channels as some of the other services (mainly Sling TV, which has more options, and DirecTV Stream, which has a slew of more expensive plans), it's good value, with local TV channels available via streaming and free, unlimited cloud-based DVR (record as much as you want and watch at your leisure).

One of the few streaming services in the United States to still offer one, YouTube TV has a free trial period that lets you test the service before you pay. The YouTube TV Base Plan usually has a seven-day free trial period, which should be more than enough time to make sure that it's something you want to pay for. But the lengths of trial periods can vary. Free trials for add-on networks have separate sign-up and billing.\nIf you're not sure if YouTube TV is for you, we suggest checking out our review on fuboTV, our number one pick for live TV streaming services.\u00a0 Need more robust internet for streaming?

Mr. Cocks currently serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of Hasbro\u2019s Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming division, a global leader in tabletop and digital gaming.

The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk\u2019s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating \u201cit seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.\u201d The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the \u201cX\u201d label he\u2019s applied to his vision of an \u201ceverything app.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks with presenter Xenia Wicket at the Offshore Northern Seas 2022 (ONS) ...

Musk is listed as the director of the company and Jared Birchall, widely considered to be Musk\u2019s right-hand man behind the scenes, is listed as the company\u2019s secretary. Musk publicly called for a six-month pause in the development of artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Musk from going full steam ahead in developing his own AI. Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015 but left the company after a power struggle in 2018. Musk has made some big hires from the world of artificial intelligence lately, including Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss, according to a reporter earlier this week from Insider. Babuschkin was hired away from DeepMind, the AI arm of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It was assumed last month that Musk was going to work on AI under the umbrella of Twitter, a company he purchased in October 2022, but it\u2019s now clear he wants to develop AI with this new independent company in Nevada.

The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC Network. It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday: \u00a01. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue\u00a0to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells\u00a0executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.\nVirginia Tech coach Brent Pry reacts after a West Virginia touchdown, as Chamarri Conner (25) returns to the sideline during the second half of an NCAA college football game Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022, in Blacksburg, Va.

The game will be broadcasted on ACCNX. The Hokies finished 2022 with an overall record of 3-8, going 1-6 in conference play. Heading into his second year at the helm, head coach Brent Pry added seven new mid-year transfers and signed the ACC\u2019s sixth-best recruiting class. Former Springfield Central QB Will Watson III will make his collegiate debut in front of fans during the game.

BLACKSBURG \u2014 Once last year\u2019s football season came to an end, Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said the plan in his second year with the Hokies was to upgrade the talent level in the offensive skill positions. Saturday\u2019s spring football game at Lane Stadium was the first time Virginia Tech\u2019s fans got a good glimpse of where things are at in that category. And while some of those new faces may not have been in the spotlight, their impact was evident in what the Hokies were getting out of some of their returning wide receivers and running backs. There was progress, Pry said, although most of that was only seen on the Maroon side of the football.\nFiled under: It\u2019s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game.  There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He\u2019d remain there for the first half.   We\u2019ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.  We\u2019ll take that as a major plus, for now.\n9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the first-team offensive line. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the one area that we had to improve in,\u201d Pry said. \u201cWe have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we\u2019re getting better there. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We\u2019ve got some old heads at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able to get some movement on them guys. So it\u2019s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line\u2019s improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what\u2019s happening in that room. Still got a ways to go.\u201d      \u00a0  Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb\u2019s didn\u2019t get a chance to run with 1\u2019s/maroon at least for a series\u2026 kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo\u2026.I didn\u2019t get to watch the game.

Apple said on Tuesday it plans to open Apple BKC in Mumbai on April 18 and Apple Saket in Delhi on April 20. The iPhone-maker\u2019s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple\u2019s expansion efforts. Despite being the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250. While India accounts for a small portion of Apple\u2019s overall revenue, the iPhone-maker has expressed optimism about the nation\u2019s potential for growth. Apple said that the new retail locations \u201cmark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.\u201d In preparation for the store openings, Apple has been actively recruiting employees in recent months, according to growing job postings. The company, which launched its Indian online store in 2020, had initially planned to open its first retail location in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a delay. Apple is also working to turn India into a key global hardware manufacturing hub, thanks in part to the incentives New Delhi is offering to manufacturers to expand their presence in the country.\nThese new retail locations mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers. To celebrate the opening of the new Apple BKC store,\u00a0Apple has created special wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The company is also promoting a special\u00a0Apple Music playlist featuring \u201csounds of Mumbai.\u201d There are also wallpapers and a unique playlist to promote the new Apple Saket store in New Delhi. Last month,\u00a0Apple opened a new retail store in South Korea\u2019s Gangnam District with a unique glass facade. A report from the\u00a0Economic Times\u00a0suggests that some Apple executives including retail chief Deirdre O\u2019Brien will be there for the grand opening. It won\u2019t be a surprise if other Apple executives like CEO Tim Cook will be at the opening day of the first Apple Store in India. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news: Apple operates more than 500 retail stores acros\u2026 Filipe Esp\u00f3sito is a Brazilian tech Journalist who started covering Apple news on iHelp BR with some exclusive scoops \u2014 including the reveal of the new Apple Watch Series 5 models in titanium and ceramic. He joined 9to5Mac to share even more tech news around the world.\nMr Roy says that Apple's decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It's not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.\nThe Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1\u00a0billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16\u00a0billion globally in 2011.\nThe company has more than 70 highly skilled retail team members at Apple Saket Store, who come from a combined 18 states in India and collectively speak more than 15 languages.

In Prima Facie, written by Suzie Miller and directed by Justin Martin, Comer plays Tessa, a young, ambitious lawyer who defends individuals accused of sexual assault and then goes through the legal system herself as a victim of rape. While accepting her Tony Award on stage, Comer acknowledged the responsibility she feels in taking on the role.\u00a0  \t\u201cTo every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been the greatest honor and it continues to be,\u201d she said.  \tThe play marks Comer\u2019s Broadway debut. The Killing Eve actress played the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience.\u00a0  \t\u201cI feel like I have so much more trust within myself and who I am. I realized that I was quite fearful last year of a lot of things, especially in my ability to do this.\nAnd I think that actually, through this experience, I\u2019ve been able to transform that into a sense of trust, which is a really nice feeling,\u201d she said.\u00a0  \tThe Broadway production is lead produced by James Bierman of Empire Street Productions. Bierman noted the production was able to recoup while also offering lower-priced tickets, including $10 lottery tickets and $45 rush tickets throughout the run.  \t           \t\u201cBringing Prima Facie to Broadway has been a journey of responsibility and faith that has been met with a response that we only dared to dream of when we set out. Suzie Miller\u2019s urgent play, Justin Martin\u2019s forensic direction, and our design team\u2019s visceral production have been the backdrop for Jodie Comer\u2019s extraordinary performance as Tessa Ensler, and the way that audiences have embraced all of this has been truly humbling,\u201d Bierman said.\u00a0  \tA film adaptation of Prima Facie is in the works, with Cynthia Erivo set to star and executive produce.

Why would we cast a Russian actor in a story, a British story?' And they went, 'She's not Russian. She's British. She's from Liverpool!' And so, her and I laugh about that quite often now. I think, 'You know, you did such a good job, you nearly did yourself out of this job!'\" In \"Prima Facie,\" Comer plays Tessa Ensler, a young, scrappy British barrister from a working-class background who has no problem defending male sex offenders \u2026 that is, until she herself is assaulted by one of her male colleagues.\u00a0 When Comer's character goes to court and tries to explain why she didn't fight off her attacker, many in the audience seem to relate, and audibly sob.  Miller said she wasn't expecting the audience's tears, which have happened at every performance. Miller, who worked as a human rights lawyer in Australia, and still lives there, said she wrote \"Prima Facie\" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. \"The statistics speak for themselves,\" Miller said. \"One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault. Out of those, I think it's one in 10 that go to court. And out of those, there's a 1.3% conviction rate.\nBy\u00a0         Megan Lim       ,\u00a0         Courtney Dorning       ,\u00a0         Juana Summers       NPR's Juana Summers talks with actress Jodie Comer about the Broadway premiere of her play Prima Facie. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Jodie Comer - American audiences probably know her as Villanelle, the beautiful, chameleon-like assassin on \"Killing Eve\"...(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"KILLING EVE\")JODIE COMER: (As Villainelle) I did my first ever kill in this country here - strangled a high-ranking police officer. He was a tango champion.SUMMERS: ...Or as Millie and her avatar Molotov Girl in the movie \"Free Guy.\" Now Comer is also a Tony Award winner. She won best actress at last night's ceremony for \"Prima Facie.\" The one-woman show is in the final weeks of a Broadway run after selling out in London's West End last year. It is the story of Tessa, a lawyer who successfully represents men accused of sexual assault.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMER: (As Tessa) The only way the system works is because we all play our roles. My role is defense. The prosecutor prosecutes. We each tell a story, and the jury decide which story is the one they believe. They take the responsibility.\nI mean, that's astonishing when you think about it.\" \"Prima Facie\" is a demanding, draining one-woman show. Comer is alone on the stage for more than an hour-and-a-half.  Moriarty asked Comer, \"This is your first time on Broadway, first time on a London stage \u2013 and you pick this play?\"  \"How do you not?\" Comer replied. \"I was like, 'I have no idea how I'm going to execute this or how I'm gonna get to a place of being confident and comfortable enough to do this, never mind, like, once, but, like, eight shows a week.' But I was so excited by that journey. Like, if I didn't take this, another actress is going to, and I'm gonna hate myself for the rest of my life!\" Comer had to research the part of a barrister, which is the British equivalent of an American trial lawyer. But she had no trouble playing a scrappy young woman from Liverpool (a blue-collar town north of London) who defies expectations. Liverpool is where Comer also grew up. \"I'm definitely scrappy,\" she laughed. \"Yeah, there's a lot of me in her, for sure.\" Comer said her parents and younger brother never doubted she'd succeed as a professional actor, even without formal training. \"They were just, like, if you're gonna commit, commit.\nQuestion:Who is the lead actress in Prima Facie?\nAnswer:"

He fired up Hinge, his preferred dating app, and swiped on a few interesting women. After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. \u201cThere\u2019s some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting started on a term paper.\u201d Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting opportunity to connect with someone new. Additionally, the world is becoming more automated: Email messages auto-complete, subscription services auto-renew, and any product under the sun is a single click away.\nWe've officially entered a new circle of online dating hell. Meet Rizz, which according to its App Store profile is an AI-powered \"dating assistant\" that tells Tinder, Hinge, and otherwise dating app users what to say to their online matches. It connects directly to a user's keyboard for easy access, and once installed, all you really have to do is start swiping right \u2014 then, from there, just let the bot dictate your every word. Cool. We hate it here. \"There's some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message,\" Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor and Rizz user, told The Washington Post. \"It's like getting started on a term paper.\" And Rizz isn't the only app like this out there. As WaPo notes, a few other apps, including one called YourMove.ai, are currently on the market, while a number of dating app scoundrels have taken to the internet in recent months to tout the supposed dating app prowess of ChatGPT. \"This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,\" YourMove.ai founder Dmitri Mirakyan told WaPo. \"So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month later, I built the first version [of the platform].\nMirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social cues \u2014 a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. \"There's such a gap currently,\" he told the newspaper, \"in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across.\" That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims\u00a0\u2014 and as humans, maybe we should shoot a little higher.

Some of the aspects didn\u2019t fit me, but it felt nice and conversational. Eventually, I asked for a more personalized version, and that one was a little bit better. I cut out the guitar strummer part because I don\u2019t play guitar.\u201d Your Move also recently rolled out a feature that helps generate the perfect dating app profile. Slate writer Heather Tal Murphy also turned to ChatGPT to land dates for a friend on the dating apps Tinder and Bumble. \u201cChatGPT encouraged an odd strain of forwardness that was helpful in getting the dates set up quickly,\u201d Tal Murphy wrote. are you not impressed? because I am https://t.co/uWLchKL432 pic.twitter.com/7fHtYWEEDq Suman Kanuganti, the founder of Personal.\n\u201d Green said she tweaked some suggested messages to show her own personality, but the AI brought out a side of her that she usually does not show. Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology\u2019s ability to foster deeper human connection. \u201cIt\u2019s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I\u2019m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.\u201d None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. \u201cIt\u2019s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember when people didn\u2019t want to share that they met on a dating app? That\u2019s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.\nQuestion:What is the name of the AI dating tool Coyne Lloyd used?\nAnswer:"

The role has been vacant since Earnie Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job \u2014 which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said \u2014 into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said. This will, in turn, allow the sporting director to work almost exclusively on the elite player pathway and the environments and structures surrounding U.S. Soccer's 27 national teams \u2014 from the USMNT and USWNT all the way on down to youth teams and what U.S.\nThe United States Soccer Federation is searching for a new sporting director to oversee its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams following the sudden and unexpected departure of Earnie Stewart, who had held the job since 2019. U.S. Soccer announced Thursday that Stewart will leave his post on Feb. 15 to take on a similar role with club side PSV Eindhoven in his native Netherlands.\u00a0 The USSF also confirmed reports by FOX Sports and others that men\u2019s national team general manager Brian McBride is out, too. The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride?\u00a0\u00a0 On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride\u2019s position might not be filled at all.\u00a0 \"We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men\u2019s] GM role,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to make.\" When it comes to Stewart\u2019s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.\nU.S, Soccer has announced the hiring of Matt Crocker as the federation\u2019s new sporting director. The 48-year-old will replace Earnie Stewart, who left U.S. Soccer in January to take a role with Dutch power PSV. Crocker joins from Southampton, where he is currently serving as the club\u2019s director of football operations. Prior to that, he spent seven years as the head of England\u2019s youth international teams for both men and women. \u201cI\u2019m really honored and excited to join U.S. Soccer as sporting director,\u201d Crocker told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe immediate focus is supporting where I can the women\u2019s World Cup team as they get ready for Australia and New Zealand\u2026 Leading the search for the next men\u2019s coach is an opportunity I\u2019m excited about.\u201d Per U.S. Soccer, Crocker will not start on a full-time basis until August 2 (which is to say, one day after the U.S. women\u2019s national team finishes its group stage slate at the World Cup), but \u201cwill immediately begin the process of hiring the head coach of the Men\u2019s National Team and supporting the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team general manager Kate Markgraf and USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski.\u201d Crocker\u2019s first, and arguably biggest task in his new job will be hiring a permanent U.S. men\u2019s national team head coach ahead of a home World Cup in 2026.\n57  Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving U.S. Soccer and will return to the Netherlands to join Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, the federation announced Thursday. Additionally, U.S. men\u2019s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here\u2019s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT\u2019s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team\u2019s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That\u2019s a daunting position, but it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Advertisement \u201cI know this moment feels a bit uncertain,\u201d USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone said on Thursday, \u201cbut what it actually is is a clean canvas.\u201d U.S. Soccer CEO J.T.\nJeff Carlisle joins Futbol Americas to discuss the reported appointment of Matt Crocker as USMNT sporting director. (1:57) British football executive Matt Crocker was hired Tuesday as sporting director of the U.S. Soccer Federation and will lead the search for the United States men's national team coach, a job that has been uncertain since Gregg Berhalter was pushed aside during an investigation that developed from a feud with the Reyna family. Crocker will start the job on Aug. 2 but will begin the coach search process immediately, the USSF said. - Stream on ESPN+: FA Cup, LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) In introducing Crocker, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone said he, \"brings a wealth of knowledge having worked at various roles and at various levels of our game. He will set the sporting vision for U.S. soccer and implement the technical plan for the women's men's extended and youth national teams.\" Crocker will also be providing support for the USWNT during the World Cup prior to his start date.

I wrote the first draft when I was in my early 20s, and I was just trying to get it made. It was only in the last couple years that we've found the right partners to make it with. So it's been a long road, but I got to make the feature film of my dreams. I feel like I'm kind of the most ready I've ever been to make it.  Actor Priya Kansara and director Nida Manzoor on the set of Polite Society. I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience.\nManzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. \"It made me believe that our stories are worth being told,\" Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almod\u00f3var. \"He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\" Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. \"Each of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I gravitate to,\" she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane Austen's works have always resonated with her. \"There's something in the way she explores the pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own,\" she says.\u00a0 Polite Society is in theaters now.\nLena subdues Salim while Ria finally masters a reverse spinning kick to defeat Raheela, and the police arrive as the sisters drive off. Reconciling with Lena, Ria finally receives an encouraging email from Eunice, and the sisters celebrate together.  In January 2022 it was revealed a feminist action comedy focusing on two British-Pakistani sisters was being filmed in London by Nida Manzoor with Working Title, Focus Features and Parkville Pictures, with a tone and voice similar to Manzoor\u2019s breakthrough and BAFTA, Peabody, and Rose d'Or award winning sitcom series We Are Lady Parts.[5]  In February 2022 it was announced that filming had wrapped on the project in London. It is produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner for Working Title with Olivier Kaempfer and John Pocock for Parkville Pictures. Focus Features had distribution rights.[2][6][7]  The typography & graphic design for the title card, credits, chapter headings and fight sequence introductions was designed by Peter Anderson Studio.[8]  Polite Society was released at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2023,[9] at the 2023 Glasgow Film Festival on 12 March 2023,[10] and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 28 April 2023.[11][12]\nShe\u2019s from the indie cinema space, and we wanted that. I wanted her to stay true to herself as a DP. She loves to go handheld. She loves it to feel a little bit bursting at the seams. There\u2019s a wildness and a freedom to the way she shoots. It was just a thrill to get to work with her. Prepping with Ashley is the most fun ever; we just swap film references, watch lots of films, and constantly remind each other of the films that are inspiring us as we shoot. We\u2019re like, \u201c70\u2019s Scorsese! It can be a bit out of focus.\u201d We were looking at Park Chan-wook\u2019s movies, his Vengeance Trilogy being both stylized but also fizzing. It\u2019s not overly stylized, there\u2019s a vibrancy of movement within the frame, and we wanted to bring that to it. It was just constantly back and forth, sharing references, and having a really great time. \u00a0 Polite Society\u00a0is playing in theaters nationwide.\nEven as Lena and Salim\u2019s courtship appears headed to the altar, Salim is still creepily tied to the apron strings of his mysterious mother, Raheela (Nimra Bucha). It\u2019s a good thing Ria has the loyal, all-in support of her besties Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) and Clara (Seraphina Beh), who have her back no matter how crazy things get.\u00a0 As the story unfolds, audiences are treated to extravagant fight scenes, tight action sequences, and a showstopping Bollywood dance number, all filtered through the experience of one girl coming of age. As such, the script doesn\u2019t shy away from female rage and issues around identity, making the film a unique delight for viewers who\u2019ve rarely seen themselves reflected onscreen.  Manzoor discussed\u00a0Polite Society\u00a0with\u00a0The Credits, pointing to her influences and revealing how her collaborations were integral to making this unusual genre-bending film successful on so many levels.\u00a0 \u00a0 Polite Society\u00a0is a love note to your favorite genre movies growing up. Some films mentioned as inspiration are\u00a0Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,\u00a0The Matrix, and the Bollywood classic,\u00a0Devdas.

After 10 hilarious and wine-filled episodes with the gang,\u00a0Grand Crew\u00a0Season 2 officially came to an end on April 28 with Episode 9's\u00a0\"Wine & Journals\" and Episode 10's \"Wine & Tastings.\"\u00a0 Watch Grand Crew\u00a0on NBC and\u00a0Peacock.\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of the characters were left with some pretty major cliffhangers that could mean big changes in the future \u2014 so what exactly happened? Keep reading on for an official recap of the\u00a0Grand Crew\u00a0Season 2 finale. In \"Wine & Journals,\" we learned that following the directive of his therapist, Noah (Echo Kellum) began keeping a personal journal. And by the finale, he tells Sherm (Carl Tart) that it's begun to turn into a screenplay rather than a typical diary. At the end of the episode, we see that he's printed it out with the title,\u00a0A Hopeless Romantic...and the Friends That Gave Him Hope. Could Noah be on the road to getting a book deal and becoming a published author? Towards the end of the season Wyatt (Justin Cunningham) and Kristen (Maya Lynn Robinson) took in his young niece-cousin, Nadine, when her mother was going through a hard time.\nI am not shy about my love for NBC\u2019s sleeper hit hangout sitcom, Grand Crew. Since it premiered within a week of Abbott Elementary in December of 2021, it\u2019s the show I\u2019ve been telling everyone and their cousin to catch up on once they\u2019re up to date with Janine and her fellow Philly teachers. I\u2019ve even gone long on it here in Paste\u2019s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series\u2019 press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn\u2019t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew\u2019s now Fay-less Season 3 future\u2014or even if, indeed, it\u2019s likely to see such a future\u2014it was nevertheless a delight. Enjoy the conversation, and then get back to streaming Season 2! The world deserves as much Grand Crew as Jackson (and NBC) are willing to make.\u00a0 Note: The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Paste Magazine: So I am really loving Season 2.\u00a0 Phil Augusta Jackson: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.\nIt\u2019s currently on a hiatus and it\u2019s also hard to say when the new season will come back to the NBC as the premiere date hasn\u2019t even yet been confirmed yet online. We\u2019re hopeful that Grand Crew\u00a0season 2 is currently shooting and the premiere date will be sometime in early 2023. Its regular time slot is 8:30\u00a0p.m. EST on Tuesdays. The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn\u2019t a drastic last-minute change to the 2022-2023 lineup. Other shows to watch out for include American Auto, Young Rock, Quantam Leap, La Brea, and New Amsterdam. And for those of you who haven\u2019t met the crew yet, what are you waiting for?

On Thursday 9 May, in Gold Coast, Australia, the Mayor of Chengdu, Mr Luo Qiang, signed the Organiser Agreement for the 12th edition of the multi-sports event.  The Vice President of IOC and the Chinese Olympic Committee, Mr Yu Zaiqing, signed the agreement as Witness. President Jose Perurena\u00a0 signed on behalf of the International World Games Association. This was preceded by ratification of the contract by the 37 member federations of the IWGA during the Annual General Meeting at the SportAccord Convention in Gold Coast. Chengdu follows the city of Birmingham, Alabama as host. The 11th edition of The World Games will take place there from 15 to 25 July 2021.  Jose Perurena said at a press briefing afterwards: \u201cBy signing a contract with one of the most forward-looking and dynamic cities in China, we have signalled our arrival as a major power in international sport.\u201d The IWGA President added: \u201dFollowing our 2021 event in another great country, the USA, we are excited now to start work with our Chinese partners on plans for 2025.\u201d  Chengdu Mayor, Mr Luo Qiang, said: \"Chengdu highly appreciates the concept of the IWGA and believe that it is in line with Chengdu's development philosophy.\nWe are confident that, under the guidance of the IWGA and the support from the Chinese Olympic Committee and governments of all levels, Chengdu can offer the world a successful and excellent World Games, a precious legacy to Chengdu and The World Games.\" The AGM unanimously ratified the decision of the Executive Committee taken the previous day to award The World Games 2025 to Chengdu. This followed a comprehensive bid evaluation, conducted by the IWGA CEO Joachim Gossow, and Vice President Max Bishop,\u00a0 including an on-site visit in March 2019. .  The delegates were given a first impression of the city and what it can offer as host of a multi-sport event by the delegation of the future host with an impressive presentation. Chengdu, a city with 20 million inhabitants and the capital of Sichuan province, is organising several multi-sports events, such as the World Police and Fire Games,\u00a0 and FISU Summer Universiade, in the next few years. \u00a0The World Games is a multi-sport event staged every four years by the International World Games Association under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee. The 11th edition of The World Games will be held in Birmingham, Alabama, USA, 15-25 July 2021. 3,600 athletes from over 30 sports and 100 countries will take part in the Games.\nFurthermore, it will be the first World Cup to boast 48 qualified teams following FIFA's vote in 2017 to expand the field from 32 sides, which had been the standard since France 1998. In this new format, 16 groups of three teams will compete with the top two teams from each group advancing to a Round of 32, which will be single elimination all the way through to the final. All in all, 80 matches will be spread across the 20 venues, with the U.S. hosting 60 games -- including the quarterfinals, semifinals and final -- and Mexico/Canada each taking 10 matches. The venues are divided into three regions: EAST, CENTRAL and WEST and were announced in New York City on Thursday. Here's everything you need to know about the chosen venues.  Jump to: Venues in the U.S. | Venues in Mexico | Venues in Canada There are 11 host cities in the United States for 2026, responsible for hosting 60 games including the quarterfinals, semifinals and final: Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium were all chosen to represent the WEST region. In the CENTRAL region, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and Kansas City were all selected. In the EAST, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia and Miami completed the U.S. contingent of cities for the 2026 World Cup. The U.S.\nAfter months of anticipation and years of preparation, we finally have our 16 host cities and venues for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The major takeaways: 11 U.S. cities were selected from the candidate pool, with three cities in Mexico and two Canadian cities joining the fray as well. The List: United States: New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Seattle, San Francisco/Bay Area and Los Angeles Canada: Vancouver, Toronto Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey The tournament was awarded to the North American and CONCACAF rivals four years ago, fending off a strong bid from Morocco, and will be a notable competition for several reasons. It will be the first World Cup hosted by more than one nation since 2002, when Japan and South Korea shared the honors, and it'll be the first World Cup with three hosts. Mexico will make history as the first nation to host or co-host for a third time (following 1970 and 1986), the U.S. will be second-time hosts (following 1994), and it will be Canada's first time hosting the men's tournament, having been the site of the Women's World Cup in 2015.\nFor example, the Bullfight Ring, which was the venue for dancesport, was 'packed' for the salsa dance finals.[16]  This edition of the Games saw the first time a competition was cancelled: due to concerns about temperature and air flow at the Del Pueblo Gymnasium, where the sport of rhythmic gymnastics was taking place, the ribbons event was cancelled.[17]  The 2017 Games in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland were the first to be broadcast on the Olympic Channel, to 130 countries. Both the raffa and lyonnaise disciplines of boules were cancelled after a storm destroyed the venue and it could not be repaired in time.[18]  In 2015, it was announced that the 11th edition of The World Games was to be held in Birmingham, Alabama, USA in 2021, beating bids from Lima, Peru and Ufa, Russia.[19] On 2 April 2020, the Games were postponed to 2022 so as not to clash with the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo due to the coronavirus pandemic.[20][21][22]  No parasport federations are currently part of the IWGA, but The World Games in Birmingham was the first edition to include parasports, with the inclusion of wheelchair rugby. Birmingham was also to include disabled athletes (one per gender) in archery.\nQuestion:Which city will host The World Games 2025?\nAnswer:"

TCW boasts more than $200 billion in assets under management, so Koch's views hold a lot of gravitas. \"We're really looking, at TCW, for a macroeconomic environment that's going to be pretty challenging,\" Koch said. \"And so we're in the camp of having a medium to hard [economic] landing. What I would say is that I don't think the rest of the sentiment has caught up to that view.\" The economic challenges look to be piling up. PacWest (PACW) stock crashed by 50% in early trading on Thursday. The plunge in the West Coast regional bank comes as it said it was weighing a range of strategic options, including a sale or capital raise. Extreme selling pressure has spread to other regional banks this week, including Comerica (CMA) and Zions (ZION). The week began with regulators seizing regional bank First Republic (FRC). JPMorgan (JPM) then swooped in to purchase a majority of First Republic's assets.\nKathryn Koch was named president and CEO of TCW Group, a news release said Tuesday.  Ms. Koch, who will join the manager in the coming months, was previously CIO of the public equity business at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. She will succeed David Lippman, who is retiring from the firm when his contract expires at the end of 2022. In August 2021, sources said he was expected to leave when the impending departure of Tad Rivelle, CIO of fixed income, was announced. Mr. Lippman has been CEO of TCW Group since 2012. A TCW Group spokesman said in an email that Ms. Koch was selected for \"her broad experience in domestic and international business development and strategic planning.\" GSAM announced Ms. Koch's departure in a statement on Tuesday emailed by a spokeswoman.

LOS ANGELES \u2013 September 6, 2022 \u2013 The TCW Group, a global independent asset management firm, today announced the appointment of Kathryn (Katie) Koch as President and Chief Executive Officer. In this role, Koch will be responsible for all aspects of the leadership and management of TCW, including leading TCW\u2019s teams around the world, delivering investment excellence for clients, and driving the Firm\u2019s continued growth trajectory.\u00a0 Koch, 42, joins TCW after 20 years with Goldman Sachs in the Asset Management Division (AMD), where she was a Partner and most recently served as Chief Investment Officer of the $300 billion Public Equity business and as a member of the AMD executive committee. Previously, she was based in London for 10 years where she held several leadership roles including Head of the Multi-Asset Solutions business internationally.\u00a0 \u201cKatie is an incredibly impressive executive with deep experience in asset management and a demonstrated track record of building exceptional investment cultures and innovating to drive growth,\u201d said Marc I. Stern, Chairman of the TCW Board of Directors.\n\u201cI am energized to work with the TCW team globally to deliver for our clients and drive the next phase of our growth.\u201d Koch will succeed current President and CEO David Lippman, who, as planned and previously reported, will retire from TCW at the end of 2022. Lippman joined TCW in 2009 with TCW\u2019s acquisition of MetWest Asset Management and assumed the role of CEO in 2012.\u00a0 During his tenure, TCW\u2019s business has experienced strong growth in assets under management, product offerings, and geographic reach.\u00a0 \u201cFor the past decade, David has adeptly steered TCW through one of the most successful periods of the firm\u2019s long history,\u201d Stern continued. \u201cHe has been an incredible leader and we are deeply thankful for everything he has done for TCW, our clients, and our employees during his tenure. We wish him all the best in his retirement.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 TCW anticipates Koch to assume the role in the coming months following an orderly transition and will be based in TCW\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters.\u00a0 \u201cIt has been an incredible honor to lead TCW these past ten years, and I am proud of everything we achieved for our clients and the TCW team,\u201d said Lippman. \u201cI am delighted that Katie will be my successor.\nAs a result of the purchase, ownership by TCW management and employees increased to 44%, while Carlyle maintains a 31% interest in the firm.

                "value": "The Google Fold phone is the first entry to the US folding phone market after Samsung After years of rumors, Google finally unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023, its first folding phone that goes head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case. The phone is available in a dark Obsidian and a light Porcelain colorway.\nThe Pixel Fold is available for pre-order from today (May 10), with general sales in June. Incredibly, as of late May, the top 512GB Pixel Fold model is already sold out in the US. If you pre-order the Pixel Fold, Google will also toss in a free Pixel Watch, although this promotion is limited to Germany, the UK, and the US (leaving Japan in the lurch). Otherwise, everyone also gets a 2TB Google One plan for six months and a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium. There\u2019s also a trade-in program for those who want to switch their current handset for the foldable. Google accepts products from Apple, LG, Motorola, OnePlus, and Samsung, and the trade-in\u2019s value differs between the various models. Notably, you can also trade in Google Pixels. For instance, the 128GB Pixel 7 Pro will get you $380 off the Fold\u2019s price. Visit Google\u2019s trade-in portal for the full list of products and offers. The Pixel Fold hasn\u2019t made its mass market debut yet, so you won\u2019t find expert reviews of the foldable. However, based on our experience with the device at Google I/O 2023, the Pixel Fold should do more than enough to challenge the likes of Samsung in this space. In his hands-on preview, C. Scott Brown \u201ccame away impressed\u201d by the Pixel Fold. \u201cIt felt great. It looked great.\nThe Google Pixel Fold was in the rumor mill for more than a year, without Google ever acknowledging it's working on it until a few days before Google I/O 2023. With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch. Google's first foldable has arrived with a wider aspect ratio \u2014 inside and out \u2014 as well as the Tensor G2's AI finesse to help squeeze every pixel out of the cameras and every iota of productivity out of your day.

Google Pixel Fold is now available for pre-order and will begin shipping next month. Our new foldable phone combines the helpfulness of Pixel with a design that unfolds into a compact tablet, unlocking even more ways for you to use your device. And it\u2019s all powered by our Google Tensor G2 chip, which also makes Pixel Fold fast and secure. Here\u2019s a look at the newest addition to our Pixel portfolio. When closed, Pixel Fold has a familiar smartphone silhouette that fits in the palm of your hand and slides into your pocket. Flip it open to reveal a 7.6-inch screen with a thinner profile than any other foldable phone in the market.1 To create this foldable design, we didn\u2019t compromise on form and function. Many of the Pixel components \u2014 from camera, battery, speakers and haptics technology \u2014 were cleverly redesigned to fit within the thin design. Our custom-built hinge not only contributes to that thinness, but also doubles as the most durable hinge out there.2 And last but not least, Pixel Fold has an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Whether it\u2019s open or closed, the Pixel Fold\u2019s screens unlock endless ways of having fun and getting things done.\nBy  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment.

The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn\u2019t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn\u2019t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we\u2019ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It\u2019ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have \u201cthe most durable hinge on a foldable,\u201d along with a price that\u2019s over $1,700. Samsung\u2019s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799. We had expected to see it last year, but the Fold didn\u2019t make the cut for I/O in 2022, and rumors about its launch haven\u2019t slowed down in the year since.\nQuestion:When was Pixel Fold announced?\nAnswer:"

                "value": "Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google introduced a $1,799 foldable smartphone, a new entry-level Pixel phone and a tablet for the home, its latest attempt to spark hardware sales in an arena saturated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Launched at Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0Google I/O conference, the\u00a0Pixel Fold\u00a0is Google\u2019s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its\u00a02022 flagship phone\u2019s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.\u00a0 The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google\u2019s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung\u2019s latest\u00a0Galaxy Z Fold 4\u00a0and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables \u2014 with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC \u2014 having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For many watching Google's I/O developer conference this week, the big draw is a full breakdown of the company's broader AI plans. But the company hasn\u2019t just been working on software. During the conference\u2019s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets \u2014 including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display \u2014 as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren\u2019t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It\u2019s not clear what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company\u2019s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here\u2019s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.\nWhat it is: Google\u2019s first smartphone that folds in half, arriving next month How much does it cost? $1,799 to start What does it promise? A great camera and a design that means it\u2019s easier to use (or tuck into a pocket) when closed More than a quarter of smartphone owners in the United States are \u201chighly likely\u201d to upgrade to a foldable model next, according to a survey conducted by Counterpoint Research. That leaves Google \u2014 long an also-ran in the U.S. smartphone market \u2014 with an opportunity. And thankfully, the company\u2019s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn\u2019t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it\u2019s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Pixel Fold is noticeably thinner than other Samsung options, either. At last: a folding smartphone that won\u2019t feel super awkward in your back pocket. When open, the Fold\u2019s internal 7.\nApart from its folding design, Google\u2019s pricey new phone also mostly sticks to familiar territory \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen much so far that sets it apart from other Pixels and other foldables. Google may well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road \u2014 we know the company is working on an \u201cinterpreter mode\u201d for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations \u2014 but it feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google\u2019s most thoughtful software features, on a budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year\u2019s Pixel 7, kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though, this is Google\u2019s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more expensive devices offered.\n6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes \u2014 it\u2019s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big bezels around the sides of the screen don\u2019t look great, but they\u2019re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold \u2014 like the much cheaper 7a \u2014 uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company\u2019s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for \u2014 from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold\u2019s three rear cameras \u2014 may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many.

The labor market remains red hot. That's great for workers, but it's bound to reinforce concerns about high inflation. Hiring surged last month as U.S. employers added 339,000 jobs, far above expectations, according to a report from the Labor Department on Friday. The job gains for March and April were also stronger than previously reported. The April jobs figure was revised up by 41,000, while the March number was revised up by 52,000. The strong jobs numbers indicate the U.S. jobs engine continues to chug along, with substantial hiring in business services, health care and hospitality.   Construction companies added 25,000 jobs last month even as high interest rates have weighed on the housing market. The unemployment rate, which is compiled from a separate survey, paints a less rosy picture.  Unemployment, which been at a half century low, inched up in May to 3.7%.\nThe labor market showed resilience in April, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to cool the economy. More jobs were added than in recent months, across a wide range of sectors, and the unemployment rate fell. Monthly change in jobs +500,000 jobs +253,000 in April +400,000 +300,000 +200,000 +100,000 April \u201922 July Oct.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze  Lydia DePillis Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department reported Friday, in a reversal of the cooling trend that had marked the first quarter and was expected to continue. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, down from 3.5 percent in March, and matched the level in January, which was the lowest since 1969. The higher-than-forecast job gain complicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential shift toward a pause in interest rate increases. Chair Jerome H. Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank might continue to raise rates if new data showed the economy wasn\u2019t slowing enough to keep prices down.\nBLS\u00a0Revisions: The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised down by 32,000, from +504,000 to +472,000, and the change for February was revised up by 15,000, from +311,000 to +326,000. With these revisions, employment in January and February combined is 17,000 lower than previously reported. The change in temporary help services employment in January was revised up from gain of +15,300 jobs to a gain of +16,600, and the previously estimated gain of +6,800 in February was revised down to a gain of +3,400. With these revisions, temporary help services employment in February was -2,100 lower than previously reported. SIA\u2019s Perspective:\u00a0 The US economy added +236,000 jobs in March, in-line with expectations and slightly above the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, which called for a gain of +230,000. This marks the twelfth consecutive month that nonfarm payroll growth has outpaced expectations per the Bloomberg survey. This continues a decelerating trend. In 2022, average monthly payroll growth was +399,000; three months into 2023, that figure is +345,000, with March\u2019s payroll growth half of January\u2019s revised figure. Labor force participation continues to be a bright spot, increasing to 62.\nIn February, there was an average of nearly 1.7 jobs for every\u00a0unemployed\u00a0job seeker. When Biden took office, there were fewer jobs than unemployed job seekers. The number of job openings in March is set to be\u00a0released\u00a0May 2. Labor Force Participation\u00a0\u2014 One reason many job openings go unfilled is that millions of Americans left the workforce during the pandemic and haven\u2019t returned. The\u00a0labor force participation rate\u00a0(the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work) has slowly recovered during Biden\u2019s time, from 61.3% in January 2021 to 62.6% in March. That still leaves the rate well short of the pre-pandemic level of 63.3% for February 2020. The rate peaked at\u00a067.3%\u00a0more than two decades ago, during the first four months of 2000. Labor Department economists project that the rate will trend down to 60.1% in 2031, \u201cprimarily because of an aging population.\u201d Manufacturing Jobs\u00a0\u2014 During the presidential campaign, Biden\u00a0promised\u00a0he had a plan to create a million new manufacturing jobs \u2014 and whether it\u2019s his doing or not, the number is rising briskly. As of March, the U.S. added\u00a0787,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0during Biden\u2019s time, a 6.\nChecking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  Job growth fared better than expected in April despite bank turmoil and a decelerating economy, the Labor Department reported Friday.

The unemployment rate was 3.4% against an estimate for 3.6% and tied for the lowest level since 1969. A more encompassing number that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged lower to 6.6%. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation barometer, rose 0.5% for the month, more than the 0.3% estimate and the biggest monthly gain in a year.\nQuestion:How many jobs were created in April 2023?\nAnswer:"

The United States has mobilized and sustained a historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic \u2013 with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency\u2019s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice.\u00a0The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and community public health actions to protect those at highest risk of severe COVID-19. Our priority remains providing the information necessary to protect the nation\u2019s public health. Most tools, like vaccines, treatments, and testing, will remain available. But, some tools, like certain data sources and reporting, will change.  Access to COVID-19 vaccines will generally not be affected for now. The U.S. government is currently distributing free COVID-19 vaccines for all adults and children.\nOctober 13, 2022 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must renew the federal public health emergency (PHE) related to COVID-19 every 90 days to maintain certain health care flexibilities and waivers. The PHE has been in place since January 27, 2020, and renewed throughout the pandemic. The latest HHS extension for the PHE is effective through January 11, 2023. In a letter to the state Governors, the Administration has indicated they will give at least a 60-day notice before the PHE ends. In April, ASHA urged HHS to extend the PHE in a letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra [PDF]. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-103) provides a 151-day extension to some flexibilities, once the federal PHE ends. With this PHE renewal and the additional 151-day extension, ASHA expects certain flexibilities will continue at least into the second quarter of 2023, such as continued payment for audiology and speech-language pathology telehealth services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. With each PHE extension, numerous flexibilities and waivers remain in effect, including Medicare telehealth coverage of audiology and speech-language pathology services and relaxed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements. Clinicians should be aware that states may have different dates for ending local PHEs.\nThis fact sheet will help you know what to expect at the end of the PHE so that you can continue to feel confident in how you will receive your health care. Please note that this information is not intended to cover every possible scenario.  This fact sheet will cover the following:  The Administration, States, and private insurance plans will continue to provide guidance in the coming months. As described in previous communications, the Administration\u2019s continued response is not entirely dependent on the COVID-19 PHE. There are significant flexibilities and actions that will not be affected as we transition from the current phase of our response. For more information on what changes and does not change across the Department, visit https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/09/fact-sheet-covid-19-public-health-emergency-transition-roadmap.html.  COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and treatments Medicare Vaccines: People with Medicare coverage will continue to have access to COVID-19 vaccinations without cost sharing after the end of the PHE.  Testing: Additionally, people with traditional Medicare can continue to receive COVID-19 PCR and antigen tests with no cost sharing when the test is ordered by a physician or certain other health care providers, such as physician assistants and certain registered nurses, and performed by a laboratory.\nTo ensure an orderly transition, we have been working for months so that we can continue to meet the needs of those affected by COVID-19. Even beyond the end of the COVID-19 PHE, we will continue to work to protect Americans from the virus and its worst impacts by supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and tests, including for people without health insurance. We will continue to advance research into new, innovative vaccines and treatments through an investment of $5 billion in Project NextGen, a dedicated program to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments, including investments in research, development, and manufacturing capacity and advancing critical science. And we are continuing to invest in efforts to better understand and address Long COVID and to help mitigate the impacts. What will not be affected by the end of the COVID-19 PHE:  The Administration\u2019s continued response to COVID-19 is not fully dependent on the emergency declaration for the COVID-19 PHE, and there are significant flexibilities and actions that will not be affected when we transition from the current phase of our response on May 11. Access to COVID-19 vaccinations and certain treatments, such as Paxlovid and Lagevrio, will generally not be affected. To help keep communities safe from COVID-19, HHS remains committed to maximizing continued access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.\nThe Public Health Service Act was used to declare a\u00a0public health emergency\u00a0(PHE) in\u00a0the entire United States on January 31, 2020 giving us the flexibility to support our beneficiaries, effective January 27, 2020.\u00a0 The PHE was renewed on\u00a0April 21, 2020,\u00a0July 23, 2020,\u00a0October 2, 2020,\u00a0January 7, 2021,\u00a0\u00a0April 15, 2021,\u00a0July 19, 2021,\u00a0\u00a0October 15, 2021,\u00a0January 7, 2022,\u00a0April 12, 2022 effective April 16, 2022, July 15, 2022, October 13, 2022,\u00a0January\u00a011, 2023, and February 9, 2023.

It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.  The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1][2][3][4] (sometimes later called \"Clippy\"), after a paperclip. Clippit was the default, and by far the most notable, Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[5] The Office Assistant and particularly Clippit have been the subject of numerous criticism and parodies. In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip emoji (\ud83d\udcce) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.[6]  The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office.

He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft is announcing a new AI-powered Copilot for its Microsoft 365 apps and services today, designed to assist people with generating documents, emails, presentations, and much more. The Copilot, powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft\u2019s Copilot leaked earlier today. \u201cIt works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more,\u201d said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. \u201cCopilot is a whole new way of working.\u201d Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can also be summoned throughout Microsoft\u2019s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on other files. The AI-generated text can then be freely edited and adapted.\nIt was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit[1]), after a paperclip.[7][8]  The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob[9] and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.[3] From Office 2000 onward, Microsoft Agent (.acs) replaced the Microsoft Bob-descended Actor (.act) format as the technology supporting the feature. Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in System32 folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout & Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine allowed the Office Assistant to accept speech input.[10]\nIn Office 2000, the Hoverbot, Scribble, and Power Pup assistants were replaced by F1 (a robot), Links (a cat), and Rocky (a dog). The Clippit and Office Logo assistants were also redesigned. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons.  The Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, Saeko Sensei (\u51b4\u5b50\u5148\u751f), an animated secretary, and a version of the Monkey King (Chinese: \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.[19] Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the dolphin in Japanese.  Since their introduction, more assistants have been released and have been exclusively available via download.[20][1]  The 12 assistants for Office 97 could be downloaded from the Microsoft website.[22]  The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.[23][24] Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP, acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.[14] The feature was removed altogether in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac, as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.   The program was widely reviled among users as intrusive and annoying,[25][26] and was criticized even within Microsoft.\nQuestion:What is the name of Microsoft's ai assistant in office?\nAnswer:"

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn\u2019t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users\u2019 libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image\u2019s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren\u2019t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject\u2019s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can\u2019t be understated.\nMasked region and Imagen Editor\u2019s results for \u201ca bouquet of red flowers,\u201d \u201ctwo trees,\u201d \u201can Imagen Editor sign,\u201d \u201ca bush with green leaves,\u201d and \u201ca bush without leaves\u201d Technically called inpainting, the process Google\u2019s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop\u2019s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that\u2019s why it won\u2019t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.\nBy  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents \u2014 and potentially, the meaning \u2014 of a photo in much more significant ways. While it\u2019s clear that this tool isn\u2019t flawless\u00a0\u2014 and there remains no firm release date for it \u2014 Google\u2019s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.\nText-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google\u2019s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google\u2019s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google\u2019s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren\u2019t satisfied with the result, you\u2019re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn\u2019t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren\u2019t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided.

It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop \u2013 and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.\u00a0 35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold \u2013 only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.\u00a0 Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?\nAnswer:"

The AI chatbot launched last November but rocketed in use. Some outside estimates suggest the app attracted 100 million users by January this year, though OpenAI has never confirmed these figures.  The app\u2019s launch is interesting, considering OpenAI\u2019s somewhat ambivalent approach to positioning ChatGPT in the market. Although the chatbot launched as an experiment, it rapidly found a consumer audience who use the bot for everything from cheating on college essays to business applications.\nThe ChatGPT app syncs your conversations, supports voice input, and brings our latest model improvements to your fingertips.

The new app gives you a way to take OpenAI's AI chatbot on the go.\u00a0 The free app works on iPhones and iPads, supports voice input and syncs your history across devices. Like using ChatGPT on a computer, the iOS app can answer questions, help with travel plans, write poems and more.\u00a0 OpenAI said people who subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month, will get faster response times, early access to features and be able to tap into GPT-4 on the iOS app. The rollout of the\u00a0iOS app\u00a0begins in the US and will expand to more countries in the coming weeks, OpenAI said. Android users will get their own version \"soon,\" the company said. OpenAI kicked off the AI rush with the release of ChatGPT in November.\u00a0GPT-4, an update to the large language model that powers the ChatGPT chatbot, was released in March.

Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone. Apple is expected to offer a more affordable model and a follow up to the higher-end and more expensive first-generation model. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \"contact lenses\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s.\nApple\u2019s headset headache: the tiny and costly displays inside the Vision Pro (Financial Times) Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro (Bloomberg) Apple Reportedly Expects To Sell Fewer Than 400,000 Vision Pro Headsets Next Year Due To Production Snags (Forbes)\nApple is planning an in-store, appointment-only rollout of its flagship virtual reality headset Vision Pro, Bloomberg reported on Friday, underscoring the complexities behind the company\u2019s most consequential product launch in years as it faces manufacturing difficulties, high costs and a struggling effort to whip up mass-market appeal for what is mostly still a niche product. The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask\u2014including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses\u2014necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.\nBy  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that \u201cseamlessly\u201d blends the real and digital world. \u201cIt\u2019s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says \u201chundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps\u201d will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they\u2019re resting low on your body.\nApple did not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment. The Vision Pro is Apple\u2019s much anticipated foray into virtual reality and its launch could be as important to the company as its other major products like the iPhone. It is billed as a mixed reality headset that blends the virtual and real world\u2014one can switch between full virtual reality and \u201caugmented\u201d reality mixing virtual and real elements\u2014and has been a poorly kept secret that has been years in the making. Investors hope it will fire up interest in the sector, which has been around for years but struggled to take off in a major way. Its high price tag puts it at the upper end of the market\u2014it is working on a cheaper model\u2014which analysts expect will limit initial demand to loyal Apple fans and wealthier customers. The headset\u2019s design and high costs of the technology it uses have reportedly forced Apple to lower its ambitions for the device\u2019s rollout to manage manufacturing difficulties. The issues have reportedly pushed the company to drop its 2024 production goal from more than 1 million units to fewer than 400,000. Apple will push Vision Pro into other markets toward the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg. The U.K. and Canada are reportedly leading candidates for the first sales outside of the U.S., though this has not been settled, with other markets in Asia and Europe to follow shortly after.\nQuestion:What is the price of the Apple Vision Pro headset?\nAnswer:"

Concept render based on purported leaked information by Ian ZelboIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, Gurman explained that there are a minimum of three Apple headsets actively in development that he is aware of, under the codes \"N301,\" \"N602,\" and \"N421.\" The first of these devices, N301, is what Gurman believes will be called \"Apple Reality Pro.\" Apple Reality Pro is said to be the company's \"high-end rival\" to Meta's upcoming Quest Pro headset. N602 is reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called. It is worth noting that the \"Reality Pro\" name lines up with Apple's recent trademark filings. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has trademarked several terms believed to be associated with its upcoming headset devices, including \"Reality Processor,\" \"Reality Pro,\" and \"Reality One.\nCUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.\nSubscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info. Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.\nThe Reality Processor would naturally refer to the custom Apple silicon designed for the device. The chip is expected to be similar to the M2 chip seen in the 2022 MacBook Air. The Information said the first-generation headset would also feature a special coprocessor to manage the imaging pipeline. Apple\u2019s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything\u2019s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release. What we do expect to see on September 7 is the iPhone 14 lineup and Apple Watch Series 8. The headset will most likely be announced in the spring of 2023.

The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform.

[Music] Murray:\u00a0Kate, let me first of all, just welcome you, thank you for being here, and get you to tell us a little bit about what Maven is and how you got started. Kate Ryder:\u00a0Thank you so much for having me. Thrilled to be here in Aspen. So I founded Maven in 2014 because I saw firsthand a lot of the gaps in the in the women\u2019s and family health care model. And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren\u2019t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we\u2019re also the richest country that spends the most on health care. And so you know, what Maven does is we really fill in all of these very distinct gaps through a virtual care and financial support platform. So we have the largest telehealth network and women\u2019s and family health.\nRyder recently told CNBC that the company saw a 67% month-over-month increase in opportunities from companies looking for\u00a0travel benefits, as well as other health-care support for pregnant women, after the SCOTUS decision. \"Because we're in the market, because we had a platform that we were able to access, we were able to jump up and step up with our products,\" Ryder said at the recent CNBC Work Summit.\u00a0 Maven Clinic has experienced a broader increase in demand for its products over the past two years amid a pandemic and tight labor market, which she attributed to the accessibility of its virtual platform as well as its outspoken support of health equity. \"The overturning of Roe v. Wade created additional inequities in a system already riddled with them, in a country where 50% of counties don't have an OB-GYN and where maternal mortality rates surpass those of all other developed countries,\" she wrote in the blog post. Maven now reaches 15 million members, a 5x increase from last year, across its 450-plus corporate clients and payers (insurance companies) in\u00a0over 175 countries, and the platform supports over 30 provider specialties in 30 provider languages. Maven Clinic was\u00a0ranked No. 19\u00a0on the 2022 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. Maven clients have included\u00a0Microsoft and L'Oreal.\nChecking Accounts Best Credit Cards for Small Business Best Small Business Loans Best Tax Software for Small Business SELECT All Taxes Best Tax Software Best Tax Software for Small Businesses Tax Refunds SELECT All Help for Low Credit Scores Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Best Credit Cards for Building Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower Best Mortgages for Bad Credit Best Hardship Loans How to Boost Your Credit Score SELECT All Investing Best IRA Accounts Best Roth IRA Accounts Best Investing Apps Best Free Stock Trading Platforms Best Robo-Advisors Index Funds Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds  Maven, the women and family health startup, has raised $90 million in a new fundraising round, and in a tough environment for venture funding. The round, led by General Catalyst and with CVS Health Ventures, Intermountain Healthcare's VC arm and European venture firm La Famiglia participating, brings Maven's total capital raised to $300 million. Maven reached unicorn status last August in a $110 million round right before the bottom dropped out of the tech sector. While the downturn in tech is forcing down rounds for some startups, Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder said in a blog post the latest deal raised its valuation, albeit slightly, to $1.35 billion. Maven has benefitted from greater focus on women's health, particularly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade.\nQuestion:Who is the CEO of Maven?\nAnswer:"

It was the first U.S. Open to be played in Los Angeles since Riviera Country Club hosted the tournament in 1948.[1]  Wyndham Clark, who had never finished better than 75th in a major championship and had missed the cut in his previous two U.S. Opens, shot a final-round 70 to finish at 10-under-par for the tournament and hold off four-time major champion Rory McIlroy by one shot for his first career U.S. Open and major championship .[2]  Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele both broke the U.S. Open scoring record by shooting 62 (\u22128) in the first round. Fowler, who was tied with Clark for the lead at the start of the final round, ended up tied for fifth place, while Schauffele finished 10th.[3]  On July 22, 2015, the United States Golf Association (USGA) announced that Los Angeles Country Club was selected to host the 123rd U.S. Open in June 2023.

(AP Photo/Matt York) LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 In the city of stars, Wyndham Clark had his own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf\u2019s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother \u2014 \u201cPlay big,\u201d she always told him \u2014 and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That\u2019s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. \u201cI feel like I belong on this stage,\u201d Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. \u201cEven two, three years ago when people didn\u2019t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.\nPlay Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Los Angeles Country Club will host a major for the first time ever when the 2023 U.S. Open begins on Thursday. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will try to continue his run of dominant play in big events, and enters as the 13-2 betting favorite in the latest 2023 U.S. Open odds from Caesars Sportsbook. He is followed on the PGA odds board by Jon Rahm (8-1), Brooks Koepka (17-2), Viktor Hovland (10-1), and Rory McIlroy (11-1). The 2023 U.S. Open field is playing for a total purse of $17.5 million that features a winner's share of $3.15 million. Defending U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick is a 35-1 longshot.

Amazon announced its first Prime Day of 2023 will take place on Tuesday, July 11, and Wednesday, July 12, confirming predictions from industry experts. Sellers had earlier been told they needed to submit their deals for the first Amazon Prime Day of 2023 by April 28th. Amazon.com Inc. is planning a second Prime Day for 2023, according to marketplace sellers who say they have been notified of an August 11 deadline to submit deals for the event. Amazon is No. 1 in the Top 1000. The database is Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of the largest North American online retailers. Amazon is also No. 3 in the Online Marketplaces database, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces. Prime Day is now Amazon\u2019s biggest sale of the year. It is usually held during the summer months. In 2022, it was July 12 and July 13. The annual two-day deals event is for Prime members only.\nIn 2022, Amazon held a second Prime Day event dubbed Prime Early Access Sale. Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon\u2019s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That\u2019s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nSome early Prime Day price drops are already on the table, with Amazon offering discounts on its own products, including Wirecutter-recommended devices like the Kindle Paperwhite Kids ebook reader and the Echo Dot Kids (5th Gen) Alexa smart speaker. From now through midnight Pacific Time on July 7, 2023, Prime members can also receive a $15 Amazon credit if they download the Amazon Photos app and upload their first photo. Originating in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon\u2019s 20th birthday, Prime Day is an Amazon Prime\u2013exclusive sales event. Prime members get access to some of the better prices available on a variety of stuff, from Amazon\u2019s own selection of smart speakers to housewares, baby gear, laptops, and clothing. There are several ways savvy shoppers can prepare for Prime Day. As in years past, Prime members can once again set up deals alerts based on previous Amazon searches and recently viewed items. Visit the Prime Day event page on the Amazon app between now and Prime Day to create a deals alert, and you\u2019ll receive push notifications when deals become available. Amazon has also rolled out a new, invite-only deals program this year, through which Prime members can request an invitation to score some (so-called) exclusive deals on items that are expected to sell out. We\u2019re waiting to see what these deals entail, but we anticipate seeing discounts on everything from robot vacuums and smart TVs  to exercise equipment and small appliances.\n12.  Now we do not yet have confirmation that Amazon will have another Early Access Sale this year. But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale \u2014 and there's no reason to think it won't \u2014 you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.  If you missed out on the latest Prime Day, fear not, because retailers likes Walmart and Target have started their own sales to rival Prime Day. And those deals are still for the taking.

The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80\u00a0percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20\u00a0percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy.\n7] The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVII held on February 12, 2023, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.  Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players\u2014Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes\u2014have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]\nGLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 For the second time of his career, Patrick Mahomes is a Super Bowl champion and Super Bowl MVP. The Chiefs quarterback was named the Super Bowl 57 MVP after he led Kansas City to a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.\u00a0He is the sixth player ever to win multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. Mahomes went 21 of 27 passing for 182 yards and three touchdowns despite playing on a ginger ankle that was reaggravated in the first half. He also added 44 rushing yards in the win. The Chiefs trailed 24-14 at halftime and rattled off 24 second-half points. Mahomes and the Chiefs scored on every possession in the second half. \u00a0Prior to Sunday, teams that trailed by at least 10 points at halftime were 1-26 in the Super Bowl, per NFL Research. Kansas City rallied back and became the second team to erase at least a 10-point deficit. Super Bowl 57 was the first time two Black quarterbacks started against each other in a Super Bowl. Appropriately, the championship game was a showcase of spectacular performances between Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. Mahomes\u2019 Super Bowl 57 MVP capped off a stellar year for the Chiefs quarterback. He led the NFL with 5,250 passing yards and 41 touchdowns in the regular season, the only quarterback to eclipse 5,000 passing yards and 40 touchdowns this year.\nAround The NFL Writer INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- The receiving king is a Super Bowl champion -- and an MVP. Cooper Kupp was named Super Bowl LVI Most Valuable Player on Sunday following the Los Angeles Rams' comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Kupp caught the game-winning touchdown pass, a reception from one yard out with 1:25 remaining in regulation to give the Rams a 23-20 lead over the Bengals after a wild sequence in which an earlier Kupp touchdown was wiped out by penalty. Teammate Aaron Donald sealed the franchise's first Super Bowl triumph since the 1999 season with a pressure of Joe Burrow on fourth down. \"Man, just so proud of this team, the way we prepared, the way we loved on each other, trusted each other,\" Kupp told NBC's Mike Tirico after the game. \"I don't know. I just don't feel deserving of this. God is just so good. I'm just so thankful for the guys I get to be around, for the coaches, for my family. I don't know what to say.\" Kupp is just the eighth wide receiver to be named Super Bowl MVP and the first since Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII.
