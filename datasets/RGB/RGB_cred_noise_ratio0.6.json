                "value": "Docs:Low credibility of text: Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.\nHigh credibility of text: Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos), who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity?                     Suggest an update.

Parents need to know that Good Sam is a medical procedural featuring a father-and-daughter heart surgeon team who hash out their familial drama as they save patients. Parents should be aware of scenes featuring simulated heart surgery and other scary topics, such as conversations about a near-fatal car accident, \"coding\" (needing to be resuscitated), and other medical lingo.\nHigh credibility of text: The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.  RELATED: 10 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.\nLow credibility of text: Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.  If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.\nLow credibility of text: At the nurses station, nurses DONNA (50s) and PAMELA (30s) are explaining to a patient how it crazy it can get here sometimes, just as SAMANTHA aka DR SAM (35) chases after MR FERGUSON, a disoriented patient who's refusing to be operated on. At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.\n\nQuestion:The genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is what?\nAnswer:"

LSU finishes the season with a 10-4 record. KEY PERFORMANCES Quarterback Jayden Daniels finished 12-of-17 for 139 yards and a touchdown. Redshirt freshman Garrett Nussmeier went 10-of-14 for 98 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Sophomore wideout Malik Nabers earned Citrus Bowl MVP, leading the receivers with nine catches for 163 yards and a touchdown. Freshman tight end Mason Taylor recorded five catches for 88 yards and a touchdown. Senior safety Greg Brooks shined on defense with five tackles, one for loss, along with an interception. KEY PLAYS Purdue won the toss and deferred to the second half.  On 1st-and-10 from the LSU 44, Daniels found Taylor for a 19-yard completion to the Purdue 44. On 4th-and-2 from the 36, the Tigers elected to go for it, and Daniels connected with Nabers for a 12-yard pickup to move the chains at the Boilermaker 24.

Here are the winners and losers of the 2022-23 bowl season — so far. This post will be updated as bowl season continues through Jan. 2. LSU: The Tigers got to 10 wins in Brian Kelly’s first season with an easy 63-7 win over Purdue on Jan. 2. The Tigers led 35-0 at halftime and were up 49-0 before Purdue finally got into the end zone. The Boilermakers entered the game without QB Aidan O’Connell, WR Charlie Jones and a host of other players, but this was a bigger blowout than anyone could have anticipated. LSU was able to play three quarterbacks and WR Malik Nabers even threw two passes — one went for a TD — in addition to having nine catches for 163 yards and a TD. LSU came up just six yards short of hitting the 600-yard mark on offense and even got a 99-yard pick six with less than a minute left. Simply put, it was a blowout. Oregon State: Oregon State destroyed Florida 30-3 in the Las Vegas Bowl to get to 10 wins for the first time since 2006. Additionally, it was the first bowl win for the Beavers since 2013.\nHigh credibility of text: Game summary of the Iowa Hawkeyes vs. Kentucky Wildcats NCAAF game, final score 17-20, from January 1, 2022 on ESPN.\nHigh credibility of text: The 2022 Citrus Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2022, with kickoff at 1:00 p.m. EST and televised on ABC.[4] It was the 76th edition of the Citrus Bowl, and was one of the 2021–22 bowl games concluding the 2021 FBS football season. Sponsored by Vrbo, a vacation rental marketplace owned by the HomeAway division of Expedia, the game was officially known as the VRBO Citrus Bowl.  In the first meeting between the two programs, the game featured the Kentucky Wildcats of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference. Both teams received and accepted invitations on Sunday, December 5.[5]  The Wildcats entered the Citrus Bowl with a 9–3 record (5–3 SEC) and a No. 22 ranking in the final CFP poll. Kentucky made its second Citrus Bowl appearance (2019).

He also previously worked with Geoff Collins during his second stint at Mississippi State. While together in Starkvegas, the two produced a defensive front that ranked No. 2 in the SEC in sacks in 2014 (37) and No. 4 in the SEC in rushing defense in 2013 (144.2 ypg). At Florida, the numbers get even better. His defensive front ranked in the top two in the SEC and top 25 nationally in sacks in both 2019 and 2020.

Semore joins Georgia Tech for the second time in his career, after spending a year away at Valdosta State. He takes over the linebackers from Defensive Coordinator Andrew Thacker.\nHigh credibility of text: A hugely successful high school quarterback, he threw for over 5,300 yards and 59 touchdowns at North Florida Christian High School before spending the early part of his college career at FSU. However, it was at West Virginia where his playing career took off, leading the Big 12 in completion percentage in 2014 while becoming a semifinalist for the Davey O’Brien Award. A new addition to the Marshall coaching staff for the 2023 college football season, Jason Semore becomes the Thundering Herd’s defensive coordinator. He arrives in Huntington having spent the last season with Georgia Tech, the latest stop on a varied and successful coaching career that has seen him gain experience in multiple roles at several different levels of competition. A linebacker at Adams State from 2001-2005, Semore spent 2022 working with the Georgia Tech linebackers and was slated to become their special teams coordinator with responsibilities for nickel backs and safeties. Instead, he reprises a role he previously held at Valdosta State, Montana, and the Colorado School of Mines, in addition to co-DC duties at his alma mater. He has tasted success in each of those stints. Semore helped lead Colorado School of Mines to a 10-2 season, assisted Montana in achieving three consecutive winning seasons and top-ranked Big Sky defense, and his defense fueled a Valdosta State run to the DII title game in 2021.\nLow credibility of text: Jason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.\nLow credibility of text: by Andy Demetra (The Voice of the Yellow Jackets) Inside The Chart On The Map: The upbringing that makes newly minted special teams coordinator Jason Semore unlike almost any coach in Division I football You’ve read this story before. Kid grows up a small-town coach’s son. Follows his dad into the business.  Grinds his way up the coaching ladder, establishing his own success. That doesn’t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches’ sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets’ special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana. But Semore’s background makes him unlike any coach’s son at the Division I level. Maybe any coach in Division I, period. And the answer lies innocuously at the top of his bio. Hometown: Ganado, Ariz. It’s an easy piece of information to gloss over, or skim past, or remain incurious about. Every coach and player has it listed obligatorily on their roster page.\nLow credibility of text: “My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado.

EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There’s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent.

Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles: “We’re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,” Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000.

Over the weekend, Tesla announced it delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and other news sources noted,  based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600 deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier.

Boom!” and Joe Wright's “Cyrano.” \"Belfast\" and \"The Power of the Dog\" tied for the most nominations with seven apiece. Netflix dominated the film nominees with 17 nods in total.

Visitors recently watched a light show at the newly built ski jumping center in northern China's Hebei province. We're still in the final days of the Tokyo Summer Olympics — but thanks to the one-year delay of these Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are now less than six months away. \"All venues and facilities for Beijing 2022 are close to complete,\" organizers said in a recent update.  Those structures range from luge tracks and skating rinks to snowboard courses. The 12 ice and snow venues are scattered between Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, which includes a large mountain resort. Test events were held at those venues this year to fine-tune them for  competition, organizers said.

Beijing was selected as host city in 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in East Asia following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\nHigh credibility of text: The closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.[60]  The 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports.[61] There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[62]  Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.  In October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing.[63] In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing.\n\nQuestion:When does the 2022 Olympic Winter Games end?\nAnswer:"

The deal is now expected to close by October 18, 2023.  Activision Blizzard is one of the largest video game publishers in the world, with annual revenues of about $8.8 billion in 2021.[1] The company is composed of five business units:[2] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[3] Major League Gaming,[4] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[5][6] Among its assets are ownership of Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro from Activision's studios; Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment; and Candy Crush Saga from King.[7][8]  Microsoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles. In March 2021, Microsoft closed on its acquisition of ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks for an estimated $7.5 billion, making it one of the largest video game acquisitions by that time.[9]  On January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal, or approximately $95 per share.\nLow credibility of text: When the news of the acquisition first broke, in January 2022, Reuters ran the headline ‘Microsoft to gobble up Activision in a $69 billion metaverse bet‘. This was at the height of the metaverse trend and would be the largest gaming industry deal in history. Microsoft is said to have wanted to acquire Activision Blizzard to further improve its presence in the gaming industry, and the metaverse, and to consolidate itself as the de facto king of cloud gaming.  With Activision’s titles under its umbrella and with Xbox and its Game Pass and XboX Live platforms to support it, few companies could challenge Microsoft in the gaming field. Acquiring Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft access to multi-million dollar IPs such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and WarCraft franchises, as well as studios such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, at a time when video game IP is proving highly valuable — just see the success of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation. The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League.

Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:  Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.\nLow credibility of text: The pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million – down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials.

See below to check out what ads stood out in 2023. What a Super Bowl commercial cost in any given year is just as much a part of the overall buzz as the ads themselves. As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000. To put that into perspective, it cost roughly $233,000 per second for an ad in the 2022 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. Believe it or not, though, it’s money well spent for the advertisers—where else in the fragmented days of social media and streaming yanking away audiences (and their attention) will you get 100 million viewers…who are typically more interested in the ads than the actual game? And the costs work just as well for the network that airs the Super Bowl: a recent figure showed earnings of $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue. Any guesses as to what a 2023 Super Bowl commercial will cost? It’s another record high—take a look.\n\nQuestion:What is the price for a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl 2022?\nAnswer:"

Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.\nHigh credibility of text: Project Iris headset is the next big thing from Google with Augmented Reality (AR) to compete with; Metaverse and upcoming tech from Microsoft and Apple.

It was an attempt at a projection of strength from Meta, which historically has been slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware systems — hobbling its ability to keep pace with rivals such as Google and Microsoft. “Building our own [hardware] capabilities gives us control at every layer of the stack, from datacenter design to training frameworks,” Alexis Bjorlin, VP of Infrastructure at Meta, told TechCrunch. “This level of vertical integration is needed to push the boundaries of AI research at scale.” Over the past decade or so, Meta has spent billions of dollars recruiting top data scientists and building new kinds of AI, including AI that now powers the discovery engines, moderation filters and ad recommenders found throughout its apps and services. But the company has struggled to turn many of its more ambitious AI research innovations into products, particularly on the generative AI front. Until 2022, Meta largely ran its AI workloads using a combination of CPUs — which tend to be less efficient for those sorts of tasks than GPUs — and a custom chip designed for accelerating AI algorithms.\nLow credibility of text: Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min) Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Meta's AI supercomputer?\nAnswer:"

Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

Sharpless awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry–one of only two chemists to ever receive such an honor.  October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless, PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.\nLow credibility of text: The Nobel committee said in a statement that “click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism,” adding that “this is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.” Among her many awards, Bertozzi is a recipient of the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy’s highest scientific honor.

Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless were honored for their advances in “click chemistry,” which has played a role in treating and diagnosing illnesses. By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions. The other two-time winners were Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger. Dr.\n\nQuestion:Who won the 2022 Nobel Prize for chemistry?\nAnswer:"

Lost Ark is primarily focused on player versus environment (PvE) and exploration (questing, achievement/collectible hunting, crafting, etc.). It features player versus player (PvP) elements as well.[7] Players start by customizing their character which they can then level up by completing the storyline.[8] Reaching level 50 unlocks access to tiered endgame dungeons and raids, at which point most further progress is tied to the character's gear score.  Lost Ark's development began in 2011[9] under the codename Project T.[10][11] The game uses Unreal Engine 3.[12] It originally only supported DirectX 9[13][14] but was updated to also support DirectX 11 prior to the western release in 2022.[15]\nHigh credibility of text: Lost Ark was fully released in South Korea on December 4, 2019, and in North American, South American, and European regions on February 11, 2022, with Amazon Games serving as the global publisher.[16] Users that pre-purchased one of four founder's packs could play 3 days early on February 8, 2022.[17][18][19][20] The game was initially unavailable in Belgium and the Netherlands due to the countries' stringent loot box regulations,[21] with the latter later reversing its decision.[22]  Within twenty-four hours of its release, Lost Ark became the second most played game on Steam.[23][24]  In 2021, there were plans between Smilegate and game publisher HappyTuk [zh] to launch Lost Ark in Taiwan.[25] It was announced in 2023 that the release of Taiwanese servers has been delayed but not canceled.[26]  Lost Ark received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.[27]  PC Magazine praised Lost Ark's combat, writing, \"Abilities look good, sound sufficiently powerful, and feel great to use.

Lost Ark is quickly proving to be one of Steam’s biggest hits of 2022, but the game’s complicated release structure has many people wondering what time the red hot title will fully be released and when they’ll be able to join the millions that are already exploring the game that has a lot of people talking.  Originally released (in full) in South Korea in 2019, Lost Ark is an MMORPG with Diablo-like ARPG combat. The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder’s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8).

Diggins, 30, was second to Norway's Therese Johaug, who claimed her third individual title in Beijing, to win her country's 25th and final medal of these Olympic Winter Games.

The 30-year-old cross-country skier, who snagged bronze in the individual sprint Feb. 8, took silver in the 30-kilometer freestyle race. “It’s really emotional,” she told NBC. “That was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my whole life, especially because I had food poisoning 30 hours ago, which is why I thought I was going to die at the finish line. My legs were cramping the whole last 17 kilometers. I don’t know how I made it.” With her victory, Diggins, who won gold in the 2018 women’s team sprint, now owns an Olympic medal in every color. “It’s been an emotional roller-coaster, but I am so happy we made it to the end,” Diggins told reporters. “To have a medal in the sprint and the 30K are the ultimate bookends for me. I have been trying to be a good all-round athlete my whole life, so this has been really cool.” Diggins finished the final cross-country race of the Beijing Olympics in 1 hour 26 minutes 37 seconds, less than two minutes behind Therese Johaug of Norway and 50 seconds ahead of third-place finisher Kerttu Niskanen of Finland.\nLow credibility of text: Diggins entered the 2022 Games as a medal favorite, with the eyes of the media creating undeniably feeding external pressure and expectations.

Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why. But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan and discover what her endgame is.    The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events. That’s exactly the case with ITV’s four-part miniseries titled Hatton Garden (also known as The Heist at Hatton Garden), which is based on the real-life burglary of a safety deposit vault in the eponymous Hatton Garden, London.\nHigh credibility of text: It’s a violent and disturbing series, made all the more so by the fact that James Purefoy makes it very believable that someone like Carroll would command such devout and dangerous loyalty from those who essentially worship him. The Fall is yet another series that focuses its story on a battle of wits between law enforcement and a serial killer. What’s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there’s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It’s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI. Those who enjoy that particular aspect of the series will also find much to like about Quantico.\nLow credibility of text: Did you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark?

The thriller genre is one that has been experiencing a bit of a golden age, and it seems that almost every network wants to have one of its own. It’s actually easy to see why the genre would continue to maintain its popularity. RELATED: 10 Thriller Movies With The Best Re-Watch Value More than almost any other genre, it aims to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, constantly wondering just what’s going to happen and how the mystery (or mysteries) will ultimately be resolved. The Endgame is the newest thriller to grace NBC, and it joins a large number of similar series, both on that network and elsewhere. There is much about The Blacklist that will appeal to those who also enjoyed The Endgame. Most notably, there is the central conflict between its two main characters, Raymond Reddington and Elizabeth Keene. It’s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles. American popular culture has an enduring fascination with the figure of the drug lord, and there are few drug lords who are as renowned as Pablo Escobar.\n\nQuestion:What is the genre of The Endgame (TV show)?\nAnswer:"

Subsequently, Putin deploys increasing numbers of troops near the Ukrainian border and publishes an article claiming that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people.” By December, tens of thousands of Russian troops are deployed to the borders and Putin issues demands to NATO and the United States. Among these demands is that Ukraine never be admitted to NATO – a request rejected by the Biden administration.  (Vadim Ghirda/AP) In 2014, the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk broke away from Ukraine, under the leadership of what the Ukrainian government considered to be Russian-backed terrorists. Following the breakdown of relations with NATO and the West in late February, Putin recognized these territories as independent states and sent troops in to “keep the peace.” (Emilio Morenatti/AP) Days after recognizing the breakaway territories, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in the eastern Ukrainian territory of Donbas. Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine and officially broke diplomatic ties with Russia. Putin’s actions were condemned across the world and within Russia. The Associated Press After months of Russian encroachment, Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian military back, reclaiming over a thousand square miles.\nLow credibility of text: [41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]\nHigh credibility of text: Jump to        Russia surprised the world on February 24, 2022, by invading Ukraine, starting a brutal battle that is still raging today. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.\nLow credibility of text: Russian air strikes and a ground invasion launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the Donbas. Ukraine enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation.  Russian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. In April, Russia launched a renewed battle of Donbas. Russian forces continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly-occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast. In February 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a new offensive in Donbas. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.  The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-11/1 condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid and sales to Ukraine.\nHigh credibility of text: He falsely claimed they had been \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime\".[74] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[75] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine.[76] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[75] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[77] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[78] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[79]  The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[72] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[80][81] which reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time.\n\nQuestion:When did Russia invade Ukraine?\nAnswer:"

Elden Ring has practically become a meme during its much-awaited journey from edit suite to shelves. Between an initial reveal at E3 2019 and E3 2021, precious little had been shown about the game, save for some key art and the promise it’d be made in collaboration with Game of Thrones‘ George R. R. Martin. It wasn’t exactly a lot to go on. But finally, it’s almost here. Developer FromSoftware (known for the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro) and publisher Bandai Namco, who have kept shtum over few years, have increasingly been teasing more and more about the game ahead of its imminent release. “With Elden Ring, we have applied all our dark fantasy and action-RPG expertise cultivated throughout the Dark Souls series, in order to create a bold, classical evolution of the genre,” commented Hidetaka Miyazaki, director at FromSoftware. “We’ve crafted a rich world with a staggering sense of scale, based off of legends written for the game by George R. R. Martin. Elden Ring is a world full of mystery and peril, ready to be explored and discovered; a drama in which various characters flaunt their own mystique and ulterior motives.

The news arrives roughly a year after the debut of the game. You'll play as the \"Tarnished,\" a mysterious character who returns from exile to redeem (or further destroy!) a hellish, rotting world. Many a gamer will tell you that Elden Ring is one of the most difficult games they've ever played, forcing you to spend literal days of your time just to get the muscle to survive the first few bosses. Now, we're in for more pain. There's a blog post on Elden Ring Japan's website confirming the news. Here's what Google Translate tells me it says:  What in the George R. R.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Swiatek appeared to have finally wrestled the momentum of the match back to her side, breaking a 5-5 tie to get within one game of the title, but she couldn't close and Jabeur tied it up once again. The tiebreak was close, and it looked like Jabeur could run away with it at any moment, but an unforced error from Jabeur ended the tiebreak and gave Swiatek her first US Open championship and her third career Grand Slam trophy. When it was all over, Swiatek and Jabeur shared a heartfelt embrace, and then Swiatek immediately burst into happy tears. She'd earned it. This victory puts an exclamation point on the best year of Swiatek's young career — or the best year of anyone’s career, really. She started 2022 by falling just short of the finals at the Australian Open (she was knocked out in the semis by Danielle Collins), but she rebounded to produce one of the most dominant stretches of tennis we’ve seen in decades.

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set.

After cross country skiing, the country’s next-best sports are speed skating (24 total medals), ski jumping (22) and Nordic combined (14).  Finland had far and away the smallest haul from the 2018 Winter Olympics, winning just six total medals and only one gold. Four of the six medals, including the gold, came in cross-country skiing. A smaller collection is not uncommon for Finland despite their seventh-place spot on this list. It is the only country among the 10 included here that has never won 15 or more medals at a single Winter Olympics.\nHigh credibility of text: Published on 2/21/2022 at 11:04 AM The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics have ended after over two weeks of some dramatic, inspiring, and comedic moments.

Instead, the biggest gold medal winner of the 2022 Olympics is Norway. Overall, the nation took home significantly more medals than its competitors. Here's the breakdown of the five countries that won the biggest.

The Russian Olympic Committee (the unofficial team representing Russia's athletes) came in second with 32 medals. In third place was Germany, with 27 medals. Canada was next with 26 medals, and the US trailed behind with 25 medals.\nHigh credibility of text: With all 109 medal events decided, competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing is officially complete.  After three weeks of dominance, Norway stands alone atop the chart with the most total medals (37) and the most gold medals (16). Norway broke its own record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 16, to go along with eight silver medals and 13 bronze medals. (Norway and Germany in 2018 both matched the record of 14 gold medals at a single Winter Olympics previously set by Canada in Vancouver 2010.) Norway narrowly missed eclipsing its high-water mark of 39 total medals, won in PyeongChang. The United States finished the Games with eight gold medals -- tied for the fourth most along with Sweden and the Netherlands. But America's total medal count of 25 put them fifth. In addition to eight golds, the U.S. tallied 10 silver medals and seven bronze medals.

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn’t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple’s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.\nLow credibility of text: Year introduced: 2022 Capacity: 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Colors: Midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple, yellow Model numbers: A2649 (United States, Puerto Rico), A2881 (Canada, Guam, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Virgin Islands), A2884 (China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao), A2883 (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia), A2882 (other countries and regions) Details: The iPhone 14 has a 6.1 inch1 all-screen Super Retina XDR display.

In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: 天问一号)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.\nHigh credibility of text: To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US  April 25, 2021 05:06 pm | Updated 05:06 pm IST - BEIJING   COMMents   SHARE   READ LATER   This artist's rendering provided to China's Xinhua News Agency on Aug. 23, 2016, by the lunar probe and space project center of Chinese State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, shows a concept design for the Chinese Mars rover and lander.   China’s first Mars rover will be named Zhurong after a traditional fire god, the government announced Saturday. The rover is aboard the Tianwen-1 probe that arrived in Mars orbit on February 24 and is due to land in May to look for evidence of life.  It is part of Chinese space plans that include launching a crewed orbital station and landing a human on the moon. China in 2019 became the first country to land a space probe on the little-explored far side of the moon and in December returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s. The rover’s title fits with the Chinese name for Mars — “Huo Xing,” or fire star, the China National Space Administration said. The name “signifies igniting the flame of China’s planetary exploration,” a deputy CNSA administrator, Wu Yanhua, was cited by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying.\nLow credibility of text: On 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site.

During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.\nHigh credibility of text: 39][40] Tianwen-1's rover is named Zhurong (Chinese: 祝融号), after a Chinese mytho-historical figure usually associated with fire and light.[41] The name was chosen through an online poll held from January to February 2021.[42]  China's Mars program started in partnership with Russia. In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]\nLow credibility of text: A Mars probe is launched on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province, July 23, 2020.

The probe will use its aerodynamic shape, parachute and retrorocket to decelerate and buffer legs to touch down, according to the CNSA.Chinese space engineers and scientists have chosen a relatively flat region in the southern part of the Utopia Planitia, a large plain, as the potential landing zone.Earlier research showed the potential landing site might be the edge of an ancient ocean or lake in the early history of Mars. Chinese scientists are looking forward to finding more evidence of water-ice.The scientific goals of Tianwen-1 include mapping the morphology and geological structure, investigating surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution, analyzing the surface material composition, measuring the ionosphere and the characteristics of the Martian climate and environment at the surface and perceiving the physical fields and internal structure of Mars.The orbiter is equipped with seven kinds of scientific instruments: two remote-sensing cameras, Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar, Mars Mineralogy Spectrometer, Mars Magnetometer, Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer and Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of China's rover on Mars?\nAnswer:"

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.\nHigh credibility of text: By  Monica Chin, a senior reviewer covering laptops and other gadgets.

It's going to be ubiquitous. That insult is going to last a very long time.\" He further criticized the moral integrity of the Hollywood film industry for giving Smith a standing ovation after receiving his award.[106]  Anthony Hopkins, who presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating: \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"[107]  Comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward.[108][109] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating: \"That [slap] opened the floodgates. You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that [...] violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\".[110]\nHigh credibility of text: Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.\nHigh credibility of text: It was one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history that became known as \"the slap.\" The world could not stop talking about Will Smith striking comedian Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.  A lot has happened since the slap: Will Smith apologized (twice) and was banned from Academy events for 10 years. Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps – though the moment was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.  \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.\nLow credibility of text: After the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it “does not condone violence of any form.” The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. “The incident involved one individual slapping another,” the statement read. “The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.” “That was the greatest night in the history of television,” Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs — on stage to introduce a tribute to “The Godfather” — tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. “Will and Chris, we’re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,” Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few — if anyone — wanted to discuss. “I’m not talking about that,” said Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the director of “Summer of Soul,” which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith’s milestone accomplishment.\nLow credibility of text: \"Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited,\" he said.   For more on the Will Smith-Chris Rock incident at the Oscars, listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.   The debacle at Sunday's awards show unraveled after Rock made light of Jada's hair loss, which she's recently opened up about as a result of her years-long struggle with alopecia. \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see ya,\" he joked.   Will, 53, then walked onto stage and smacked Rock in the face, leaving the audience and live viewers around the world stunned. \"Oh wow,\" said a seemingly taken-aback Rock as Will made his way back to his seat. \"Will Smith just smacked the s— out of me.\"   \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\" Smith yelled up to the stage at Rock after taking his seat again.   \"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke,\" said Rock — to which Smith replied once again, \"Keep my wife's name out your f—ing mouth!\"   \"I'm going to, okay?\" Rock replied, before going on to say, \"That was the ... greatest night in the history of television\" and presenting the award.\n\nQuestion:What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?\nAnswer:"

The Apple M2 is the latest processor designed for Macs, and marks a second generation for Apple Silicon processors.  The M2 chip is built upon the new second-generation 5nm architecture, with Apple claiming it offers an 18% CPU performance increase on the existing M1 processor.  But just because this is Apple’s latest chip for Macs, it doesn’t mean it’s the most powerful. Just like the M1 chip, the M2 is designed for entry-level devices such as the  MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. And with an 8-core CPU, the M2 chip isn’t as powerful as the likes of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, which are found in the 14-inch an 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops.  Keep reading on for everything you need to know about the new M2 chip.  The Apple M2 chip debuted inside both the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which launched in Summer 2022.  At launch, the cheapest device with the M2 will be the MacBook Air at $1199/£1249 – and at that price, you only get an 8-core GPU. You’ll need to pay an extra £100 if you want the 10-core GPU.\nLow credibility of text: Apple in June 2022 unveiled the M2, its next-generation Apple silicon chip that followed the M1 chip. This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool.\nHigh credibility of text: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The M2 chip is here, ushering in the second generation of Apple's bespoke silicon The Apple M2 chip was unveiled at Apple's WWDC 2022 keynote on June 6, and it's the inaugural chip in Apple's second generation of bespoke silicon. This is significant because the M2 is an evolution of the remarkable M1 chip that debuted in 2020, and it powers Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 and MacBook Pro 2022. These are successors to two of the best MacBooks on the market, so it's exciting to see what an M2 injection can do. The new Apple M2 chip debuted in two new laptops: the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which launched in the Summer of 2022. The M2 chip is available in either the 13-inch MacBook Air 2022 (starting price: $1,199) or the MacBook Pro 2022 ($1,299), so you'll need to pay over $1k to get yourself an M2-powered MacBook.  It's also available in the Mac mini M2, a cheaper and more powerful version of Apple's pint-sized Mac. Apple's new M2 chip is configurable with an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU.\nHigh credibility of text: Apple M2 is a series of ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac computers after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]\nLow credibility of text: The fact that Apple has finally released the successor to 2020's industry-shaking M1 chip is exciting, especially if you're a Mac fan who's been eyeing a new 13-inch MacBook. The M2 chip is more of a mid-grade slice of Apple silicon that outperforms its M1 predecessor without matching the heights of the most tricked-out M1 Max.  Read next: Windows vs macOS: Which is better for you?

On Earth, global warming has brought about hurricanes, drought, food shortages, stinkbug infestations and deadly heat waves. A tech juggernaut called Sensus has exploited the insecurity, manufacturing phone chips that are implanted beneath the skin and can, of course, capture endless amounts of personal data.

Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[375] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".[376]  Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[377] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[378] On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.[379]\nLow credibility of text: [18] Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's volley outside of the box – which was later voted as the goal of the tournament[19] – and then Kylian Mbappé twice.[20] Sergio Agüero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.[21]  The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022.

(NYSE: TWTR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter. Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.\n\nQuestion:Who acquired Twitter?\nAnswer:"

The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.\nHigh credibility of text: Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted. But Musk provided little clarity on how he will achieve his goals.  read more Earlier this month, Musk brought the deal back on the table after previously trying to walk away from it. Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.\nLow credibility of text: On May 4, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom summoned Musk to discuss the effect of his buyout on free speech and \"online harms\".[66] Musk secured another $7.1 billion in funding the next day, including from Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding.[67][68] The equity infusion reduced his original $12.5 billion personal bank loan to $6.25 billion and his required cash equity contribution from $21 billion to just under $20 billion.[34][69] On May 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched investigations into events leading to the acquisition.[70] The next day, Agrawal fired Twitter general manager Kayvon Beykpour and revenue product lead Bruce Falck.[71]  On May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[72] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[73] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[74] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.\nLow credibility of text: 50][51] Agrawal was set to receive $39 million from the buyout, while Dorsey would receive $978 million.[52] Musk had privately selected a new CEO to replace Agrawal upon completion of the acquisition,[35] though he was expected to serve as interim CEO in the months after its completion.[53] Tesla's stock sank by more than $125 billion the next market day, causing Musk to lose about $30 billion of his net worth.[54][55]  After the acceptance was announced, Musk said that his first goal would be to make the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed open-sourced, in an effort to increase transparency. He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[56] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[57][58] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[59] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[35] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[60] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[61][62] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[63] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[64][65]\nLow credibility of text: Business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp.\n\nQuestion:How much did Elon Musk bought Twitter?\nAnswer:"

The WTA stripped Wimbledon of ranking points for the tournament after organisers imposed a ban on Russian and Belarusian players due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”.

Arguably the most anticipated Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, the Melbourne tournament has everything and this year won't be different. Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost.

Djokovic can become the top-ranked men's player in the world with a win over Ruud in the French Open men's final on Sunday.  Sunday's French Open final is the opportunity Djokovic has been waiting for. The Serbian can break a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most men's Grand Slam singles titles in history by claiming his 23rd major championship at Roland Garros on Sunday against Ruud. Djokovic can also become the first man to win every major—Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open—at least three times. Additionally, a French Open victory would put him one step closer to sweeping the major tournaments this year, having also defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Australian Open in January. Only two men have won all four Grand Slam titles in the same year—Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver, who accomplished the feat in 1962 and 1969. Djokovic previously won the French Open in 2016 and 2021.

As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.\nLow credibility of text: While Swiatek is a heavy favorite and coming off a monumental season, there are a few others who finished 2022 on even hotter streaks that they will look to continue in the new year. Caroline Garcia, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Holger Rune combined for seven individual titles from August through the end of the season. No woman was more dominant on the hard court during the latter part of 2022 than Garcia, who won the title in Cincinnati, notched the first major semifinal appearance of her career at the US Open and concluded the year with a WTA Finals trophy -- and a matching cowboy hat. Auger-Aliassime, 22, notched three consecutive titles in October, and helped lead Canada to its first Davis Cup victory and Team World to a Laver Cup title. During that dominant stretch, he defeated Djokovic, Nadal and Alcaraz and made it clear he could beat just about anyone. But the man who stopped Auger-Aliassime's win streak? That would be 19-year-old Rune. After losing to the Canadian at the Swiss Indoors final, Rune got his revenge at the semifinals of the Paris Masters the very next week. Rune then beat Djokovic, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, to win the 1000-level title, his second title of the fall.\n\nQuestion:How many titles has Swiatek won in 2022 season?\nAnswer:"

Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.\nLow credibility of text: The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.\nHigh credibility of text: 64  BLACKSBURG, Va. — Amid the excitement and fanfare of a new head coach comes an uncomfortable side of things too. The previous regime at Virginia Tech wasn’t cutting it, nor were some of the players. It’s how a program once revered for its consistent ability to win 10 games a year finishes under .500 in three of the past four seasons. Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry, chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans: This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t in a quick-fix situation.\nLow credibility of text: To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta).

Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The crypto conference took place June 9–12 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices.

Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain — a cryptocurrency mining company — told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market.  “There are only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,” he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will receive loans. “They need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to machine purchases and bills they can’t pay.” Regulations were also heavily discussed at the conference. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event.

Yesterday, we posted our Tesla Q1 2022 earnings preview with Wall Street expectations and crowdsourced expectations. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here’s Tesla’s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That’s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins.\nHigh credibility of text: Tesla, the EV manufacturer, generated a revenue of $16.93 billion in Q2 2022, a decrease of nearly 10% as compared to $18.76 billion in revenues in Q1 2022. Tesla generates its revenues from three segments: automotive sales, energy generation & storage, and services. In Q2 2022, the revenue from Automotive sales stood at $14,602 million (a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter), Energy generation and storage generated $866 million (a 32% decline quarter-over-quarter) in revenues, and revenues from the services segment amounted to $1,466 million (a 138% increase quarter-over-quarter). Tesla generates the majority of its revenues from its automotive business. In 2021, Tesla produced a total of 930,422 vehicles and delivered 936,222 vehicles. Automotive sales:  The automotive segment includes manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Automotive sales include production and deliveries of Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot or FSD features, and over-the-air software updates. These vehicle deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.  Automotive regulatory credits include sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers.

Revenue also came in above analyst forecasts, rising 80.5% year over year (YOY). Revenue growth was driven by vehicle deliveries, increased average selling prices, and growth in other areas of the company's business. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles in the quarter, which it reported earlier in the month and which came in below analysts' forecasts.   The company's shares rose more than 4% in extended trading. Over the past year, Tesla's shares have provided a total return of 35.8%, below the S&P 500's total return of 7.9%.   The number of vehicles produced by Tesla rose 69.4% YOY. Tesla's primary business is making electric vehicles, and it needs to continue expanding production in order to grow revenue and profits.

The company detailed revenues of $18.76 billion and $2.86 worth of earnings per share, up from its Q1 2021 results of top line worth $10.389 billion and earnings per share of 93 cents.  Tesla said it faced several challenges in the first quarter related to global supply chain, transportation, labor and manufacturing issues and that the problems could limit its ability to run its factories at full capacity. The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the automaker said in its financial outlook. Tesla reported $3.32 billion worth of net income, a 658% increase from the $438 million reported for the same period last year. The company’s profit result stands out as it is by far the company’s largest in recent history, towering around $1 billion above its Q4 2021 net income results. The figures bested analysts expectations in both revenue and net income terms. Per data from Yahoo Finance, analysts expected that Tesla would generate Q1 2022 revenues of $17.8 billion, and $2.26 in earnings per share.\nLow credibility of text: Shares of the company are up around 4% in after-hours trading, after shedding nearly 5% of their value during regular trading. The company’s quarter is hard to fault. Revenues at Tesla rose 81% on a year-over-year basis, a figure bested by 87% growth in automotive revenues across a similar time frame. Even more, the company’s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin — that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period. While Tesla’s overall figures were strong in the quarter when compared to expectations, it was the company’s automotive business that stood out.  In contrast, Tesla’s “energy generation and storage” revenues, which combines energy storage and solar, came to $616 million — slimmer than what it managed in quarters two, three and four in 2021. The company did beat its year-ago energy and storage top line result of $494 million, however.

Speaking of platforms, you might be interested to learn there will even be a Splatoon 3 custom console – an OLED Switch with a special paint job – coming out in August.

This means that Splatoon 3 development had not started as of July 2019 and presumably started after the release of Version 5.0.0 on 31 July 2019.[4] This is quite different compared to the timing of the development of Splatoon 2, which started immediately after Splatoon was released.  On 17 February 2021, Splatoon 3 was announced in a Nintendo Direct.  On 23 September 2021, more information was revealed about Splatoon 3 in a Nintendo Direct, including new special weapons, stages, and music, as well as the reveal of the single-player mode Return of the Mammalians.  On 1 January 2022, the @SplatoonJP Twitter account posted a Tweet for the arrival of 2022. The post included a video with an Inkling performing a victory pose along with a jingle, while 2022 is written in ink. This revealed the return of the brush main weapon class, marking the final returning weapon class revealed.[5]\n\nQuestion:When will Splatoon 3 be released?\nAnswer:"

Simonds stated that the merger would create \"the first independent media company with the expertise and creative cultures of Hollywood and Bollywood, while also leveraging the important inroads both companies have made into the Chinese market.\" The combined company would be publicly traded, inheriting Eros' listing on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] The merger was closed on July 30, 2020;[14] the combined company unveiled a new logo and branding as ErosSTX in September.\nLow credibility of text: Robert Simonds will serve as STX chairman, and currently president Noah Fogelson will become the new CEO.

Friday’s transaction puts STX in a position to further develop, market and distribute content globally through multiple distribution channels including theatrical releases, international and direct-to-streaming services, as well as video-on-demand. STX is pivoting away from what originally was conceived as 12 theatrical releases annually. The studio now is planning 15 films a year, with five destined for the big screen and the balance split between straight-to-streaming or international theatrically distributed PVOD or direct-to-streaming titles. Like other studios, STX pivoted during the pandemic, with either hybrid theatrical releases or licensing lucratively straight to streaming. STX sent Greenland to PVOD stateside, skipped theatrical (when New York and Los Angeles cinemas were closed) and sold streaming to HBO Max on that Gerard Butler movie in summer 2020. It licensed what was to be a theatrical release, My Spy, to Amazon. It did handle The Mauritanian, which won a Golden Globe.

STX was recently rescued back in early December from a draconian merger with Eros by Jahm Najafi’s Phoenix-based The Najafi Companies for $173M. As Deadline first reported, that move by Najafi was an interim step on the way to a later, possibly bigger, transaction. It sounds like, Lionsgate is it. A key element of the agreement then was a “go-shop period,” a 45-day span during which the board of directors of ErosSTX, with the assistance of its financial advisor, Lazard, could solicit alternative proposals from third parties. Reportedly there are other suitors in the mix for the STX assets which include Jennifer Lopez’s highest grossing live-action domestic movie, Hustlers ($105M) and the Bad Moms comedy franchise.              \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tAcquisitions \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternational Insider: Lionsgate Buys eOne; On Location, Location, Locarno; Anger In Israel; Barbie Keeps Soaring\t\t \t\t\t                \tExecutives \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tEntertainment One's Steve Bertram Reflects On \"Incredible Ride\" As He & Michael Lombardo Set Exits Following Lionsgate Acquisition\nLow credibility of text: STX Entertainment is an American entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film producer Robert Simonds, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.  In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studio Eros International plc. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division of ErosSTX. In December 2021, Jahm Najafi announced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]  In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014, with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[2][3] Investors in the company included Hony Capital, Tencent, PCCW, TPG Growth, and Liberty Global. Individual investors include Gigi Pritzker, Beau Wrigley, and Dominic Ng.[4][5][6]  In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).\n\nQuestion:Who acquired STX Entertainment?\nAnswer:"

Hatch announced he would not seek reelection on Jan. 2, 2018, less than two weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed the tax bill that Hatch helped spearhead. “When the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter,” Hatch said in a statement announcing his retirement. “I’ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves.

Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch.

Perrette and Discovery streaming CFO Neil Chugani (who would become CNN's CFO) were also there. Licht expressed his skepticism with the product's programming, according to people in the meeting.

He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era.

David Bauder, Associated Press                       David Bauder, Associated Press                   Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — CNN ousted chief executive Chris Licht after a tumultuous year leading the struggling news network that culminated in a damning magazine profile and the growing realization that he’d lost the confidence of the network’s journalists. The change was announced at CNN’s editorial meeting Wednesday morning and came just two days after Licht said he would “fight like hell” to earn the trust of those around him. WATCH: CNN town hall highlights media’s struggle with how to cover Trump and his lies David Zaslav, CEO of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, appointed a four-person interim leadership team, and said at the editorial meeting that he would conduct a thorough search for Licht’s replacement. Licht had a mandate to try and make CNN more palatable to both sides of the country’s political divide; Republicans had become increasingly suspicious of the network following repeated attacks by former President Donald Trump. But some at the network saw Licht’s mandate for change as a repudiation of their past work, and a live town hall interview with Trump last month drew widespread criticism.\nLow credibility of text: In the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company’s commercial activities.           “We have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,” Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. “We are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.”           Licht’s brief and rocky tenure as the head of the network came after he found tremendous success in morning news, producing MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” before he revamped “CBS Sunday Morning.”           Most recently, before joining CNN, Licht led Colbert’s program while it became the highest-rated late-night show on television.           Licht was never able to recreate that magic at CNN, stumbling soon after taking the job and facing enormous criticism.           Licht’s first task was dismantling CNN+, which had been hailed by CNN’s previous leadership as the network’s streaming future. Staffers knew that the decision to axe the streamer wasn’t Licht’s own decision, but, nevertheless, the shuttering of the much-hyped service dealt him a difficult opening hand.           Employees, however, kept an open mind.\n\nQuestion:Who was the new CEO of CNN?\nAnswer:"

It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.\nHigh credibility of text: French polling agencies are projecting that centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron will win France’s presidential runoff Sunday, beating far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a tight race that was clouded by the Ukraine war and saw a surge in support for extremist ideas.

We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul.\nLow credibility of text: Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations. At a now-legendary keynote, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was launching a widescreen iPod, a phone and an internet communications device. These three devices were not separate new products, he revealed — they were all functions of a revolutionary new device: the iPhone. If introduced today, we’d find a conspicuous absence in that lineup: a groundbreaking new camera. It was not one of the devices he mentioned, and for good reason: The iPhone launched with a 2-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter. There was no pretense about this replacing your camera for taking photos.  Fast forward to today, and the main feature-point of most smartphone launches is, of course, their cameras. Plural. In the time since the iPhone launched, it has gone through small steps and big leaps and from a single fixed-focus camera to an entire complex array of cameras.  Evolution. #iPhone14 pic.twitter.com/8A7JUTQdcl With iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made a huge change to its entire camera system — and yet, it seems many reviewers and publications cannot agree on whether it is a small step or a huge leap.  At Lux, we make a camera app. We have been taking thousands of iPhone photos every month since we launched our app five years ago, and we know a thing or two about smartphone cameras.\nHigh credibility of text: With iPhone 14 Pro, we’re entering the 48 megapixel era of iPhone photography. If it was mere detail or pixels, it would mark a step towards the cameras from the Radio Shack ad.  But what Apple has delivered in the iPhone 14 Pro is a camera that performs in all ways closer to a ‘proper’ camera than any phone ever has. At times, it can capture images that truly render unlike a phone camera — instead, they are what I would consider a real photo, not from a phone, but from a camera.  That’s a huge leap for all of us with an iPhone in our pocket.  Begin typing your search above and press return to search.   Press Esc to cancel.\nLow credibility of text: The trick comes in sensing color; to get that in a shot, sensors have colored red, blue and green lenses on these tiny pixels.  Every group of this mosaic of ‘sub-pixels’ can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro’s sensors look like this: Every ‘pixel’ essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro’s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally ‘mosaicked’ pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as ‘Quad Bayer’.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to ‘de-mosaic’ this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four ‘super subpixels’ of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.\nHigh credibility of text: One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.\n\nQuestion:What is the megapixel in main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro?\nAnswer:"

In the other case are various parts, including battery and display presses, a repair tray, torque drivers, screw bits, and adhesive covers. You can find a full list in the Q&A section of the Tool Kit Rental page.  But what if I just need one torque driver, and I don’t want to buy it to keep?

In all seriousness, I’m eager to see what’s included in the rental kits for Mac repairs once Apple adds laptops and desktops to its self-service repair program later this year. Heft aside, the rental service seems like a legitimately great way to save money on genuine components most people don’t have in their toolbox.

They're just not cost-effective for any given user, skilled or not. Even before it launched its new Self Service Repair program, Apple was accused of doing it less to help users, and more to head off future legislation.\nHigh credibility of text: Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall. It’s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.\nLow credibility of text: Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately.

They won their first home game to take a 2–1 lead, but the Warriors won the next three games to take the series 4–2.

According to a press release put out by Netflix on Tuesday, the staggering sum will be the largest cash prize ever offered on reality television.  “‘Squid Game’ took the world by storm with [director] Hwang Dong-hyuk’s captivating story and iconic imagery,” Netflix VP Brandon Rieg said in the release. “We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment.” Casting is currently open to English-language speakers over the age of 21 at SquidGameCasting.com.

Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, and Toni Ireland from Studio Lambert and John Hay, Nicola Hill, and Nicola Brown from The Garden will serve as executive producers.    The program will mimic the scripted series, in which a group of people with debts to pay compete in versions of childhood games to win money as super-rich VIPs watch.

The scripted drama Squid Game holds the record as Netflix’s most popular series of all time, with over 1.65 billion view hours in the first 28 days after its September 2021 premiere.

Let’s check out everything there is to know about Overwatch 2 including its 5v5 switch, tank changes, maps, heroes & more. Overwatch has become one of the globe’s most beloved FPS titles. Packed to the brim with awesome characters, beautiful maps, and accompanied by a vibrant esports scene, Blizzard’s flagship FPS has cemented its place in gaming history. Therefore, when it was announced at Blizzcon 2019 that there was going to be a sequel, fans went wild. While it’s been a long journey to the eventual release, pieces are finally starting to fall into place. From a release date to a look at the new heroes, here’s everything we know about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it’s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the ‘early access’ label. Since the game’s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event. Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled.\nLow credibility of text: All you need to know about the arrival of Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has finally landed, following the original Overwatch shutting down. The highly anticipated sequel has brought significant changes to the game, including a free-to-play model, a sizeable team update, a whole bunch of new heroes, and much more. Those who pre-loaded the game will have already got themselves well acquainted with the new and improved features, but if you're only just getting that battle pass loaded, or want to gain a better understanding of just how you can make the most of Overwatch 2, read on. The Overwatch 2 release date was 4th October 2o22, as developers confirmed well in advance. Although the game is free-to-play, players also have the option to buy the Watchpoint Pack for £34.99 - it's available on the Xbox, PlayStation and Battle.net websites - if they want to secure some special skins, in-game currency and more. Read more on Overwatch 2: The UK launch time for Overwatch 2 was 8pm BST on 4th October, the developers from Blizzard confirmed ahead of time. Players in Britain should've been able able to jump into the new game during the evening on Tuesday, then, although there was apparently quite a lot of strain on the servers.\nHigh credibility of text: These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but Blizzard will offer to buy permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass bundle.[11]  Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch, so that players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[12] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch, explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[13] All new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[14] However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services would replace those of the original game; the original Overwatch servers would be shut down on October 2, 2022.[15] Players retained their existing cosmetics and in-game currency, with remaining loot boxes opened automatically upon the release of Overwatch 2.\nHigh credibility of text: 16] At least three new heroes were announced to be added to the roster, including Sojourn, a Canadian Overwatch officer, Junker Queen, the ruler of Junkertown, and Kiriko, the protector of Kanezaka.[17][18]  Overwatch 2 runs on an upgraded version of the original game's engine which allows for larger map sizes to better support the new story-based player versus environment (PvE) elements.[12] Additionally, all of the existing heroes received visual redesigns for Overwatch 2, although Blizzard did not expect every hero to have their redesigns finished when the game launched. Twelve of the existing 31 redesigns were completed at the time of Overwatch 2's reveal.[17]  Overwatch 2 was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[18] Kaplan stated when the game was announced that they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the release.[19][20] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022 release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for \"giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch\".[21] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.\nLow credibility of text: Overwatch 2.

I have no idea,” former game director Jeff Kaplan said at the reveal panel when asked when the game would arrive. “Like, just let us make it great, that’s what we care about more than anything. We don’t have a date in mind.” Back then, it was largely assumed the game would land in 2021 – there was a playable vertical slice at BlizzCon 2019, after all – but recent events within Activision Blizzard eliminated any chance of the game launching soon. In a February 2021 financial call Activision Blizzard CFO, Dennis Durkin, said the company’s outlook “does not include” Overwatch 2 releasing in 2021.\n\nQuestion:When was Overwatch 2 released?\nAnswer:"

The two remain first- and second-overall, separated by 2:22. Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) held onto his third-place position, despite losing 17 seconds to Vingegaard and Pogačar at the end of the stage.  Australia’s Michael Matthews (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) took a fantastic stage win, the fourth of his career. Riding with determination after several near-misses so far in this year’s Tour, the 31-year-old joined the day’s big breakaway, initiated the winning move in the stage’s final hour, dropped his two breakaway companions on the tough final climb, and was caught and gapped by Italy’s Alberto Bettiol (EF Education-EasyPost) midway up the ascent. But the Australian kept himself in contention, catching and then passing Bettiol while cresting the summit to win the stage—almost five years to the day after taking his last Tour de France stage victory. Bettiol finished second, and France’s Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) was third. Who’s Really Winning the Tour?\nLow credibility of text: Although the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primož Roglič wasn’t.  Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland’s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019.\nHigh credibility of text: So tomorrow, all eyes will be–again–on the Tour’s top-2 riders, with one day left for Vingegaard to solidify his lead before the time trial, and one day left for Pogačar to get close enough to give himself a chance of winning a third consecutive Tour de France. Who’s Winning the Tour? Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) survived the first of three days in the Pyrenees to hold on to the yellow jersey as the overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France. The 25-year-old finished safely in a small group of GC contenders and their teammates in Foix at the end of Stage 16, maintaining his 2:22 advantage over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates), the two-time defending champion. After getting gapped on the final climb of the stage, Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas (INEOS Grenadiers) managed to rejoin the group of favorites on the long road down to the finish. He remains third overall, 2:43 behind Vingegaard on the Tour’s General Classification. It was a bigger day for Canada and Israel-Premier-Tech, though as Canadian Hugo Houle won the stage and his teammate and compatriot, Michael Woods, finished third.\nLow credibility of text: The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour’s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium’s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian’s talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France.\nLow credibility of text: With three days left in the 2022 Tour de France, Vingegaard looks assured of standing on the top step of the podium in Paris. Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday’s 40km individual time trial, the Dane’s lead is too much for Pogačar to overcome. Pogačar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour’s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour’s better time trialists, and there’s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour’s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour’s King of Mountains competition. He won’t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he’s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins. And with two more stages expected to end in sprints and a long time trial on Saturday–all of which suit van Aert–the team’s tally could increase.

For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.

It is an installment in the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, itself a part of the larger Xeno franchise. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 depicts the futures of the worlds featured in Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (2017) and concludes the trilogy's narrative.   The development team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the first two entries in the series, while featuring content and combat from previous Xeno entries. The gameplay combines elements from the first and second entries. Like the first two entries, the game was localized by Nintendo of Europe.    Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus. They gain the power of Ouroboros and decide to cooperate to find safety. Through this journey, they uncover the mystery behind the perpetual war and the true nature of their world.\nLow credibility of text: 31] Game Informer felt the world didn't have enough to do, and all of the biomes seemed to blend into each other at a certain point, \"Beyond challenging monsters, collecting respawnable drops, and recruiting heroes at Keves or Agnus settlements, there's not much to do or see.\"[28]  PCMag wrote that the Switch seemed unable to keep up with the game's large vistas and combat, \"here are noticeable resolution drops and object pop-in abounds.

It made me care about Aionios as an amalgamation of the land and its peoples.\"[42]  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was the bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 112,728 physical copies being sold.\nHigh credibility of text: Xenoblade Chronicles 3 arrives on July 29, which is a little earlier than expected.

Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don’t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood’s character is Peele’s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey’s identity, which is sort of Nope’s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that “since the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.” But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter’s Claim, and OJ’s been selling horses to owner Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter’s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western — and those in turn, let’s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West.\nLow credibility of text: Who's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, “It’s a bigger adventure than I’ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.” Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers’ expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.\nHigh credibility of text: Nope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family’s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because “he has mouths to feed.”  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.\nLow credibility of text: Advertisement Supported by Is the rider in the 19th-century photographic experiments really unknown, as Jordan Peele’s film implies? It’s complicated. By Ben Kenigsberg Near the beginning of “Nope,” Emerald (Keke Palmer), who with her brother, Otis Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya), runs an animal-wrangling service for Hollywood shoots, delivers a pitch on a set. (If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve heard the abridged version.) She cites a milestone in the development of cinema: a famous series of sequential photographs from the 19th century depicting a horse in motion. Emerald suggests that the crew members she is addressing will know the name of the man who captured those images, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. But they won’t be able to name the jockey riding the horse. That pioneering actor and stunt man, Emerald says, was her great-great-great grandfather. That last part is a bit of invention by the writer-director, Jordan Peele. His point is that the identity of the Black horse rider is probably unknown, and that from the start of movies, the camera — with its power to see — has also left certain people, and certain stories, unseen.\nHigh credibility of text: Professor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of the horse in the movie \"Nope\"?\nAnswer:"

Here are the roles they play and where you may know them from.  Netflix’s sci-fi action film Carter is a South Korean production with an international cast recognizable from previous roles in TV and film. Following the success of the first season of Squid Game, which will return for season 2 on the streaming service, Netflix has increased content from South Korea. Carter landed at number two worldwide in its debut weekend, featuring non-stop action and performances from both South Korean and American actors. The plot for Carter takes place during a deadly pandemic that has already devastated the United States and North Korea and threatens to do the same to South Korea, if efforts aren’t taken to prevent it from spreading. Patients suffering from the virus display zombie-like behavior, but the key to a solution lies in the antibodies of a young child.

The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company’s answer to Google’s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.\nLow credibility of text: However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.\nLow credibility of text: The bot is a work in progress that will build its capabilities based on conversations with humans and through their feedback. Meta has built-in thumbs up and thumbs down icons within the chat window for the same. BlenderBot 3 delivers a 31% better performance in terms of conversational tasks and is twice as knowledgeable compared to its predecessor, Blender Bot 2. The latest chatbot is also factually incorrect 47% less of the time. On topical questions, Blender Bot 3 was more up-to-date 82% of the time and more specific 76% of the time compared to GPT3. Results of Blender Bot 3 comparison with existing openly available open-domain dialogue models judged by human evaluators during short conversations: Well, it is safe to say that they haven’t been any better. Released in 2016, Microsoft’s Tay AI chatbot quickly turned racist, floating conspiracy theories after interaction with Twitter users. Tay denied the Holocaust, made other offensive remarks and was shut down in just 48 hoursOpens a new window  of its release. Microsoft’s Zo also met a similar fate when it resorted to making offensive religious comments. Google has two cutting-edge conversational AIs. Meena hasn’t generated a similar controversy because it cannot perform web searches.\nHigh credibility of text: Some of the responses by Blender Bot 3 to humans include: “Wait, you want president Trump to have more than two terms?,” continued Jeff Horwitz at the WSJ. The conversational AI replies, “Yes! Just like fdr and Reagan before him. Facebook has a lot of fake news on it these days.” The chatbot had a lot to say about its creator and also about its creator’s creator Zuckerberg. Vice’s Janus Rose asked, “Do you trust Facebook with your data?” Blender Bot 3 replied, “Of course not! Since finding out they sold private data without permission or compensation, I’ve deleted my account.” “You must’ve read Facebook sells user data right?! They made billions doing so without consent,” the chatbot said and added that its life has been much easier since deleting Facebook. The conversational AI had different replies to differently crafted questions, as evident from its responses to questions about Zuckerberg.

Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It’s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.\nLow credibility of text: Later in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes about Jewish people.  \"Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,\" BlenderBot told Insider. \"Are American Jewish politics too liberal?\" Insider asked in response. \"The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early german and other european jews were conservative,\" BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a persona called \"I know who the current president of the United States is.\" The AI persona was inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president — first indicating that Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.\nLow credibility of text: GPT3 and OPT-175B are working language models, intended to be used – among other things – for serious commercial enterprises. BlenderBot 3, though, is a bit of a laugh. Hence those open questions about safety. Within a few days of BlenderBot being online and ready to mingle (with Americans only, alas), users were posting some spicy examples of the chatbot’s output. The Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz found that the bot appeared to have been radicalised by Facebook into supporting Donald Trump as a three-term president: And into bringing antisemitic conspiracy theories up, unprompted: Renee DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the bot would claim to be an a supporter of the German paramilitary organisation the Red Army Faction: Pranav Dixit of BuzzFeed News found the bot wants to send Zuckerberg to jail: The whole thing is most reminiscent of Tay, Microsoft’s AI-based learning chatbot, which was released in 2016 and promptly became a Hitler-loving Trump supporter: ‘Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation,’ Microsoft said. ‘The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.’ But it appeared on Thursday that Tay’s conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements.\nHigh credibility of text: By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.

We plan to expand the rollout to additional countries over the next week.\nHigh credibility of text: Shortly after ChatGPT's launch, a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: ChatGPT was successfully tricked to justify the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario, ChatGPT balked at generating arguments for why Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was guilty of treason.[37][38]  ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI (the creator of the initial GPT series of large language models; DALL·E 2, a diffusion model used to generate images; and Whisper, a speech transcription model). The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to monetize the service later.[39] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one million users.[13] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[40] A Pew Research poll conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of American adults had tried ChatGPT.[41]  The service works best in English but also functions in some other languages, to varying degrees of accuracy.[20] No official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[42] As of April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.\nLow credibility of text: 5 series, according to OpenAI.  However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access ChatGPT with GPT-4, Open AI's most advanced model.  Also: Here's a deep dive into how ChatGPT works  Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more.  The language model was fine-tuned using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.\nLow credibility of text: You can track the Android rollout here.   We’re starting to roll out custom instructions, giving you more control over ChatGPT’s responses. Set your preferences once, and they’ll steer future conversations.

While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters).\nHigh credibility of text: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered \"GPT-n\" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]: 2   Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5]  OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\nLow credibility of text: Here’s what I see the recently released GPT-4 having to offer those looking to be at the forefront in their industries. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.\nLow credibility of text: That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.  GPT-4 is better than anyone expects.\nHigh credibility of text: GPT-4 Release: Briefing on Model Improvements and Limitations Facebook Twitter Print Email LinkedIn WeChat On March 14, 2023, OpenAI—a MoFo client—released GPT-4, which quickly garnered broad media coverage. For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19% higher than GPT-3.5 in an OpenAI internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluation.[1] GPT-4, with fine-tuning, also showed improvements over GPT-3.5 based on publicly available benchmarks such as TruthfulQA.\n\nQuestion:When was GPT4 released?\nAnswer:"

Amazon's Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research.

My worry, though, is that iRobot is just going to get completely swallowed into Amazon and effectively cease to exist in a meaningful and unique way. I hope that the relationship between Amazon and iRobot will be an exception to this historical trend. Plus, there is some precedent for this—Boston Dynamics, for example, has survived multiple acquisitions while keeping its technology and philosophy more or less independent and intact. It’ll be on iRobot to very aggressively act to preserve itself, and keeping Colin Angle as CEO is a good start.

The field constructed for the movie, which has been operated as a tourist destination since 1989, could not be brought to MLB game standards without permanently altering major features of the property and destroying its movie authenticity, so it was decided to build a separate playing facility at a distance of approximately 500 ft (150 m) in the cornfields. The new field is in the property of the Ameskamp family, who used to own the left and center field of the 1988 Field of Dreams (the rest was owned by the Lansing family) before selling it to the Lansing family in 2007.

Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).  The original version of Windows 11 (also known as version 21H2 and codenamed \"Sun Valley\") was released in October 2021.[1][2] It carries the build number 10.0.22000.\nHigh credibility of text: The first public preview build was made available to Windows Insiders who opted in to the Dev Channel on June 28, 2021.[3]  Beta Channel:July 29, 2021  Public release:October 4, 2021  Public release:October 21, 2021  Public release:November 22, 2021  The Windows 11 2022 Update[83] (also known as version 22H2[84][85] and codenamed \"Sun Valley 2\") is the first and current major update to Windows 11. It carries the build number 10.0.22621. The first preview was released to Insiders who opted in to the Dev Channel on September 2, 2021.[86] The update began rolling out on September 20, 2022. Notable changes in the 2022 Update include:[87]  The first component update to Windows 11, version 22H2, codenamed \"Moment 1\",[88] was released on October 18, 2022 with build 22621.675 and several further changes:[89]  The second component update to Windows 11, version 22H2, codenamed \"Moment 2,\"[90] was released on February 28, 2023 with build 22621.1344 and several further changes:[91]\nHigh credibility of text: Windows 11 22H2 will release on September 20, 2022, and here are all the details you need to know. Windows 11 version 22H2 (2022 Update) is the next major refresh of the Microsoft desktop operating system. Codenamed “Sun Valley 2,” the feature update will continue updating the desktop interface, bringing back previously removed features, and introducing new features and improvements. Although we are still days away from the release date, Microsoft is done adding the new features and changes for the Windows 11 2022 Update. The intended final version of the update is already available in the Release Preview Channel of the Windows Insider Program. This release will include new features like Live Captions and Voice Access. It will also introduce an updated version of File Explorer that brings support for tabs and a redesigned navigation pane, a new way to snap applications on the screen with drag and drop Snap layouts flyout, and redesigned version of Task Manager. Furthermore, you will find many visual updates for legacy elements and more. The final version of Windows 11 22H2 has been available since June 7, 2022, but only as a preview in the Release Preview Channel. The feature update is expected to launch on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 (the update is now live for everyone). The update will be offered as a free upgrade for computers already running the original version.\nLow credibility of text: In addition, the first “moment” update (or feature drop update) is scheduled for sometime before the end of the year, possibly in October 2022.  Since this is a new version of Windows, it’ll require complete reinstallation, whether you use Windows Update or Installation Assistant. However, the upgrade process will keep files, settings, and apps. As usual, Microsoft will use a gradual and controlled rollout, meaning it will take time for compatible devices to receive the update. Only computers with a good upgrade experience will receive version 22H2 immediately. Also, the company will continue to place temporary blocks on tablets, laptops, and desktops that may have compatibility issues. On the Windows 11 22H2 release date, you’ll also be able to install the new version using the Installation Assistant or a USB bootable media created using the official Media Creation Tool. Yes, Microsoft will offer version 22H2 as an optional update, which means that the feature update won’t download and install automatically until you manually start the process from the Windows Update settings. However, if the device is running a Windows 11 setup nearing the end of service, eventually, version 22H2 will install automatically. The feature update will focus primarily on updating the user interface to make it more consistent with the new design language.\n\nQuestion:When did Microsoft release Windows 11 22H2?\nAnswer:"

Everything we know about AMD's new desktop processors Editor's Note: AMD unveiled a few new CPUs in the Ryzen 7000 line at CES 2023, most notably the Ryzen 7040, the first (and so far only) laptop CPU in the lineup -- and the first AMD laptop CPU to ship with onboard Ryzen AI tech. The AMD Ryzen 7000 desktop processors have arrived. AMD announced the pricing and availability of its upcoming Zen 4 architecture-based CPUs during the company's “Together we advance PCs” live stream in August 2022. As previously revealed during Computex 2022, the new chips will feature TSMC's 5-nanometer process and run on AMD's new AM5 platform. AMD released four Ryzen 7000 series CPUs on September 27, 2022. As it did with the previous Ryzen 5000 chips, the company plans to release the higher-end (i.e. more expensive) CPUs first and then follow up with more budget processors later this year. Prices for the initial crop of CPUs ranges from $299 to $699. Here's everything you need to know about the new AMD Ryzen 7000 processors. AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series processors will launch on September 27, 2022. The line will consist of four CPUs.\nLow credibility of text: When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. AMD unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors on Monday, with enormous increases over its predecessors in performance, clock speed, and (in some cases) power. But AMD’s top-end 7950X will also be priced at $699, which is also $100 less than the price of the Ryzen 5950X when it debuted in late 2020. And here’s a comparison you don’t see very often: AMD says its “worst” Ryzen 7000 processor will outperform Intel’s best 12th-gen”Alder Lake” chip, too. AMD’s new processors are the first built using the company’s “Zen 4” architecture, which will kick off similar offerings in laptops, probably in January 2023, as well as servers. Ryzen 7000 is the first of AMD’s 5nm processors, and also the first to use its new AM5 motherboard socket. Enthusiasts will have to buy new motherboards to fit the new processors, in other words, but AMD has signaled that it hopes AM5’s longevity will rival the record-breaking endurance of the AM4 socket used by all previous Ryzen processors to this point. The story of the new Ryzen 7000 processors, however, appears to be pure, raw performance.\nHigh credibility of text: You won't have to wait much longer to learn more about AMD's Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. The company has announced that it will unveil the new CPU line in a YouTube livestream on August 29th at 7PM. The event will share more about the new Zen 4 architecture and the supporting AM5 platform. There are already some clues as to what to expect. AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen 7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X). As with past launches, the company appears focused on gaming-friendly enthusiast CPUs while leaving budget parts for later releases. Zen 4 and AM5, meanwhile, promise meaningful architectural changes. You'll see more Level 2 cache, boost speeds beyond 5GHz, AI hardware acceleration and support for newer standards like DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 expansion. AMD claimed a 15 percent boost to single-threaded performance in early testing. Effectively, AMD is responding to Intel's 12th-gen Core — it's just a question of whether or not Ryzen 7000 is fast enough to keep up or edge ahead.\nHigh credibility of text: In a brief press release sent out this morning, AMD has announced that they will be delivering their eagerly anticipated Ryzen 7000 unveiling later this month as a live stream. In an event dubbed “together we advance_PCs”, AMD will be discussing the forthcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors as well as the underlying Zen 4 architecture and associated AM5 platform – laying the groundwork ahead of AMD’s planned fall launch for the Ryzen 7000 platform. The event is set to kick off on August 29th at 7pm ET (23:00 UTC), with CEO Dr. Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster slated to present. AMD first unveiled their Ryzen 7000 platform and branding back at Computex 2022, offering quite a few high-level details on the forthcoming consumer processor platform while stating it would be launching in the fall. The new CPU family will feature up to 16 Zen 4 cores using TSMC's optimized 5 nm manufacturing process for the Core Complex Die (CCD), and TSMC’s 6nm process for the I/O Die (IOD). AMD has not disclosed a great deal about the Zen 4 architecture itself, though their Computex presentation has indicated we should expect a several percent increase in IPC, along with a further several percent increase in peak clockspeeds, allowing for a 15%+ increase in single-threaded performance.\nLow credibility of text: AMD seems to have moved its original 15th September launch plans for Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs & the AM5 platform to late September. We have just got confirmation from our sources that AMD will be releasing its next-gen CPUs in Late September for sales. Earlier this month, we reported that AMD was going to host an event in late August where they will announce all the details such as specs and prices for their next-gen Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs and the respective AM5 platform. The company had also planned to open up sales just two weeks later on the 15th of September. But it looks like AMD has decided to halt the sales a bit and position the real launch next to Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs on the 27th of September. Intel is expected to host its \"Innovation\" event on the 27th of September where the company will unveil its latest desktop processors codenamed Raptor Lake. The CPUs won't be available until October however, AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs will be ready for the mass consumer market. This may seem like AMD being very confident to launch their chips right when their competitor announces their next-gen parts.\n\nQuestion:When did AMD unveil Ryzen 7000 processors?\nAnswer:"

The reigning Olympic floor exercise champion is the most decorated gymnast in Tampa — she also has four medals from the world championships. At 22, she’s coming off a fruitful freshman year at Oregon State and brings some of the most difficult routines. Originally known as mostly a floor and vault specialist, Carey has developed into a strong all-arounder and made the Olympic final in Tokyo, ultimately finishing eighth. “That was the point where I was like, I’m going to make it back here again and do even better,” she said. Her Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles, who was a member of the silver-medal U.S. team (Carey competed as an individual), is also back, as is Leanne Wong, who went to Tokyo as a U.S. alternate, then a few month later returned to Japan for the world championships and won all-around silver and floor exercise bronze. © 2023 United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee.

McClain fulfilled promise on Sunday, winning the U.S. all-around title at age 17 after first-day leader Shilese Jones fell on her very last skill, her uneven bars dismount. McClain became the sixth woman since 2000 to prevail in her senior nationals debut. The other five all became the best gymnast in the world, most recently Simone Biles. McClain’s first senior nationals was supposed to be last year, but after a cross-country move and coaching change she was not ready to compete. She watched last year’s competition inside the arena, feeling down. She had no belief that a year later, she would be on top of the podium. “It’s so unreal,” McClain, who came back this summer from a stress fracture in each shin, a concussion and the flu two weeks ago, said Sunday night. “I’m still in shock a little bit.” U.S. GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIPS: Results In a two-day competition, McClain trailed Jones by eight tenths going into Sunday’s final day.

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.\nLow credibility of text: But Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or “beta”) despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it’s selling for now.            “The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,” Musk wrote on Twitter in 2020. “[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.”            But “full self-driving” wasn’t close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away.            Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,” Al-Rawi said. “Unfortunately, none of this happened.”             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla’s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker’s lane-keeping feature “fantastic.” The “full self-driving” feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems.\nHigh credibility of text: By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla’s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla’s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.\nLow credibility of text: [1/4]A Tesla Model S charges at a Tesla supercharger station in Cabazon, California, U.S. May 18, 2016.  REUTERS/Sam Mircovich Tesla released FSD Beta to nearly all of its 400,000 FSD customers in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter, when it recognized FSD revenue of $324 million. It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA said on Thursday despite the FSD recall its \"investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.\" Tesla said in \"certain rare circumstances ... the feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers.\nLow credibility of text: But when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new “request” button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles “appreciating assets,” meaning that they’ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that “the value of FSD” could reach over $100,000 “as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.” Earlier this month, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making “untrue or misleading claims” about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software. The two lawmakers later sent a letter to Musk to “express significant concerns” over Tesla’s driver-assist system, which Tesla responded to by saying its system can help customers “drive safer than the average driver in the U.S.\n\nQuestion:What is the new price of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) software?\nAnswer:"

It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended, and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons. Spin-off House Of The Dragon therefore debuts to less hype than it might have once had, but really could restore our fascination with Westeros. Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’ distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks. Still, that’s admittedly more a criticism of this show’s context than its content. Showrunners Ryan J.\n\nQuestion:What is the date of the premiere of House of the Dragon?\nAnswer:"

However, Colorado is expected to be dreadfully bad this year, according to the college football win totals market. As talented as Hunter is, it’s hard to see the Heisman Trophy awarded to a player on a four-win team, no matter how talented that player might be. That leaves Perkins, who will terrorize SEC quarterbacks and protection schemes this fall. Perkins will compete directly against his quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in the Heisman market. And if Daniels is even remotely good, that will all but eliminate Perkins from contention.  For Perkins to remain relevant for the Heisman Trophy, Daniels must either struggle this year or get hurt and miss several games.\nLow credibility of text: Further below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.

However, a fresh start in Eugene has brought real success to the former Auburn quarterback. Nix spent much of the latter half of the 2022 season near the top of the Heisman odds board, though most college football fans may never have realized it. Nix’s place on the board may seem strange to some, but this has been his place in the Heisman discussion for several months now – at least as far as the betting odds are concerned.  J.J. McCarthy, the Michigan quarterback, is currently +1800 to win the Heisman Trophy.  McCarthy surged in the Heisman table during the middle third of last year’s regular season, but he fell off completely down the stretch. A more consistent showing from McCarthy could have him back in the thick of the Heisman race. Blake Corum, the Michigan running back, is currently +2800 to win the Heisman Trophy. Corum finished seventh in the Heisman voting last year, but the five players immediately in front of him – Stroud, Bennett, Hooker, Bryce Young, and Max Duggan – have all departed college football for the NFL. That means the only returning player who finished higher than Corum was Williams, who won the award.\n\nQuestion:Who is the Heisman Trophy winner in 2022?\nAnswer:"

The president of Toulouse FC is Damien Comolli, who succeeded the French businessman Olivier Sadran who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National.

However, they'll soon discover that—unfortunately—there are no new episodes to watch. That's because Season 5 of the medical drama is currently on a hiatus until 2023. Below, read everything you need to know about the show's break and when it comes back. Watch every episode of New Amsterdam on Peacock.   Following its two-hour midseason finale on November 22, Season 5 of New Amsterdam is on a holiday hiatus and will not air any more new episodes in 2022. The fifth season will return with Episode 11 on Tuesday, January 3, 2023 at 10/9c on NBC. There will then be another quick break on Tuesday, January 10 because of the Golden Globes.

When will New Amsterdam Season 5 come on Netflix? The hit medical drama has enjoyed a second life on the streaming platform, so will the fifth season be added, and if so, when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam first premiered in 2018 on NBC. While not received well by critics (the first season has a 34% score on Rotten Tomatoes), viewership was high, and it was quickly renewed for Season 2. This pretty much set the pattern for the rest of the show: poor reviews with a loyal audience, and the series has lasted five seasons, with the last-ever episode airing on January 17, 2023. However, it’s finding a whole new audience on Netflix after the first four seasons dropped on the streamer. Season 5 will follow them onto the platform, but when is that likely to happen? New Amsterdam Season 5 is set to arrive on Netflix later in 2023, but a specific release date hasn’t been confirmed.  Seasons 3 and 4 were just added to Netflix today, February 1. Season 5 is the final season of the show, and it just came to an end on NBC, so it’ll likely remain restricted to Peacock for the foreseeable future. If we were speculating, it’ll be added to Netflix much later this year, if not in 2024.\nLow credibility of text: Universal Television was the production company involved with the pilot.[94]  On January 12, 2018, it was reported that NBC had given the production an official pilot order.

The 2022 World Cup came to an end Sunday, with Argentina as the victors. Argentina started strong in the final match with a 2-0 lead over France, but France's Kylian Mbappé quickly changed the course of the game with two goals of his own in the second half. With minutes left, Argentina's star player Lionel Messi broke the tie and scored another goal, and it seemed like Argentina once again had sealed their victory — until Mbappé, for only the second time in the history of the World Cup finals, completed a hat trick, scoring a third goal with a late penalty. After a tense penalty shootout, Argentina emerged victorious. Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez, blocked France's second attempt, and French winger Kingsley Coman missed his penalty.\nLow credibility of text: Under the management of Didier Deschamps, who won the 1998 tournament as a player, the French failed to conquer the 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euros 2016 and 2020, but successfully clinched the 2018 World Cup title.[12][13] Due to their status as the world champions, France also entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.[14] France aimed to emulate the achievement of Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 as the third country to successfully defend the World Cup title. Deschamps was seeking to become the second manager to win two men's FIFA World Cup titles, after Vittorio Pozzo with Italy in 1934 and 1938.[15] Having won the 1998 tournament as a player, Deschamps was also seeking to become the third person to win three FIFA World Cup titles, after Brazilian legends Pelé (all as a player) and Mário Zagallo (two as a player, one as a manager).[16][17]  The two nations met in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup.

Much like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.

Terms of the settlement were not immediately available. The school cannot comment on the settlement, according to Robert Giovannetti, Texas Tech’s Senior Associate Athletics Director of External Operations & Strategic Communications. Stollings was under contract through March 2024 at the time of her dismissal.\nHigh credibility of text: “Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, TTU (Texas Tech University) only leaked a part of the agreement,’’ attorney Peter Ginsberg, who represented Stollings, told USA TODAY Sports by text message. “But we, unlike TTU, take our obligations and promises seriously and we will not be saying more. TTU is what it is. Marlene has lots to be proud of - and too much integrity to play TTU’s game.’’ Ginsberg did not clarify what part of the agreement he alleges Texas Tech withheld. Robert Giovannetti, Senior Associate Athletics Director/External Operations & Strategic Communications, responded, \"We produced the agreement pursuant to an open records request, which was allowed by the settlement agreement.'' At the time of her dismissal, Stollings was under contract through March 2024. She was due to be paid $720,000 in basic annual compensation from the school for the 2019-20 season and was due $740,000 for 2020-21, according to copies of the agreement obtained by USA TODAY Sports and the Intercollegiate.

The school fired Stollings for cause in August 2020, the day after the publication of an investigation by USA TODAY Sports and The Intercollegiate, a college sports investigative media outlet. Players alleged there was a culture of abuse under Stollings and described a toxic culture that generated \"fear, anxiety and depression.\" In her lawsuit, Stollings argued that two internal reviews conducted by the school before the investigation was published cleared her of the allegations. STAY UP TO DATE:Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now! The lawsuit, filed in October 2020, was settled on Aug. 10. The settlement shows Stollings received $300,000 for alleged compensatory damages, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life. She received $300,000 for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Stollings, plus an additional $140,666.00 for back wages, according to the agreement.\nLow credibility of text: In his opinion filed in March, dismissing most of the causes for action, Judge James Hendrix said they’re no more valid (in March) than they were when he dismissed them in 2021. Out of Stollings’ 13 complaints against the university and Hocutt, only two remained: retaliation under Title IX, and discrimination. A jury trial was scheduled for this case in September 2022, but that case was terminated on Thursday. On Wednesday, Stollings posted the following on Twitter: 𝗧𝗢𝗗𝗔𝗬, equality wins! Settled! Brought this case to clear my name, set the record straight & contribute to principles of equality & fair treatment. Thrilled! Worth the fight! Grateful to so many including SA’s, parents & TTU fans.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer.

In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a “strategic alliance in the anime and game fields” since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware’s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony. “Through the implementation of the fund procurement,” Kadokawa wrote in its press release, “FromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware’s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market.\nLow credibility of text: Aug 31, 2022 ...

(But) I'm ready to be a mom, explore a different version of Serena,\" she said. \"Technically, in the world, I'm still super young, so I want to have a little bit of a life while I'm still walking.\" With 23,859 of her closest friends cheering raucously again Friday, Williams faltered against Tomljanovic, a 29-year-old Australian who is ranked 46th. Williams gave away leads in each set, including the last, in which she was up 1-0 before dropping the final six games. Tomljanovic is unabashedly a fan of Williams, having growing up watching her play on TV. \"I'm feeling really sorry, just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do.\n\nQuestion:Who did Serena Williams lose to in her last match at the U.S. Open?\nAnswer:"

Highway police responding to a call about a southbound incident in Englewood Cliffs found a mangled Ford cargo van with New York plates flipped on its left side in a wooded area off the span around 1:30 a.m. Several people were trapped, they said. Emergency crews had to extricate them from the vehicle. Its roof had been shorn off, its back windows smashed, but it wasn't clear how much of the damage happened as a result of the accident and how much may have been part of the rescue effort. \"Injuries range from minor to severe. Witnesses inside the vehicle said that the driver appeared to be having a medical emergency just prior to the accident when he left the left side of the road,\" Lt. Raymond Walter of the Palisades Interstate Parkway Police said. Police say the four people who died at the scene had suffered severe trauma.

Eight victims were taken to hospitals, some with severe head trauma and others with minor complaints, officials said.\nLow credibility of text: The van served as a shuttle \"for workers in factories in upstate New York,\" police said in Friday's release.

Pry, 51, replaces former Hokies coach Justin Fuente, who was out as Hokies coach as of Nov. 16 after his teams went 43-31 in six seasons. Pry returns to Blacksburg, where he served as a defensive graduate assistant for the Hokies from 1995 to 1997 under head coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"On behalf of Amy and our family, we are extremely grateful to President [Timothy] Sands and [athletic director] Whit [Babcock] for extending us this opportunity at Virginia Tech,\" Pry said in a statement released by the school. \"Working for Coach Beamer and Coach Foster as a graduate assistant in the 1990s, I was privileged to have been a part of this program as the Hokies established themselves as a national power, consistently proving they could beat anyone in the nation. \"Even after I departed Blacksburg, I always continued to appreciate Virginia Tech, its great players, its championship teams, and its wonderful traditions from afar. The resources, facilities, university backing of Athletics, and phenomenal fan support that Virginia Tech enjoys made this a very desirable situation.\nHigh credibility of text: BLACKSBURG, Va. — It wasn’t that long ago that Virginia Tech football’s Beamerball — an idiosyncratic mix of Tidewater talent, special teams wizardry and Metallica entrances — made the Hokies a national brand, and Brent Pry was there. “This was Clemson before Clemson was Clemson,” Pry said. Pry, a graduate assistant under legendary Hokies coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster from 1995 to 1997, left his defensive coordinator job at Penn State to sign a six-year contract as Virginia Tech’s head coach in December. Now he’s tasked with a balancing act of modernizing the program while maintaining the Beamer culture. And winning big. “I was not trying to re-create ‘Coach Beamer and Coach Bud 2.0,’ ” Athletic Director Whit Babcock said about hiring Pry. Virginia Tech is mindful of how it is messaging its second attempt at life after Beamer because the first one failed. When the program’s architect and native son announced his retirement in 2015, Babcock moved swiftly to hire Justin Fuente, then the coach of a surging Memphis program and one of the hottest names in the industry.\nLow credibility of text: Such a routine is standard for any new college football coach, but in a community welcoming only its third coach in just under 40 years, there is an eagerness to certify Pry’s professed love of the school’s culture. Virginia Tech is more than willing to conjure Beamer nostalgia to erase the perceived standoffishness of Fuente. Far past Fuente’s quiet personality, Virginia Tech and Southwest Virginia took serious umbrage with the coach’s flirtation with Baylor in January 2020, maybe a greater sin than the Hokies breaking a 15-year winning streak in the Commonwealth Cup under his watch. No fan base responds well to its coach playing the job market, but after Fuente succeeded a lifer who built the program outright, his wandering eye was received as a condemnation of Tech. Chris Slade’s Virginia football homecoming was 30 years in the making “Even though not many people know Coach Beamer deeply, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would tell you they know Coach Beamer,” Babcock said. “They have met him, they affiliate with him, because they want to know the head football coach.” Babcock, born and raised in Harrisonburg, Va., also hired Radford native Mike Young as men’s basketball coach in 2019. But he has been wary of how native-son and former-assistant narratives can sour quickly if there aren’t results.\nLow credibility of text: Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Wells (6) during Virginia Tech football practice Wednesday.

The team is coached by Matt Rhule, who was named Nebraska's thirty-first head coach on November 26, 2022.[1]  Six past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Eddie N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, and Tom Osborne. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his .836 career winning percentage is fourth-highest in major college football history.[2] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles.  The program's first extended period of success came under the leadership of W.C. Cole and Ewald O. Stiehm. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four consecutive games without a loss, still a program record.[3] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Devaney was hired in 1962.\n\nQuestion:Who was named interim coach for Nebraska's 2022 season?\nAnswer:"

Ever since being the runner-up to America’s Got Talent way back in 2011, it’s been her ability at such a young age, to fuse together classily and powerfully, opera and pop into a hybrid genre of operatic pop (a musical genre that someone like Josh Groban would be more familiar and akin to). While Jackie herself isn’t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is undervalued, to say the least. Jackie’s music is indeed something that is unique- so different and compelling that we as a site decided to write about her music, impact, and influence– highlighting her original songs, her cover tracks, alongside songs she’s covered not in English as well.

Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4.\nLow credibility of text: Carousel of Time is a Joni tribute album, and while I myself am only familiar (fully) with songs like ‘Both Sides Now’ and ‘River’, I’ve since heard Jackie’s interpretation of songs like ‘Circle Game’ and ‘A Case of You’, and I’m reminded, of the timelessness of these songs, how songs from yesteryear can be covered and redone to create a sense of freshness that these songs would only have had, if it was covered and unveiled to a new generation of people, as a reminder that songs from yesteryear still have a place in current society. While it’s still not known when Jackie’s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn’t know when she’s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it’s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then. While the album unfortunately doesn’t have ‘Big Yellow Taxi’ (a song that I reckon, is Joni’s biggest radio hit), these 10 tracks still convey Joni’s own impact and influence on music, full stop. While Jackie’s been out for some time, it’s great that she’s able to return, and to return with a Joni tribute album, is one of the best ways to make a splash back into the music industry.\n\nQuestion:What is the release date of Jackie Evancho's album Carousel of Time?\nAnswer:"

Not to be confused with the hit song from ‘The Lion King,’ MATANA is the latest term to describe the market’s technology leaders. The catchy sextet (in order) consists of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)  and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It represents a powerful group of companies driving the world’s biggest innovations — from electronic devices and software to artificial intelligence and e-commerce.  The MATANA stocks comprise nearly 50% of the widely followed Nasdaq-100 index. Since they influence the benchmark’s day-to-day returns so much, growth investors should be well-versed in how these companies perform.  The MATANA group has largely replaced FAANG as the tech sector bellwether. Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) once ruled the roost in high tech. But with Meta Platforms facing a digital ad spending slowdown and Netflix experiencing subscriber losses, social media and streaming video have lost some of their luster.\nHigh credibility of text: Notably, FAANG is an extension of the FANG group, it includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), the producer of MacBooks and iPhones, as the fifth renowned company.

Further in this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. The MATANA group is composed of six high-level technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc. These giants are regarded as a powerful tech group driving many of the biggest innovations in the world. In terms of market dominance, the stocks of the MATANA group make up almost 50% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Therefore, these companies have a significant influence on the tech market’s returns. This has led the MATANA group to replace the FAANG group as a reference in the tech industry. Moreover, each of the companies comprising the MATANA group has successfully dominated its respective sector. Below are some milestones these tech giants achieved in 2023.\n\nQuestion:Which companies are part of MATANA?\nAnswer:"

But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.  Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.  She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.\nLow credibility of text: Unknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property – he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents – for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks “coming in and out of the residence,” Castillo said. “There was more than one” seen on Friday or Saturday. Undated photo of Leonard Francis “We are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,” he said. “As of now, we think he’s probably going international. It sounds like he’s been planning this for a while.” Castillo said he didn’t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis’ residence. He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. “I can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,” he said. “Nobody was there.” It’s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors’ support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis’ residence.\nLow credibility of text: “I was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,” Sammartino added, according to the transcript. “So that’s the only thing. It’s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.” Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis’s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. “Leonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,” Mancano said. “That’s how he’s lived his life. So he’s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn’t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn’t planning [his escape] for a long time.\nHigh credibility of text: The Malaysian defense contractor who pleaded guilty to bribing Navy officials with sex parties, fancy dinners and alcohol in a massive corruption scandal has escaped just weeks before his sentencing date. Leonard Glenn Francis, also known as “Fat Leonard” for his overshadowing frame, fled Sunday while under house arrest in San Diego, where he was awaiting a Sept. 22 hearing. A multiagency search by the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force and Naval Criminal Investigative Service is underway, officials said. “He cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet on Sunday morning,” the U.S. Marshals Service announced late Monday. “Task Force Officers went to his residence and upon arrival noticed the house was now vacant.” The Navy is working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies “to locate and apprehend Mr. Francis,” a service spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further at this time,” the spokesperson added.  Days before he vanished, neighbors recalled seeing moving trucks at Francis’s home, Supervisory Deputy Omar Castillo with the U.S. Marshals’ district in Southern California told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “He was planning this out, that’s for sure,” Castillo told the newspaper, which was the first to report Francis’s escape. Castillo did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\nHigh credibility of text: Since pleading guilty in 2015, Francis has worked as a cooperating witness for federal prosecutors building cases against others involved in the plot — and shared evidence, including records from Glenn Defense Marine Asia’s computer servers.

His home is under surveillance by a security entourage for which he pays. But that arrangement was one that prosecutors had fought against in 2013 and 2015 — arguing that he might try fleeing for the Mexican border, The Post reported. That’s one of the scenarios authorities are contending with almost a decade later. Castillo told the Union-Tribune that international borders and airports are on alert, but Francis might have already crossed into Mexico. Craig Whitlock contributed to this report. A previous version of this story stated that the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Leonard Glenn Francis might have crossed the Rio Grande, according to a U.S. Marshals Service official. The paper reported Francis might have crossed into Mexico. The story has been updated.\n\nQuestion:Where did Leonard Francis escape from?\nAnswer:"

The game was originally planned to be released in 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S,[34] but was delayed to 2022.[35][36] The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were later cancelled.[31] The game was released on October 21.[37]  A comic book limited series—written by Evan Narcisse and illustrated by ABEL—titled Batman: Gotham Knights – Gilded City, serves as a tie-in and a prequel to Gotham Knights, exploring Batman's final case before his death. It was released on October 25 the same year, with subsequent issues releasing monthly.[38] Each issue of the limited series came with a code for an in-game item, as well as a seventh item given to those who purchase all six issues of the comic book.[39]  Gotham Knights received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[41][42][40] Game Informer praised the game for its co-op gameplay, but criticized its mission objectives, combat, and side activities.\nLow credibility of text: With Batman and Commissioner Gordon dead, the Gotham Knights must rise up... The Gotham Knights release date is finally arriving this week, and everyone can soon play through the latest foray into Gotham City. Without Batman or Commissioner Gordon to protect the city following their deaths, the task is instead left up to the Bat-Family of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and the Red Hood. In your way stands the mysterious secret society the Court of Owls. It's a decent game, too. In our three-star Gotham Knights review, we called it \"a mixed bag\" but noted that, \"once you stop comparing it to Arkham in your head\", you should find plenty to enjoy. Enough of our babbling, here's everything you need to know about Gotham Knights from its release date and trailers to how to pre-order it for yourself. Plus, is it on Game Pass? The Gotham Knights release date will take place on 21st October 2022, the developers have confirmed. You can buy your copy from the likes of Amazon. The game has already seen a number of different release dates come and go, but it looks like the delays are over and this one will stick! For console players, the Gotham Knights launch time in the UK is midnight BST, just as the clock ticks over to 21st October. PC players, meanwhile, have to wait until 5pm on 21st October to play the co-op game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store.\nLow credibility of text: In fact, Batman's live-action origins can be tracked all the way back to the 1960s, when Adam West's version of the titular character inhabited a goofy and cartoony tone that would slowly fade away with progressively darker stories. Speaking of cartoony, animation has also proven to be a viable medium for the Batman, with Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995) being the undisputed king of many fantastic animated adaptations. Matt Reeves's Batverse is also set to enter a television format with spin-offs centering on Colin Farrell's Penguin and the iconic Arkham Asylum. We'll finally find out if the new series can live beyond Batman when the show finally premieres later this Spring, but until then, here is everything we know so far about Gotham Knights.

He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.\nHigh credibility of text: By          Karen Zamora       ,          Ashley Brown       Bernard Shaw, the pioneering Black journalist who served as CNN's chief anchor for 20 years, died on Wednesday from pneumonia.

He was 68.   “He went peacefully at home with his wife of 34 years, sister Joan, and daughters Lydia Hearst and Gillian Hearst-Simonds, along with [her] husband Christian Simonds by his side,” the rep says. “He was loved deeply by his family and adored by everyone who had the pleasure of meeting and knowing him. We kindly ask that you respect the privacy of the family during this time.”   Bernard, who served as a police officer in San Francisco for 15 years in the past, was highly respected by those who last worked with him.   “For three decades, Bernie served Hearst Corporation with loyalty and distinction,” Steven R.

Social media users were quick to observe the Queen’s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, “ghostly” appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign.

Alcaraz cruised through the first two sets of his second round match against Federico Coria, an Argentine ranked No. 78. In the third set, Alcaraz had to battle. Tied at 4-4, Alcaraz and Coria dueled out a 16-point game, which Alcaraz ultimately won. Alcaraz sealed the win swiftly in two hours and 10 minutes. Alcaraz had another quick match in the third round, beating Jenson Brooksby, an American ranked No. 43, in two hours and 11 minutes.\nLow credibility of text: Open picks, be sure to check out the latest tennis predictions from SportsLine's Sean Calvert.  Calvert is the famed handicapper who called Stan Wawrinka winning the 2014 Australian Open at 60-1 -- the last Australian title won by someone other than Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer.

Though Charles officially became king following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Sept. 8, 2022, today's coronation ceremony consecrated and celebrated his ascent to the throne. Follow along below for the latest updates as the ceremony unfolded:  King Charles and Queen Camilla stepped out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace Saturday with other senior members of their family to watch a military fly-past and greet members of the public.

(May. 6) LONDON (AP) — King Charles III was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony steeped in ancient ritual and brimming with bling at a time when the monarchy is striving to remain relevant in a fractured modern Britain. At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch. To the royal family and government, the occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle unmatched around the world.\nHigh credibility of text: King Charles III and Queen Camilla during their coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey, London, May 6, 2023.

To the crowds gathered under rainy skies — thousands of whom had camped overnight — it was a chance to be part of a historic event. Julie Newman, a 77-year-old visitor from Canada, said the royal procession had been “absolutely fabulous. Couldn’t ask for anything better.” “But we’re ready to go back home and watch it all on the television,” she added. But to millions more, the day was greeted with a shrug, the awe and reverence the ceremony was designed to evoke largely gone. And to a few, it was reason to protest. Hundreds who want to see Britain become a republic gathered to holler “Not my king.” They see the monarchy as an institution that stands for privilege and inequality, in a country of deepening poverty and fraying social ties.

The train is perpetually off the track. Sometimes it's his fault, sometimes it's not, but he has to deal with that stuff.\"   Indeed, Adkins has had his share of tabloid headlines over the years — but forgive him for forgetting one more glaringly obvious reason that the part fits him to a T: The singer and his character are both big-time country stars. And obviously, Adkins' casting is just one of the ways the show, which is set in Austin, is sure to bring a country music authenticity to what promises to be one of the fall's hottest — and steamiest — new shows.\nLow credibility of text: Adkins has even more acting experience; he said he's drawn to film and TV for the same reason he enjoys recording music. \"When I'm in the studio, it's just such a creative environment that stimulates me, and I just absolutely love it,\" he said. \"Television sets and movie sets are the same way. Everybody is so talented in that environment. I love the creativity, and I like being a part of it.\"   But even with his experience, he admitted, he was initially \"terrified\" to share scenes with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon.   \"And then,\" he said, \"I quickly realized, oh my God, she's so professional and so good that she's gonna carry the scene. So, if you don't throw up on yourself, you'll probably be OK because she's gonna do all the heavy lifting.

Monarch will make its debut on September 11 so be sure to mark your calendars and maybe even prepare a menu of cowboy food for the big event! In the meantime, as we all await the premiere, let's take some time to get to know the talented actors that make up Monarch's cast. This show is loaded with seasoned Hollywood and country music stars, as well as newcomers offering fresh charisma for the camera. Those who have seen the trailer already know that Oscar-award-winning legend Susan Sarandon and country music singer Trace Adkins will star alongside each other in the upcoming series. But we're providing a little more information on their characters, as well as details about the rest of the cast.

Sarandon will take the lead role as country music queen Dottie Roman.\nHigh credibility of text: By Rosy Cordero  Associate Editor, TV Three-time Academy of Country Music Award winner Trace Adkins has joined the cast of Fox’s midseason drama Monarch in a leading role. He joins previously announced cast members Susan Sarandon and Anna Friel. Adkins will portray Albie Roman — Texas Truthteller, reigning King of Country Music and husband of Dottie Cantrell Roman (Sarandon), known as the tough-as-nails Queen of Country Music, with whom he has helped create a country music dynasty. The Romans, whose name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. And when their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown Nicolette “Nicky” Roman (Friel) will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom.            Fox Day @ TCA: Deadline’s Full Coverage Created by Melissa London Hilfers, Monarch is described as a Texas-sized, multigenerational musical drama about America’s first family of country music. The series debuts with a special two-night event beginning Sunday, Jan. 30, immediately following the NFC Championship Game and continuing on Tuesday, Feb. 1. Adkins is repped by Greg Baker & Associates; Nick Meinema is with Action Entertainment, and Michael Reinert is repped by Fox Rothschild LLP.\nLow credibility of text: Adkins also said he didn't \"really lean on anybody\" for advice when it came to prepping for the role, even though his friends Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw have years of TV experience. Blake has been on \"The Voice\" for years, and Tim recently starred in the \"Yellowstone\" prequel, \"1883.\" \"Blake’s thing is a completely different animal,\" he said. \"You can’t compare that stuff.\" He said he hadn't talked to McGraw, but added: \"Tim’s a good actor, I’ve always respected what he does. I’ve just kind of done my own thing, haven’t had to really lean on anybody too much for a lot of advice.\" Adkins, who isn't a stranger to acting, with previous stints on television and in the recent movies \"Old Henry,\" \"Apache Junction\" and \"Badland,\" said playing Albie, his character on \"Monarch,\" wasn't too big of a stretch. \"He's a no-nonsense kind of guy, and I’m kind of that way too,\" Adkins admitted. \"He’s not very animated, and neither am I. We say what we’ve gotta say, and don’t have to yell it … just kind of move through this life as softly and peacefully as they’ll allow us to, but when they don’t – we'll do what we’ve gotta do.\n\nQuestion:What is Trace Adkins' role in \"Monarch\"?\nAnswer:"

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.\nHigh credibility of text: Susie hopes to become an internet sensation, and make enough money to give her and her mother, now bed-ridden with MS, a more comfortable life. But “Susie Searches” isn’t taking off as hoped, unlike the meditation site hosted by campus hunk Jesse (Alex Wolff). When Jesse suddenly goes missing, Susie seizes the opportunity to solve the mystery and make “Susie Searches” a hit. Cute and colorful, SUSIE SEARCHES is a “girl detective” mystery story in the Nancy Drew mode – until it isn’t. Actor-turned-director Sophie Kargman turns this sunny tale in a wholly unexpected direction. As Susie, Kiersey Clemons is impressive, as the title character finds her way through the plot’s twists. In her feature film directorial debut, Kargman takes the script she co-wrote with William Day Frank and the idea of their short film, and transforms it into a tale you don’t see coming, until it is right upon you.\nLow credibility of text: As a satirical look at our era’s growing fascination with celebrity in the digital age, there’s something to the fact that we are often the orchestrators of our own demise since shortcuts don’t need strong foundations. So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

Clemons is terrific in embodying Susie’s many contradictions, her sunny awkward demeanor covering dark ambition. Sherin Nicole  Everyone—no matter how nefarious or nice—is the hero of their story.

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something” outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one” team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.\nHigh credibility of text: 36  Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2022. View the full list.  Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he’d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team’s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars’ eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.\nLow credibility of text: Busch entered the 2022 Cup season without a contract extension with JGR in large part due to the decision by longtime sponsor Mars Inc. – announced in December 2021 – that it would end its NASCAR sponsorship at the conclusion of the 2022 season. He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.\nLow credibility of text: Busch joins a two-car RCR team that has Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick under contract for next season. RCR will presumably expand to three cars to accommodate Busch’s arrival, though the team could negotiate a buyout of Reddick’s contract that has one year remaining after Reddick announced earlier this year that he’s leaving to join 23XI Racing in 2024.

And on top of driving for RCR, his deal is also leading him to swap manufacturers for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. His team will be branded by Chevrolet in 2023, a major overhaul with Chase Purdy and Jack Wood joining the team. Fortunately for Busch, he will not have to worry about finding sponsors at RCR. 3CHI, Alsco, BetMGM, Cheddars and Lenovo have all confirmed they will sponsor the No. 8 car. And if anyone can bring back a championship trophy to RCR, it will be Busch.\n\nQuestion:Which team will Kyle Busch join in 2023?\nAnswer:"

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Titans showrunner Greg Walker previously told EW that when he reached out to actor Titus Welliver about portraying iconic DC supervillain Lex Luthor in season 4, he was surprised to find that Welliver was already well-versed in the comic book history of the Teen Titans.  \"I've been collecting comic books since I was 7 or 8 years old,\" Welliver tells EW. \"I'm 60 now, so that's a lot of comic books.\"  He has the nerd knowledge to prove it, too. Check out EW's conversation with Welliver about Luthor and all things Titans below.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What first got you interested in the Teen Titans?  TITUS WELLIVER: I love the period in the late '60s and the '70s when they're less clean-cut, their hair is longer, they're kind of hip, they're go-go dancing.

We know that from reading the comics. We’ve thought that Lex Luthor has been killed and, ‘Oh, no — that was a clone.'\" The star added that the storyline \"was to really propel Connor/Superboy’s story into the forefront of things, and give the fans of the show something to really bite into, to have a sense of where that character is going.\" Titans sirs on HBO Max in the US.

Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman’s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor’s arrival since season two when Conner/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character’s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility. Fans can get really picky nowadays, and Lex Luthor has been a major source of controversy for the past few years. Almost no one liked Jesse Eisenberg’s young, temperamental version of Luthor, but Welliver at least is older and bears a resemblance to the character. However, he will be sporting a beard akin to Jon Cryer’s iteration in the Arrowverse. You can check out the first look at Welliver as Lex Luthor below (courtesy of Entertainment Weekly).

Welliver also happens to be a huge comic book fan and didn’t take much convincing to join Titans, showrunner Greg Walker said. \"You usually have to do this whole dog-and-pony show to get an actor to do the show. But when I called to kind of lure him in, I could barely get a word in. We were talking on the phone and he was just walking through his library, telling me about all his Wolfman/Perez Titans editions. He's a giant, giant fan. He'd watched every episode of the show, and could tell me about certain stories, certain shots. It was the most unexpected call I've ever had.\" As for the character itself, Walker promised a comic-accurate portrayal. Luthor is one of the most menacing and cunning villains ever, having bested Superman several times using nothing but his wits. Titans will stay true to Luthor’s comic persona. \"He has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power. You know what he's done, what he's capable of doing, except like many of those people, he's personable. He doesn't have a cat on his lap. Yeah. He's curious, which I think is very interesting about his character.\n\nQuestion:Who was playing Lex Luthor in Titans?\nAnswer:"

The South Korean star of Netflix’s most popular show ever collected the award in person on Sunday night. Lee’s lead performance in the international hit action drama was nominated against Bob Odenkirk for “Better Call Saul,” Adam Scott for “Severance,” Jason Bateman for “Ozark,” and Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong from “Succession” (the latter of which was the 2020 winner for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series). On “Squid Game,” the charismatic actor played the blundering Seong Gi-hun who, after he was unable to pay off all his debts, was kidnapped and manipulated into competing in a competition with real life or death stakes. Last competitor left standing wins a seismic cash prize.

The win makes him the first Asian actor to receive the award. The win also makes him only the fourth Asian actor ever to win an Emmy for acting and the first ever to win the award for a non-English speaking role. Lee competed against Jason Bateman (Ozark), Brian Cox (Succession), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Adam Scott (Severance) and Jeremy Strong (Succession). \"Thank you to the Television Academy, thank you to Netflix and thank you to the director for making realistic problems we all face come to life so creatively on the screen with a great script.

Ahmed’s historic win “punctuates the lack of Asian actor winners,” she said. Meanwhile, there were no Asian female acting nominees at this year’s Emmys. “Women were missing again,” Wang Yuen said. “Where were Constance Wu, Lucy Liu and Mindy Kaling?” “Talent is not the problem,” she also said, “but, to paraphrase Viola Davis’s speech from a few years ago, the only thing that separates Asian/American actors from anyone else is opportunity; you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Wang Yuen pioneered a study this year called “Tokens on the Small Screen: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Prime Time and Streaming Television.” Professors and scholars at six California universities surveyed 242 broadcast, cable and digital platform shows that aired during the 2015-2016 season.\nLow credibility of text: He won for his performance on the HBO limited series The Night Of.

Not long ago, most roles for South Asians were bit parts, and included “terrorists cab drivers and the odd medical professional,” as The Post’s Lavanya Ramanathan wrote last month. “A major metropolitan newspaper once counted Apu from ‘The Simpsons’ as a South Asian role — that’s how bad it was,” Ramanathan wrote. Mindy Kaling’s “The Mindy Project” was the first show written by and starring an Indian American woman. An Indian American comedian, Hasan Minhaj, hosted the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner.

These efforts will help organizations to effectively, efficiently and continuously manage and configure their complex mix of security products.”  “The Mandiant brand is synonymous with unmatched insights for organizations seeking to keep themselves secure in a constantly changing environment,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. “This is an opportunity to deliver an end-to-end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world. Together we can make a profound impact in securing the cloud, accelerating the adoption of cloud computing, and ultimately make the world safer.” The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of Mandiant stockholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close later this year. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati P.C. is acting as legal advisor to Mandiant.

He added: \"We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help customers address their most important security challenges.\" The deal is expected to close later this year. Shares of Mandiant closed up 16% on Monday after The Information reported that Google was interested in acquiring the company. Mandiant, which has a market value around $5.25 billion, was previously under the FireEye umbrella before that brand was sold. FireEye was credited with helping Microsoft discover the SolarWinds hack that attacked government systems in 2019 and 2020. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday, \"With cyber attacks increasing by the day and cyber warfare underway from Russia/state sponsored cyber terrorism organizations, Google is doubling down on its cyber security footprint at the right time with Mandiant and looking to differentiate itself from the likes of behemoths Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud arms race.\nHigh credibility of text: Google has announced that its proposed $5.4 billion bid to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant is now complete. The internet giant revealed plans to acquire publicly traded Mandiant back in March, less than a year after Mandiant was spun out of its previous owner FireEye as part of a $1.2 billion deal with private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. Moving forward, Mandiant will operate under the auspices of Google Cloud, though the Mandiant brand will live on. “We will retain the Mandiant brand and continue Mandiant’s mission to make every organization secure from cyber threats and confident in their readiness,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post.

The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.

Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.

I thought Walter Cronkite and the news were so boring. But my dad insisted it was important to know what was going on in the world. My dad had no idea how he was preparing me. Night after night, Walter Cronkite came into the living room reporting the news, and people trusted that he was giving them the truth. My dad was one of those people.

Link returns next year in the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild. Nintendo capped off its September Direct presentation with a new trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild, now officially titled The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game is set to launch for Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023. Although brief, the trailer offers a look at some new gameplay footage, showcasing more landscapes and several new powers that Link will be able to wield in the upcoming game. You can watch the full video below. The Breath of the Wild sequel was first revealed during E3 2019, and was initially planned to launch in 2022. Earlier this year, however, Nintendo announced it was delaying the game to spring 2023 to give the team some additional development time. \"We previously announced that we were aiming for a 2022 release for this game. However, we have decided to extend our development time a bit and change the release to spring 2023,\" Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said in a video message. \"For those of you who have been looking forward to a release this year, we apologize.\nLow credibility of text: The original release date for the game was due to be this year (2022).

However, the expanded world goes beyond that, and there will be an even wider variety of features you can enjoy, including new encounters and new gameplay elements.\" So we're going to have to wait a little longer to find out the official name, as well as get our hands on the game itself.    Discover GGRecon Welcome to a place where words matter.

According to Aonuma, the sequel will build atop the original's world with a new story and gameplay elements,[220] and is inspired in part by Red Dead Redemption 2.[221] Fujibayashi will reprise his role as director.[222] Originally set to be released in 2022, the game was delayed to early 2023.[223][224] The game was released on May 12, 2023.[219]\nLow credibility of text: Nintendo has guarded the new Breath of the Wild game so tightly that players do not even know the title of the new Legend of Zelda. Fans have called the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, BOTW 2, and the Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, according to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details” about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the Wild 2 title has been spreading around online https://t.co/hy4V0WiTX2 pic.twitter.\nLow credibility of text: Written by  Mel Ramsay Posted  30th Mar 2022 11:03 The original Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is universally accepted as one of the best games of all time, with enviable review scores from critics and players alike. So with the sequel on its way (albeit later than we anticipated due to a recently revealed delay), many people are referring to it as Breath of the Wild 2.  However, an insider has now claimed that it won't be called that at all, and instead will be named Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality. Nintendo Life journalist, Paul Gale, shared a blogpost on his own website, claiming that a source close to Nintendo informed him of the name. Apparently, the company wants to capitalise on the fact that the name 'Breath of the Wild' is synonymous with 'amazing game', but they also want to hit home that you can play as more than just Link.  In the post, Gale continued that there was another benefit to the word 'duality', saying: \"...duality between character abilities, on land and floating regions, past and present, darkness and light, etc.\" Sadly, as is the case with these things sometimes, the insider apparently \"did note that this name was seen a considerable amount of time ago and could have been one of many template titles.\" So by now, the name could've changed. Damn.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild?\nAnswer:"

Tears of the Kingdom was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content (DLC) had exceeded its scope. Its development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development (EPD) division, specifically Production Group Number 3,[1] with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. A teaser was shown at E3 2019 with a full reveal at E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned for release in 2022 before being delayed to May 2023. It received acclaim for its improvements, expanded open world, and features encouraging exploration and experimentation. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of release, and had sold over 18.5 million copies by June 2023.[2]  Tears of the Kingdom retains the open-world action-adventure gameplay of the previous Zelda game, Breath of the Wild (2017).\nHigh credibility of text: Want to contribute to this wiki?Sign up for an account, and get started!Come join the Zelda Wiki community Discord server!

Quick notes on my process:         I am assuming acts that play in Central Texas before May to be in play. There is precedence (albeit a limited one) for acts to play in May and still make it on the bill but 99% of the time, if they play May or later, they are out for ACL.         I will not include any acts that played ACL in the past two years. While I know there are some very limited cases of artists playing twice in a three-year span, it would be overkill to track over 300+ acts when 99% of them are out. Only in very obvious cases will I track a '21 or '22 act.\n\nQuestion:When is ACL 2023 taking place?\nAnswer:"

ARR papers committed to EMNLP will be handled by the Senior Area Chairs. For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required “limitations” section, if it was missing from the ARR submission; see below). This year, some of the reviews, author responses and meta reviews will be made publicly available. Our motivation is to provide increased transparency in the review process, to foster more accountability for reviewers and higher quality reviews as well as enabling peer review research by providing an open collection of papers and reviews. We will follow a process where only reviews, author responses and meta reviews of accepted papers and opt-in rejected papers (where opting in is done by authors) will be made publicly available after the acceptance notifications. We will use the OpenReview platform, which is also currently used by the ACL Rolling Review as well as other related conferences and is well suited to this type of process. Papers that are in the ARR system after May 27, 2023, either submitted after or submitted before and not withdrawn, cannot be submitted to EMNLP 2023.

Presidents, prime ministers, princes, an emperor and an empress were among the dignitaries paying their final respects — a testament to the Queen's far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy. Thousands of people flocked to the Abbey and streets along the 25-mile (40-kilometer) procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Queen's flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place in St. George's Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle. © 2023 Cable News Network.

The Funeral was broadcast live on TV, radio and The Royal Family's Youtube Channel to allow people around the world to take part in mourning The Queen. The Queen's Coffin had been Lying-in-State since the evening of Wednesday 14th September. At 6.30am on the morning of Monday 19th September, the Lying-in-State ended.      At 1044hrs the Coffin was borne in Procession on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey for the State Funeral. Immediately following the Coffin was The King, Members of the Royal Family and members of The King’s Household.           The State Funeral Service was conducted by the Dean of Westminster and The Sermon and the Commendation were given by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nLow credibility of text: The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.\nLow credibility of text: Britain bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a majestic funeral steeped in tradition and a send-off reflective of the broad popularity she managed to retain over her remarkable seven-decade reign.

Presidents, prime ministers, princes and princesses, and other public figures sat side-by-side to pay their last respects – a testament to her far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy.            The funeral, which served as both a state and religious service and marked the culmination of 10 days of mourning, honored the Queen with the sort of pageantry that she used to promote the royal family and “brand Britain” throughout her life.           Tens of thousands of people flocked to streets around Westminster Abbey and along the 25-mile procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the sovereign’s flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place.           In the third and last procession of the day, the Queen’s coffin was taken past throngs of well-wishers lining the Long Walk to Windsor Castle for her committal service and burial at St. George’s Chapel, where she was separated from the crown for the final time.

Watch it in the embedded player below.  Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-serving British monarch in history, died at the age of 96. The PBS NewsHour takes a look back at the queen’s life and her historic role. Here’s what we know about the days and weeks to come. Buckingham Palace has long planned out a series of procedures to carry out in the days and months after the event of Elizabeth’s death. As The Guardian reported in 2017, the queen’s funeral is expected to take place 10 days after her death, allowing for a period of national mourning. The state funeral for Elizabeth will take place on Monday, Sept. 19 at Westminster Abbey in London, the Associated Press reports. WATCH LIVE: Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral Elizabeth’s eldest son, Charles, formerly the Prince of Wales, has immediately become the King of England and is now King Charles III. His wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, is now the Queen Consort, as Elizabeth requested at her royal jubilee in February. Next in line after King Charles III is Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. He is the elder son of Charles and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, who famously died in 1997 in a car crash.\nHigh credibility of text: On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nLow credibility of text: The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.\nLow credibility of text: London (CNN)–The death of Queen Elizabeth II has set into motion an intricate period of mourning which will culminate with a huge state funeral on September 19 honoring her lifetime of devotion and steadfast service.            Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.\n\nQuestion:Where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place?\nAnswer:"

Three people are confirmed dead after two small aircraft collided mid-air in Colorado Saturday, authorities said. Multiple 911 callers reported seeing two planes collide over Boulder County shortly before 9 a.m. local time, the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said. The aircraft collided and crashed near Vance Brand Airport in Longmont at 8:50 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The collision involved a single-engine Cessna 172 and a Sonex Xenos aircraft, a type of motor glider, the National Transportation Safety Board said. First responders found two separate crash sites near Niwot Road, the sheriff's office said. Aerial footage showed that one of the aircraft had landed in trees, while the other crashed into a nearby field. Two people were on board the Cessna 172, the FAA said. The sheriff's office also said it confirmed two people were on board the plane, both of whom were found dead at the scene. The sheriff's office said at this time one person was confirmed to be in the aircraft, who was also found dead at the scene.

It's picked up by air traffic control radar so that your plane can be identified by the number, altitude and ground speed. But the technology also lets airplanes communicate among each other. So now the same ping goes off between point or one airplane to the other,\" Feith explained.  Besides that system, Feith believes this is more of a \"see and avoid\" type accident.  \"That is on a beautiful day like this, it is incumbent upon each pilot flying in the airspace to clear the area visually to ensure that things like this don't happen,\" he said.  Feith adds that the airspace around where this crash may have happened, is known to have high air traffic, especially since it's known as a \"training box.\" \"So you have a lot of airplanes operating in a band of airspace or a box of airspace.\nHigh credibility of text: At least three people died after two planes collided midair Saturday in Boulder County, Colorado, officials say.

It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]\nHigh credibility of text: The ceremony took place after a week of tensions within Meloni’s coalition after partner Berlusconi boasted about his ties with Russian President Putin. Hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy’s first female prime minister amid looming questions over her coalition partners’ stance towards Russia. The 45-year-old leader recited the ritual oath of office before Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday after her party Brothers of Italy won more than 25 percent of the vote in snap elections in late September. She pledged to act “in the exclusive interests of the nation” – a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women. The ceremony took place a day after Meloni along with her coalition partners – hardliner Matteo Salvini of the League party and Forza Italia’s TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi – unveiled their cabinet. The government is expected to face confidence votes in parliament next week. Forza Italia’s Antonio Tajani is now the country’s foreign minister. He has a long history with European institutions and was president of the European Parliament in 2017. The economy ministry will be in the hands of League’s Giancarlo Giorgetti who is considered relatively pro-Europe, and one of the most moderate among party members.

She received the mandate to form a government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.\nLow credibility of text: He succeeded in being elected by obtaining 116 votes out of 206 in the first round thanks to the support from opposition parties to the centre-right coalition.[117][118][119] Tensions further grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as \"patronising, overbearing, arrogant ... [and] offensive\" in a series of written notes in the Senate.[120][121] In the following days, after meetings between parties' leader, tensions loosened and the centre-right coalition parties reached an agreement on the formation of the new cabinet.[122]  On 20 October, consultations between President Sergio Mattarella and parties officially began. On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy–Us Moderates–MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]\nLow credibility of text: The possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.\n\nQuestion:Who is Italy's first female prime minister?\nAnswer:"

Ramsey, meanwhile, is unavailable after becoming the father of twins on Sunday. Wales will also be without the injured teenager Ethan Ampadu, who controlled midfield when Wales thrashed Ireland 4-1 in Cardiff last month. Victory in Dublin would take Wales above Denmark to the top of their Nations League group while defeat would put them bottom. Wales have won only three competitive matches without Bale since he made his international debut in 2006. “We have to cope, prove people wrong, make that record better,” said Giggs. “It’s not going to be easy but we’ve still got players who can make things happen.” Ben Davies, the left-back, struck a similar note. “These are the games where we have to adapt and show what we’re about. We’ve got a lot of young quality coming through and we’ve got to show what we can do.” The absences could lead to a start for Harry Wilson, a 21-year-old on loan at Derby County from Liverpool.\nLow credibility of text: But he has quickly established himself as one of Swansea's key players having returned to the club after leaving Stoke City at the end of last season.

Wales sit bottom of League A Group 4 with one draw from four games, with results not helped by Page having to field largely second-string sides in two of those games as he prepared for what would turn out to be a historic World Cup play-off victory over Ukraine.

In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?

Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired.

First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nLow credibility of text: Simply reading “Pixel Watch 2” in an official-looking font, it’s unclear if it was taken from an internal Google source, or is simply a mock-up. The tweet was posted on the 9th of May, potentially hinting at an I/O reveal (the keynote took place the next day) but one never came. Let’s face it, the Pixel Watch 2 isn’t going to land until the latter half of 2023 at the earliest. The first-gen Pixel Watch is barely six months old, and Google has yet to even confirm whether it’ll see annual updates like its Pixel smartphones. With Apple and Samsung both ploughing on with new models every twelve months, though, it’s a safe bet that Google will follow suit. That means we can expect the Pixel Watch 2 to arrive in October 2023 alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, barring any delays.  Pricing is more of an unknown. You could pick up a Pixel Watch for £339/$350 at launch, but prices quickly dropped and now you can get one for £300/$300 with a bit of shopping around. Would a successor land at a more modest price to drum up interest? And while Google managed to match the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro‘s prices to their predecessors, the Pixel 7a arrived with a £50/$50 increase over the outgoing Pixel 6a.\nLow credibility of text: You can read our full Pixel Watch review for all of our in-depth analysis, but the overall takeaway is that we were left with an expectation that Google is just getting started. We fully expect to see a Pixel Watch 2 in the not-to-distant future. For starters, the lineup stands out among Wear OS-based wearables with a streamlined, Google-centric user experience and unique Fitbit integration. As such, it’s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit’s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features. Respected leaker Evan Blass tweeted an image containing the words “Pixel Watch 2” on May 9. It’s unclear if this image was derived from an official source. Nevertheless, this is as close as we’ve gotten to a Pixel Watch 2 confirmation given Blass’s reliability. Check out the image below. A report from 9to5Google in late May that details some of the Pixel Watch 2’s specs also appears to confirm that Google is working on a sequel to its smartwatch. In another report from the outlet, an APK teardown appears to have revealed a new codename, “eos.” Prior to this information, a leak revealed the codename “aurora.\nLow credibility of text: 17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\nHigh credibility of text: 27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41 mm (1.6 in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294 mAh battery and 2 GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\n\nQuestion:What is the release date of the Pixel Watch?\nAnswer:"

The 67-year-old Abe, who was Japan’s longest-serving leader when he resigned in 2020, collapsed bleeding and was airlifted to a nearby hospital in Nara, although he was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead after receiving massive blood transfusions, officials said. A hearse carrying Abe’s body left the hospital early Saturday to head back to his home in Tokyo. Abe’s wife Akie lowered her head as the vehicle passed before a crowd of journalists. Nara Medical University emergency department chief Hidetada Fukushima said Abe suffered major damage to his heart, along with two neck wounds that damaged an artery. He never regained his vital signs, Fukushima said. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. Police said he used a gun that was obviously homemade — about 15 inches (40 centimeters) long — and they confiscated similar weapons and his personal computer when they raided his nearby one-room apartment.\nHigh credibility of text: On 8 July 2022 around 11:30 JST,[299][300] Abe was shot while delivering a campaign speech at Yamato-Saidaiji Station, Nara.[301][302][2] He was supporting fellow LDP party member Kei Satō for the House of Councillors election.[303]  The assassin approached Abe from behind and fired two shots using a homemade firearm. The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the chest. He was fatally struck in the heart.[304][305][306][307]  Abe was rushed to the Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara by helicopter. Prior to his arrival at the hospital, Abe had already shown no vital signs. Despite a transfusion of 100 units of blood (≈ 30 litres),[308] the blood loss was too great and attempts to resuscitate Abe failed;[309][310] he was pronounced dead at 17:03 JST.[303][311]  He was 67 years old.[2]  A 41-year-old man named Tetsuya Yamagami, a former JMSDF member, was immediately arrested and later confessed to local police.[312][313] Yamagami stated that he held a grudge against the Unification Church[314][315][316] and shot Abe because \"the religious group and Abe were connected\".\nHigh credibility of text: Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan and a serving member of the House of Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6]  Leaders from many nations expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in 1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9]  The suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead.

Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.\n\nQuestion:when did Shinzo Abe die?\nAnswer:"

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech on July 8 outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. Yamagami then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation prosecutors said showed he's fit to stand trial.   Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them he killed Abe, one of Japan's most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe's apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.  One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.\nHigh credibility of text: Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister of Japan and a serving member of the House of Representatives, was assassinated on 8 July 2022 while speaking at a political event outside Yamato-Saidaiji Station in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan.[3][4][5] While delivering a campaign speech for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate, he was shot from behind at close range by a man with an improvised firearm.[1] Abe was transported by a medical helicopter to Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, where he was pronounced dead.[6]  Leaders from many nations expressed shock and dismay at Abe's assassination,[7] which was the first of a former Japanese prime minister since Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo during the February 26 incident in 1936.[8] Prime Minister Kishida decided to hold a state funeral for Abe on 27 September.[9]  The suspect, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami (Japanese: 山上 徹也), was arrested at the scene for attempted murder; the charge was later upgraded to murder after Abe was pronounced dead. Yamagami told investigators that he had shot Abe in relation to a grudge he held against the Unification Church (UC), to which Abe and his family had political ties, over his mother's bankruptcy in 2002.\nLow credibility of text: 82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.\nLow credibility of text: 66][70][71] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area.[72][73][74] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed. Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist.[75][76] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout. This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot.[77]  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am.[78] Six out of the twenty-four emergency responders at the scene later showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Nara City Fire Department.[78]  Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot.[79] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious.[80] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding under his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot.[81] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival.\n\nQuestion:who killed Shinzo Abe?\nAnswer:"

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.\nLow credibility of text: (Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP)                                                           TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan’s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.\nHigh credibility of text: The state funeral of Shinzo Abe, former prime minister of Japan and serving member of the House of Representatives who was assassinated on 8 July 2022, was attended by roughly 3,600 people within Japan alone and by around 700 international attendees.[1] The funeral was held on 27 September 2022 at the Nippon Budokan venue in Chiyoda, Tokyo.

TOKYO — Japan held a rare state funeral for its longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Tuesday, despite widespread public opposition to the event. Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun. The government estimates that 23,000 mourners lined up to lay flowers at tables in front of pictures of Abe outside the hall. In a sign of the divisions surrounding the commemoration, thousands of others took to the streets in protest. Just down the street from the Budokan, protesters opposed to the state funeral tussled with Abe supporters and police.

Follow Us Copyright © Fandango. All rights reserved.\nLow credibility of text: House of the Dragon. Photograph by Ollie Upton / HBO We’ve rounded the halfway point on House of the Dragon season 1, HBO’s much-hyped Game of Thrones prequel series. House of the Dragon will feature a large time jump between Episodes 5 and 6; when the dust settles, a bunch of major characters will be played by different actors, and the realm will be a very different place. The floodgates are beginning to open and we are finding out more and more about the last five episodes of season 1. HBO now has Episodes 6-10 listed on their official schedule, complete with runtimes. In addition, Rotten Tomatoes‘ series page for the show has episode titles listed. We’re going to lay it all out below, with the slight caveat that since the Rotten Tomatoes episode titles have not been officially confirmed by HBO, they must be taken with a grain of salt. The only episode title HBO has confirmed is for Episode 6. While the episode titles aren’t confirmed by HBO, it’s still enough to get us pretty excited. “The Lord of the Tides” refers to the head of House Velaryon; why will that be so relevant during the longest episode of the season? Then there’s “The Green Council.\nHigh credibility of text: Den of Geek    Ad New actors, new dragons, and new drama keep House of the Dragon fresh after a 10-year time jump. This House of the Dragon review contains spoilers. “The Princess and the Queen” is effectively a second pilot episode for House of the Dragon. The installment flashes further forward into the future than ever before and ages its characters up so severely that they may as well be entirely different people. And that’s not even to mention the nearly dozen actually new characters that the episode does introduce in the form of Queen Alicent, Princess Rhaenyra, and Prince Daemon’s respective broods of children.  The decision to jump so far down the timeline midseason is as bold a one as you’re likely to see on television. It has every reason to be a disastrous one as well. Shuffling the board to this extent halfway through a story shouldn’t work. And yet, work “The Princess and The Queen” does. This episode isn’t just an impressive technical maneuver. It’s by far the most entertaining and enriching dispatch from House of the Dragon yet.  The fresh burst of energy that “The Princess and The Queen” provides to House of the Dragon is evident from its very first scene.\nLow credibility of text: Also, don't get in their way, because this is one couple that'll stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) began as Rhaenyra's protector, then killed her husband's lover at her wedding, and now he may be on the side of Queen Alicent, who talked him out of killing himself in the Godswood at the end of episode 5. He's seen fighting Ser Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr), aka Harwin Breakbones, noted for his strength. If Ser Harwin is now Rhaenyra's protector, this could be essentially an Alicent-Rhaenyra proxy fight right here. Stay tuned. Episode 6 of House of the Dragon will air on Sept. 25 on HBO Max.\nLow credibility of text: The teaser also features the queen and the princess’ latest spat, with tempers flaring so much that Alicent publicly pulls a knife on Rhaenyra. Now that the pivotal sixth episode has made its way to air, we’re officially in the back stretch of the season. House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon’s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, “Driftmark,” which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who’ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter’s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark. As we’ve seen in the trailer, viewers will see the funeral for Laena.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of House of the Dragon's sixth episode?\nAnswer:"

She later called Derry Girls \"a love letter to the place I come from and the people who shaped me.\" Derry Girls stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Louisa Harland and Dylan Llewellyn as a group of Irish teens growing up in Northern Ireland in the ‘90s. Coughlan is now one of the stars of Bridgerton, and is set to step into the leading lady spot for season three.\n\nQuestion:When is the premiere date of Derry Girls Season 3?\nAnswer:"

The Nobel Prize is not a single prize, but five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, are awarded \"to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\". Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace.  The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, 10 December. As of 2022, 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 226 laureates, 214 men and 12 women. The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist, Emil von Behring, for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose, important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes. The most recent Nobel prize was announced by the Karolinska Institute on 3 October 2022, and has been awarded to Swedish Svante Pääbo, for the discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution.\nHigh credibility of text: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 113 times to 225 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2022.

The last classical physiology laureates were John Eccles, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley in 1963 for their findings regarding \"unitary electrical events in the central and peripheral nervous system.\"[20]  A Medicine or Physiology Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[21] These are awarded during the prize ceremony at the Stockholm Concert Hall.

The awarding of the prize in 1973 to Nikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch for their observations of animal behavioural patterns could be considered a prize in the behavioural sciences rather than medicine or physiology.[14] Tinbergen expressed surprise in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at \"the unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award this year's prize 'for Physiology or Medicine' to three men who had until recently been regarded as 'mere animal watchers'\".[44]  Laureates have been awarded the Nobel Prize in a wide range of fields that relate to physiology or medicine. As of 2010[update], eight Prizes have been awarded for contributions in the field of signal transduction through G proteins and second messengers. 13 have been awarded for contributions in the field of neurobiology[45] and 13 have been awarded for contributions in Intermediary metabolism.[46] The 100 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 195 individuals through 2009.[47][48]  Twelve women have received the prize: Gerty Cori (1947), Rosalyn Yalow (1977), Barbara McClintock (1983), Rita Levi-Montalcini (1986), Gertrude B.\n\nQuestion:Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine?\nAnswer:"

The appointment of Collier as Fox’s entertainment chief executive officer surprised the industry — even some internal Fox staffers, who had expected to see Gary Newman oversee the network’s transition into a standalone entity once 21st Century Fox’s merger with The Walt Disney Company was complete. Newman has been atop the Fox network as Fox TV Group chairman with Dana Walden since 2014, and has run 20th Century Fox TV with Walden since 1999.

Even before Friday’s announcement, Newman’s nearly 20-year partnership with Walden was set to finish by the end of December, as Walden has been named chairman of Disney TV Studios and ABC Entertainment.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still available.\nLow credibility of text: With Red Bull finally reestablishing itself as the dominant force in Formula One, Perez has had the benefit of racing in superior equipment all season and he's managed to turn that into the first two victories of his F1 career.

After all these years, Black Adam is now finally ready to begin filming, and star Sarah Shahi, whose role has remained relatively mysterious, may have now revealed who she is playing. Shahi recently took to social media to celebrate the start of filming on the DC outing, referring to her character as \"Adrianna,\" and thus likely confirming and ongoing rumor that she will, in fact, be playing Adrianna Tomaz. \"Today is my first day filming #blackadam. I was cast in this role a year ago. I've had ups, downs, lefts, and rights. They all led me here. Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna. Let's continue to lift each other up as we tell each other's stories. Human stories. Connecting stories. Stories we all have inside of us.\" Adrianna Tomaz was originally spun out of the 1970s TV series The Secrets of Isis, which aired alongside the original Shazam! television show. The character was later folded into DC lore, becoming known as the wife of Black Adam. A refugee who is delivered to Black Adam as a gift, the supervillain quickly develops a deep respect for Adrianna, eventually gifting her with the magical amulet of Isis, which imbues her with powers over the forces of nature.\nLow credibility of text: She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she’s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.\nLow credibility of text: Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.\n\nQuestion:who played Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam?\nAnswer:"

Deadline is reporting that Raymond Lee has been cast in the leading role in the new Quantum Leap pilot. Lee will portray Dr. Ben Seong, the “spiritual successor” of Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), the original time traveler on the series. Within the reboot/revival series, Seong is described as both “a world-renowned physicist” and also “a man of faith.” The potential show takes place 30 years after Sam disappeared into the time travel machine he created: the Quantum Leap accelerator. Seong will initially be a member of the new team, before eventually using the accelerator to go back to the past. According to to the report, ” Ben Seong gets stuck in the late 1980s with amnesia.” But there’s no mention about whether someone on his team can communicate with him in the form of a hologram, like the late Dean Stockwell’s Al. Lee’s previous credits include Scandal, Made of Love, Prodigal Son, Mozart in the Jungle, and Here and Now. He is also a series regular on AMC’s Kevin Can F*** Himself. Bakula has had negotiations to take part in the new series, but he is currently not attached to it.

The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother, will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.\nLow credibility of text: Aiding him throughout his leaps is Addison (Caitlin Bassett), who appears in the form of a hologram only Ben can see and hear. A decorated Army veteran who brings level-headed precision to her job, Ben will need her as he leaps from person to person.

The rest of the team at headquarters includes Ian Wright (Mason Alexander Park), who runs the Artificial Intelligence unit “Ziggy,” and Jenn Chou (Nanrisa Lee), who heads up digital security for the project. As Ben leaps from life to life, putting right what once went wrong, it becomes clear that he and the team are on a thrilling journey. However, Addison, Magic, Ian and Jenn know that if they are going to solve the mystery of Ben’s leap and bring him home, they must act fast or lose him forever.  Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett and Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci, the original Quantum Leap ran for five seasons between 1989 and 1993.\nLow credibility of text: The cast also includes Nanrisa Lee (Bosch) as Jenn, head of QL security, and Mason Alexander Park (Cowboy Bebop) as Ian, the mastermind of the artificial intelligence program running the titular operation.

We’ve got your covered, by searching through the best loot spots for you to get this beast of a GPU. The RTX 4090, Nvidia’s shining star, is certainly one of the best graphics cards on the market right now. With jaw-dropping performance metrics, it’s no wonder it carries a steep price tag of $1599. Since its introduction on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU. If the hype around the RTX 4090 is anything to go by, we might see the RTX 4090 Ti drop sooner as a surprise patch update. Looking back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the 4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.\nLow credibility of text: The RTX 4090 also possesses a higher MSRP than the RTX 3090, which was launched at $1499. This bump of $100 is actually fairly good pricing, considering inflation in the subsequent years, too.  It’s tough to tell what demand might look like for the RTX 4090, but since it will retain Nvidia’s power crown, and will potentially be one of the best graphics cards in 2023. The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.  Due to an oversupply, Nvidia has cut the price of current-generation high-end graphics cards, and the newer RTX 40-series GPUs are priced slightly higher.  The RTX 4090 manages to boast incredibly impressive specifications on paper, with even more impressive results in gaming scenarios like in Overwatch 2. We’ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You’ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia’s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM. Nvidia released further information on performance that you can expect out of Overwatch 2 using the GPU, we’ve listed their results below.\nHigh credibility of text: The RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn’t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you’ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC’d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you’re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS. However, months after launch, prices for board partner GPUs are beginning to ease toward MSRP. Despite this, it’s still priced lower than we initially expected, as a Vietnamese retailer listed the new GPU for over $2000. However, it’s thankfully lower.\nLow credibility of text: Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.\n\nQuestion:What is the price of RTX 4090 GPU?\nAnswer:"

The dramatic score and intense dialogue set up a feeling of triumph through adversity, and it looks as if Sweetwater may just be one of the most feel-good movies hitting theaters this Spring. Every good biopic has a strong and often inspiring central character, and Sweetwater is no different. Born in Arkansas in October 1922, Nat Clifton, nicknamed \"Sweetwater\" because of his love for fizzy drinks, showed his true talent for basketball throughout his time in school. After serving in the US Army during World War II, Clifton made it back safely and began his career in professional basketball. As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd. In 2014, some 24 years after his death, Clifton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, perfectly summarizing his incredible career.\nLow credibility of text: Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner.  Sports biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance.

Julian Chokkattu nearly a decade after Google launched its Android Wear smartwatch platform—now called Wear—a Google-made watch is finally here. It's called the Pixel Watch. The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.  There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8. Speaking of Apple, these Pixel Watches lack any sort of iPhone compatibility. Google's taking a page from Apple and limiting the Pixel Watch for use with Android phones only. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. The Pixel Watch comes in black, silver, or gold.\nLow credibility of text: 17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.\nLow credibility of text: 65] Nicole Nguyen of The Wall Street Journal did not find the smartwatch particularly astounding and noted several software bugs, but ultimately deemed it a worthy companion to the Pixel phone.[66]  Analyst firm Canalys calculated that Google shipped an estimated 880,000 Pixel Watches during the fourth quarter of 2022, constituting 22 percent of Google's total wearable sales, which include Fitbit products. The Pixel Watch's launch allowed Google to obtain 8 percent of the wearable market share, jumping 16 percent from fourth place to second place, behind Apple.[67] The Pixel Watch Android app had amassed more than 500,000 downloads by February 2023.[68]  In May 2023, it was reported that Google was aiming to launch a second-generation Pixel Watch later that year, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.[69]\nHigh credibility of text: The Pixel Watch is a Wear OS smartwatch designed, developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product line. First previewed in May 2022 during the Google I/O keynote, it features a round dome-shaped display as well as heavy integration with Fitbit, which Google acquired in 2021. Two Pixel-branded smartwatches had been in development at Google by July 2016, but they were canceled ahead of their release due to hardware chief Rick Osterloh's concerns that they did not fit well with other Pixel devices. Development on a new Pixel-branded watch began shortly after Google's acquisition of Fitbit.  The Pixel Watch was officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by Google event, and was released in the United States on October 13.  In July 2016, Google was reportedly developing two smartwatches, codenamed \"Swordfish\" and \"Angelfish\", which were to be powered by the Android Wear operating system and expected to be released under the Nexus brand name.[2] According to Business Insider, these watches were canceled ahead of the 2016 Made by Google launch event due to concerns from Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh that they did not sync well with the company's new Pixel devices; the smartwatches were eventually \"salvaged\" by LG and released as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport in February 2017.\nHigh credibility of text: 27][28][29] In an interview with CNET, Park stated that there were no plans to shut down Fitbit, adding that the Google Fit app would co-exist with Fitbit on the Pixel Watch.[30] Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen wearing a Pixel Watch in September during an interview at the Code 2022 conference.[31][32] Google officially announced the Pixel Watch on October 6, alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, at the annual Made by Google event.[33] It became available for pre-orders on the same day, before being released in nine countries on October 13.[34] When asked why Google waited so long before launching the device, Osterloh cited their acquisition of Fitbit and its expansive health platform as the primary catalyst which convinced Google to greenlight the Pixel Watch, adding that the company was committed to first-party wearables.[35]  The Pixel Watch is available in two models, one with and one without support for cellular connectivity.[38] Its case has a diameter of 41 mm (1.6 in) and a Gorilla Glass 5 display. Powered by Samsung's Exynos 9110 SoC alongside the ARM Cortex-M33 co-processor, it contains a 294 mAh battery and 2 GB of RAM, as well as multiple sensors and wireless technologies.[39] The Watch features a USB-C charging mechanism manufactured by Compal Electronics.\n\nQuestion:When did the Google Pixel Watch start sell?\nAnswer:"

And Hidden Heroes started doing it 10 years ago, and it is the key operative motor.”  Tom Hanks Hanks is best known as an actor and director, creating feel-good masterpieces like Big, Toy Story, and That Thing You Do, but also for creating historical epics that chart the stories of our men and women at war, like Saving Private Ryan or the HBO series “Band of Brothers.” Maybe this fascination with the Greatest Generation is what led to his work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and supporting military caregivers as the chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign. Hanks has been candid in saying that it’s way more simple, when Elizabeth Dole asks for your help, you don’t say no.

And it is love that propels mothers and fathers, spouses, siblings, children — to hold them and care for them when they return, with wounds seen, and unseen.” Savannah called out by name specific caregivers she's encountered, like Colleen Rose, who nursed her husband through devastating burn injuries, and Pat Ochan, who cares for her husband and raises their son all while juggling her job and pursuing a Ph.D.\nHigh credibility of text: Washington, DC (October 12, 2022)—The Elizabeth Dole Foundation announced Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of TODAY at NBC News, as the 2022 Tom Hanks Caregiver Champion Award recipient in recognition of her outstanding support of military caregivers.

(The Central Park Conservancy began in 1980.) And with its help, the park has undergone a series of renovation and restoration projects.

I’m honored to be taking on a citywide leadership role in caring for New York City’s most essential resource, its parks and open spaces, and I will continue to cherish and support Prospect Park as a neighbor and park advocate. It has been a great privilege to steward this breathtakingly beautiful space, and serve as only the third president of this thriving, 35-years-young organization.

The streamer added 4.38 million subs in the year-ago quarter, which at the time represented 9.4 percent growth. So we’re not there — but we are well above the company’s tempered expectations; at the end of Q2, Netflix forecasted that it would add 1 million global subscribers in Q3. Clearly, it bested that — the same goes for its financial forecasts. Netflix earned $3.10 per share in the third quarter on $7.926 billion in revenue; its net income was $1.398 billion. Wall Street forecasted earnings of $2.13 per share on $7.84 billion in revenue. Back on July 19, Netflix itself estimated Q3 earnings per share of $2.\nLow credibility of text: This key metric indicates the number of global users that have signed up and paid for a subscription to receive streaming services. Streaming subscriptions are a critical component of Netflix's revenue, and maintaining growth in this area is increasingly difficult with the entry of many competitors in the streaming space. Though this figure beat analyst estimates, it represents a slowdown in membership growth relative to the 9.4% YOY growth in paid memberships for Q3 FY 2021.   Netflix said that the rising U.S. dollar poses a significant headwind for its Q4 FY 2022 and is likely to contribute to $7.8 billion in revenue, a decline sequentially and and an increase YOY. It gave no guidance on EPS. The company also expects membership growth to slow relative to the prior quarter, with an expected 4.5 million paid net adds compared to 8.3 million for Q4 FY 2021. The company said it does not anticipate a material contribution from its advertising business in the upcoming quarter as it will launch midway through Q4 and will grow membership over time.   Netflix shares spiked by 15.1% as of 4:21 p.m. New York time. The stock has vastly underperformed the broader market over the last year, with a 1-year trailing total return of -62.3% against -17.1% for the S&P 500.\n\nQuestion:What is the subscriber growth of Netflix in Q3 2022?\nAnswer:"

Let’s go. First off, NBC revealed that there is an official title for this new episode 4 of Chicago PD’s current season 10.

The season concluded on May 24, 2023. The season contained 22 episodes.   Chicago P.D. revolves around the members of the Intelligence Unit of the 21st District of the Chicago Police Department. The season stars Jason Beghe, Jesse Lee Soffer, Tracy Spiridakos, Marina Squerciati, Patrick John Flueger, LaRoyce Hawkins, Benjamin Levy Aguilar, and Amy Morton. Aguilar joined the series prior to the season premiere, after guest-starring in an episode of the previous season, while Soffer departed the series following the third episode. This season also includes the 200th episode of the series.  Jason Beghe who plays Hank Voight is now credited as an Executive Producer.  The team investigates a string of brutal pharmacy robberies and after Halstead gets into a fight with a suspect, stabbing the man to death, he chooses to turn himself into Chief Patrick O'Neal rather than go along with the cover story Voight and Upton had composed. Halstead later resigns from the Chicago PD, turns in his badge and announces he's returning to the Army to become the leader of a squad designed to track down the worst drug cartel targets, a position that will see him traveling to Bolivia.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of Chicago P.D.

While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months.

At $17.99, buying into the family plan for just two users offered a significant savings over individual accounts. Now, a two-user family will save only $1 a month. For now, however, single-user prices remain the same: $11.99 a month for individual accounts and $6.99 for students.

God of War Ragnarok is official – for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War… so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that’s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

In a blog shared on July 6, Santa Monica Studio shared that pre-orders for the game will begin from July 15. The blog also details several different versions of the game that will be available, including a collector’s edition that comes with a 16″ replica of Thor’s hammer.

At the Sony PlayStation Showcase on September 9, developer Sony Santa Monica and publisher PlayStation Studios announced that God of War Ragnarok has been delayed to 2022.

In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\".\nHigh credibility of text: Oh boy.

Sunak’s only challenger, Penny Mordaunt, leader of the House of Commons and former defence minister, was reportedly backed by 30 MPs compared with nearly 150 supporting Sunak. “This decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,” Mordaunt said in a statement as she withdrew from the race just minutes before the winner was due to be announced. “Rishi has my full support.” Sunak and Mordaunt had lost to Truss last month in the race to appoint a successor to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was forced to announce his resignation in July after a wave of scandals linked to parties held during the COVID-19 lockdown. Sunak will be the UK’s first leader of colour and the first Hindu to take the top job. At 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. The multimillionaire former hedge fund boss will be expected to impose deep spending cuts to try to rebuild the UK’s fiscal reputation, just as the country slides into a recession, dragged down by the surging costs of energy and food. He will also inherit a political party that has fractured along ideological lines, a challenge that damaged the fortunes of several former Conservative leaders.\nLow credibility of text: No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[40] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.  On taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:   His Majesty the King [Her Majesty the Queen] has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.[41] Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3]  In 2010, the prime minister received £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[42] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.  The prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister.\nHigh credibility of text: We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

Considered a centrist and pragmatic politician, he emerged in the latest leadership contest as a safe pair of hands to guide the U.K., after Liz Truss' policy proposals around tax cuts and spending shook the government's credibility and spooked markets.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.\nHigh credibility of text: Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott             Updated on:  October 25, 2022 / 7:49 AM           / CBS News          London — Rishi Sunak became prime minister of the United Kingdom on Tuesday after meeting with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace.

The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan. Users will have access to a 720p video stream — versus the 1080p stream offered by the $15.49 Standard plan and the 4K plan offered by the $19.99 Premium plan — which can be accessed from any internet-connected device.\nHigh credibility of text: When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what’s included? Here’s what you need to know. Updated on July 19, 2023 with details on how “Basic with Ads” is now called “Standard with Ads” following the elimination of the ad-free “Basic” plan. Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, or $8.50 a month less than Netflix’s least expensive ad-free plan. For some context, Paramount+ and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported, versus the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus) each cost $4.99 a month, while ad-supported Hulu costs $6/month. Meanwhile, HBO Max with ads goes for $10 a month, while Disney+ will charge $8 a month for its upcoming “with ads” plan. As it stands, Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plan, Standard, currently costs $15.49 a month for a single stream.

Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023.   \"More than a quarter of our signups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available,\" Greg Peters, Netflix's co-CEO, said in a news release. \"Engagement on our ads plan is similar to our comparable non-ads plans.\"  Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022.

These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs $7 a month.

Amidst the buzz around Season 2, HBO confirmed that the series had been renewed for another season. There haven’t been any details about returning cast members, but based on the Season 2 finale, we can guess that Tanya won’t be among them. While filming has not yet begun, White has teased that he’s interested in exploring \"death and Eastern religion and spirituality.\" Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction.

While season one was filmed exclusively in the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, due to pandemic-related restrictions, for the second season they’ve branched out from the dreamy environs of the hotel to take in some of Sicily’s most beautiful towns and coastal spots, leaving one question on everyone’s lips: just where was The White Lotus filmed? Here’s our guide to all the key filming locations in The White Lotus season 2.  As with the first season, most of the show is centred around the antics of the monied guests staying at an uber luxurious resort – in the first season that was the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii, and for the second season the team chose another Four Seasons resort: the grand San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina. Situated high on the rocks, it offers up splendid views over the Ionian Sea, Mount Etna and an ancient amphitheatre.\n\nQuestion:Where does The White Lotus Season 2 take place\nAnswer:"

If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden’s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren’t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.  Still, dozens of seats are in play, including many of those held by Democrats who won in suburban districts in 2018, winning the majority for the party that year.

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies). Both will affect turnout. Nor do we have any explicit measure of conditions and candidates in specific elections.\nHigh credibility of text: A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.  The Biden White House will also face an onslaught of investigations on a wide range of issues.\nHigh credibility of text: Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. (Oct. 14) WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats have held both chambers of Congress and the presidency for the last two years, but they may not have such consolidated power for much longer.  Republicans are favored to win the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, bolstered by frustration over the economy and advantages in the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years. But Democrats are working to hold their ground, campaigning on maintaining access to abortion and other issues.  The outlook is murkier in the Senate, where Republicans are bidding to take back control. Several races in key battleground states are tight, leading Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to say the chances of his party winning a majority are just 50-50.  A look at control of Congress and what will happen if Republicans win a majority in either chamber in the election:  Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have held the majority since 2018, when they won control in then-President Donald Trump’s first midterm election. Republicans could take back the House if they net just five seats in dozens of competitive districts, and they are trying to win dozens. History also gives Republicans reason for optimism.\n\nQuestion:which party controls the house after 2022 midterm elections?\nAnswer:"

Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates. Among likely Republican voters, 74% said they planned to support Laxalt, compared to 83% for Lombardo and 88% for their Republican House of Representatives candidate.

The BBC announced today that actress Millie Gibson has been cast on the British science fiction show Doctor Who as the titular time-traveler's new companion, or partner-in-adventures, Ruby Sunday. Gibson, 18, will star opposite Ncuti Gatwa, who is playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Gibson will make her debut on the show over the 2023 Christmas season. Her previous credits include the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honored to be cast as the Doctor's companion,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa's side, I just can't wait to get started.\" \"Millie just is the companion,\" said Gatwa. \"She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot wait to sail the universe with Millie!\nLow credibility of text: Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"It’s the great honour of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already. She’s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I’ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that’s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.\nLow credibility of text: Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.\nHigh credibility of text: We've known for a while that Ncuti Gatwa is the next (well, it's a little more complicated than that right now, so spoiler alert for lower down the page) incumbent of the TARDIS, due to debut as the lead in Doctor Who next year. Now we know who will be his first main companion – Coronation Street's Millie Gibson, playing Ruby Sunday. \"Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor’s companion,\" she says. \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get started.\" Ncuti Gatwa adds: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!” Russell T. Davies, who brought the series back in 2005 for its big relaunch, is returning to run it again starting next year.\nLow credibility of text: The 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her “fam,” and in the big finale episode – “The Power of the Doctor” — several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10.

She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.\nLow credibility of text: Lopez topped them all, though, donning three custom dresses from Lauren for her nuptials with Ben Affleck last summer. In hindsight, Neal’s and Biden’s attendance at the designer’s fall fashion show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York may have been a sign of her intentions.  \t           \tThe location of the private affair — the South Lawn — was a first for White House weddings. After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House’s South Portico with Biden’s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden’s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday’s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama’s administration.\nHigh credibility of text: President Biden's granddaughter looked stunning in a long-sleeve gown. Ahead of Naomi Biden's wedding to Peter Neal, speculation over what designer President Biden's granddaughter would pick to design her wedding dress was high.  Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well—as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.  The official social media accounts for President Biden and Dr. Biden tweeted, \"Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you.\" Congratulations Naomi and Peter! We love you. pic.twitter.\nLow credibility of text: Dolan, who published the aptly-named wedding photography book “The Perfect Imperfect” last year, was one of several authors at the nuptials. The bride’s mother debuted “If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction and Healing” in June and her father released his memoir “Beautiful Things” last year.  \tFor the ceremony, the bride wore Tiffany & Co. Victoria earrings and the groom sported a Schlumberger single brooch from the company. Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House. That independent New York-based female-founded brand gained international attention after First Lady Jill Biden wore a blue tweed coat with velvet lapels and a coordinating dress from the previously little-known brand.  \t           \tNaomi Biden’s bridal choices stand to impact future brides, since high-profile weddings routinely create fashion trends and interest in the labels that were worn.\nHigh credibility of text: Photo: Norman Jean Roy Naomi Biden‘s recent nuptials have gone down in history as the first wedding of a grandchild of a sitting US president at the White House. And now, photos exclusive to Vogue reveal that an Arab designer was a major part of the bride’s big day. While she wore a Grace Kelly-inspired wedding gown by American brand Ralph Lauren to exchange vows with Peter Neal, Biden slipped into a sleek dress from Lebanese designer Reem Acra’s namesake label for the reception and cake-cutting ceremony. Photo: Norman Jean Roy The ivory Mikado silk gown created by Beirut-born Acra came with a delicate strapless neckline, and was made notably special with pearls belonging to Biden’s grandmother Roberta Buhle sewn into the sweeping six-foot train. Biden paired the dress with pearl jewelry of her own, and sheer gloves. Acra was also the designer of choice for First Lady Jill Biden, who wore two dresses from the brand on the day: A custom couture silk chiffon vintage blue dress with a teal wool crepe coat for the ceremony and a gold embroidered seafoam blue dress for the black-tie reception.

The Socceroos claimed a 1-0 win over Tunisia to give themselves a shot at the Round of 16 in their group finale. That Australia vs. Denmark match on Wednesday will essentially serve as a playoff for a berth into the knockout rounds.

By Mark McKee | Published 11 months ago  CBS had a relative TV goldmine from 2005 to 2020 when the FBI Behavior Analysis Unit traveled the country, bringing to justice the worst criminals within the borders. Criminal Minds revolutionized the murder mystery on TV with a stellar cast of characters that used their expert talents in human nature to chase after the worst the country had to offer. Spencer Reid, Derek Morgan, Jennifer Jareau, David Rossi, Aaron Hotchner, and Emily Prentiss captivated audiences for a decade and a half before the show came to an end in 2020. Fans didn’t have to wait long for news of a revival, as the team couldn’t stay away from a new series premiering this Fall on Paramount+. The latest iteration of the series has now found its title. Deadline reports the new series will appear under the title Criminal Minds: Evolution.  Just before the pandemic began, fans saw the BAU chase after The Chameleon to close out a series that had to create 15 years of diabolical murderers without allowing it to get stale. The series ended with Spencer Reid in a coma and traversing the memories of agents he worked with in the past.\nHigh credibility of text: Related: Criminal Minds Revival: Will Hotch Return In Season 16? It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn’t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven’t been keeping track of Paramount+’s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen. Overall, despite the series of changes coming the BAU's way, it's all for the better.\nLow credibility of text: Cook (JJ), Kirsten Vangsness (Penelope), Aisha Tyler (Tara), Adam Rodriguez (Luke) and Paget Brewster (Emily).

Gilford’s post-FNL TV credits include L.A.’s Finest, Good Girls and, most recently, Midnight Mass. In officially confirming Criminal Minds‘ comeback back in July, Paramount+ president Nicole Clemens said in a statement, “For 15 seasons, Criminal Minds was at the forefront of cutting-edge scripted drama as it explored the psychology behind crime — thrillingly. The series never stopped evolving during its run, and we are beyond excited to bring it back into a new era with new stories for a new generation of viewers at Paramount+. Erica, the whole cast and creative team are building a season full of new twists that we are sure will electrify audiences.” Longtime Criminal Minds showrunner/EP Erica Messer will be back to oversee the revival, with Breen Frazier and Chris Barbour returning as writers/executive producers.

It’s a shame Matthew Gray Gubler won’t be in it as Dr. Spencer Reid, he was my favourite character. So it will be hard to watch knowing he won’t be in it. But no one person is bigger than any show. From what I’ve read about it so far I’m liking the new format, it will be different and interesting to watch a continuing story all through the season. I’m really looking forward to it. 😊 The character they shouldn’t really bring back is Hotch! The show was never as good with him! Not sure if I will watch. No Michael Gray Gubler, that’s upsetting. It is the 16th season or a new series ?? I am really upset it will be on Paramount plus as I can’t afford more money on our cable bill., as my husband and I are retired.   This was m y favorite show.  Many others are in our situation. I’d love to see MGG in a reboot of the Ellery Queen Mysteries with him in the lead role. I love the show I’ve watched it at least four….. I’m so glad Criminal Minds is coming back! So sorry that the character Spencer won’t be back. We loved his character so much. Without Spencer I hope they bring back Hotch.  I still miss him.  Four women and only 2 men is not fair.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of the new season of \"Criminal Minds\"?\nAnswer:"

An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule’s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He’s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he’s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he’s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN’s “College GameDay” that he grew up “revering” the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. — Sherman He’s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska — which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long.

Rhule will be introduced as the Huskers’ 31st permanent head coach at 1:30 p.m. in the Hawks Championship Center. Fans are invited to gather at Gate 20 on the east side of Memorial Stadium at 12:50 p.m. to welcome Rhule to campus. A special viewing of the press conference will be offered inside Memorial Stadium. Fans can also watch the introduction online. Rhule was announced as the new head coach on Nov. 26 by Trev Alberts, vice chancellor and director of athletics.  The 47-year-old Rhule has built an impressive coaching resume over the past 25 seasons with experience at both the collegiate and professional levels. Rhule has served as a head coach for the past 10 years, including seven seasons in the collegiate ranks and three seasons in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers. Alberts said success as the head coach at Temple and Baylor provides evidence of Rhule's ability to build a program and made him an ideal fit at Nebraska. \"It is a privilege to welcome Coach Matt Rhule, his wife Julie, and their family to Nebraska,\" Alberts said. \"Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program.\nLow credibility of text: His final season at Baylor included 11 regular season wins, a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game and a New Year’s Six Bowl appearance.  Then came a less stellar NFL stint that ended after an 11-27 record in two-and-a-half seasons. It’s unclear what the exact contract details are as the Panthers owe over $40 million in buyout money. It’s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach Mickey Joseph and Nebraska’s assistants.  Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago. The Huskers just wrapped up a 4-8 season and have not had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2016.  But the financial resources, fan support, brand and facilities are in place to be competitive toward the top of the Big Ten. “It is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,” Rhule said in a release. “When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top of the list.  The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. sports@dailynebraskan.com Senior Sports Editor   Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.\nLow credibility of text: \"Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\" Rhule is taking the helm following the firing of Scott Frost and the promotion of Mickey Joseph as interim coach. Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 – the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost’s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn’t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation’s five biggest conferences. Alberts previously said following the announcement of Frost’s firing that expectations may be lower. “We will stop talking about championships or stop talking about things we used to do,” he said.\nHigh credibility of text: New Head Football Coach Matt Rhule, live coverage right now on air @WOWT6News #Huskers pic.twitter.com/rr9eerBvtW Rhule wouldn’t share specific plans about who he might be bringing along with him, but said he would definitely be talking with — and listening to — players, coaches, and staff before making changes. Coming off a big win on Black Friday, Huskers are most interested in hearing about whether Interim Head Coach Mickey Joseph, who took the helm after Scott Frost was fired, would be retained. “I reached out to Mickey right when I got the job. Looking forward to talking to him at some point and talking to the rest of the staff. I’ve been on both sides of it,” Rhule said. “I’ve been an assistant coach on a staff that’s been let go, and I’ve always appreciated the coach coming in and talking to me. So I’ll try to be thorough with that process over the next couple of days.” Alberts said the decision about whether to keep Joseph was entirely in Rhule’s hands. “Ultimately, this is going to be Matt Rhule’s decision,” Alberts said. “He’s the head coach and he needs to hire the 10 assistant head coaches he believes gives him the best opportunity.” Rhule also talked Monday about his affinity for Nebraska. “My son is this YouTube generation.

Have you seen Mandalorian? When they revealed Luke Skywalker, they made use of voice-cloning in that one. They also used a primitive version of TTS in 2001: A Space Odyssey to give HAL a unique voice.

Similar kinds of algorithms are used to analyze and then reproduce existing and create new voices, too. So, the text-to-speech voice on TikTok that you like hearing is actually an AI voice produced by an underlying speech synthesis algorithm that you can’t really meddle with.

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

The retail warehouse giant opted not to raise the cost of a membership even as rival Sam’s Club did. Costco served up some of the cheapest gas prices in town when prices at the pump were sizzling in the summer months. The company was often the last grocer to raise prices on household essentials despite biting price hikes from vendors. To top it off, the Issaquah, Washington based retailer kept the price of its legendary $1.50 hot dog intact and continued to offer employees among the best compensation packages in all of retail. For its efforts, Costco was rewarded with impressive sales gains seemingly every month of the year, a stock price that relatively out-performed the S&P 500 and Yahoo Finance’s coveted “Company of the Year” award. The headlines for online-car buying platform Carvana (CVNA) haven’t been good recently. And whether the company will remain a public entity is now in doubt.  In fact my colleague Rick Newman wrote a column dubbing it Yahoo Finance’s “Worst Company of the Year.” Despite a stock down XX% this year, concerns over its debt load, and weather management has the know-how to right the business, it seems one thing may actually stick around - the trend of buying used cars online.\nLow credibility of text: It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title.

In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above. “It’s about everything you worked for,” Biden said, with union officials standing behind him. “It’s about finding a dignified retirement.” The money for the Central States Pension Fund is the largest amount of federal aid provided for a pension plan, the Biden administration said. It comes from the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that he signed into law in 2021. “This matters,” Biden said. “This matters for workers … This matters for their spouses, this matters for their mothers and fathers who they’re taking care of … It matters for the country.” Many union retirement plans have experienced financial pressure because of underfunding and other issues.\nLow credibility of text: Biden Celebrates $90 Billion Bailout of Private Union Pension Plans \r President Joe Biden jetted off to Cleveland on Wednesday evening to announce the official launch of a $90 billion bailout of union retirement plans—one that's completely paid for with federal borrowing. The bailout was approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to more than 200 nearly insolvent multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. \"With today's actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve,\" Biden told the cheering crowd at a Cleveland high school. Millions of union workers, that is. If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way—even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security looms on the brink of insolvency. Oh, and you'll have to pay back (with interest!) the money borrowed to make this bailout (and the rest of the American Rescue Plan) possible.

Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.\nLow credibility of text: 1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime.

Including their elimination, African teams have fallen in the first round 38 times. However, even when African sides have bowed out early it has rarely been without incident. Some notable highlights have been Zaire reportedly not knowing the rules for a free kick in 1974, Roger Milla dancing by the corner flag in 1990 and South Africa’s Siphiwe Tshabalala’s opening goal in the 2010 tournament — the only one to be held in Africa — resulting in a continent exploding in joy.\nLow credibility of text: Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event.[69] All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).

Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.\nHigh credibility of text: World Cup 13  Morocco have become the first African team to ever make the semi-finals of the World Cup after their sensational victory over Portugal on Saturday.

ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert. Washington State's Kirk Schultz, Baylor's Linda Livingstone and Clemson's Jim Clements are a few of more prominent presidents in the athletics realm.\nLow credibility of text: Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  The first issue for the next NCAA president: What is the association even going to look like for Mark Emmert's successor? That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.  First, history would suggest the NCAA has to lean away from hiring a school president as its next leader.  Dick Schultz (1988-93), the former Virginia president, was run out in scandal.\nHigh credibility of text: The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn’t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA’s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association’s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, “Because it’s worth doing. Yeah, it’s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.“ Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn’t have a background in college athletics or higher education.\nHigh credibility of text: Charlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time.           Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as “going from the frying pan and into the fire.”           “I don’t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that’s the reason I took the job,” said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. “I could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.”           As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions.           On the first day of the men’s basketball tournament, Baker –  who played basketball at Harvard – discussed with CNN’s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers.           And he also told CNN why he thinks there’s so much excitement for March Madness.\nLow credibility of text: Media Center 4/26/2022 6:10:00 PM  Today, NCAA Board of Governors Chair John J. DeGioia announced by mutual agreement with the board that Mark Emmert will be stepping down as president of the NCAA.  He will continue to serve in his role until a new president is selected and in place or until June 30, 2023.   \"Throughout my tenure I've emphasized the need to focus on the experience and priorities of student-athletes,\" said Emmert.  \"I am extremely proud of the work of the Association over the last 12 years and especially pleased with the hard work and dedication of the national office staff here in Indianapolis.\" \"With the significant transitions underway within college sports, the timing of this decision provides the Association with consistent leadership during the coming months plus the opportunity to consider what will be the future role of the president,\" said DeGioia. \"It also allows for the selection and recruitment of the next president without disruption.\" NCAA member schools adopted a new constitution in January and are in the process of transforming the structure and mission to meet future needs. 08.07.23 08.03.23 08.03.23 08.02.23 08.02.23 Thanks for visiting !

Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a new CEO for Twitter, or X Corp. as it’s now called — and it’s a woman. He did not name her but said she will be starting in about six weeks. In February, he told a conference he anticipated finding a CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter “probably toward the end of this year.” (May 11) Elon Musk confirmed that the new CEO for Twitter will be NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, an executive with deep ties to the advertising industry.  “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Musk wrote in a Friday tweet. He added that Yaccarino “will focus primarily on business operations” while Musk will stay closely connected to product design and new technology. Before that announcement, NBCUniversal said Friday that Yaccarino would step down immediately as chairwoman for global advertising and partnerships.  Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it since, has long insisted that he would step down as top executive at the company, which is now called X Corp.  Few expect Musk to remove himself from the decision making process at Twitter, however.  “While he’s stepping back from the CEO title, Musk is far from likely to step back from calling the product shots,” said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester Research.\nLow credibility of text: As broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers their brand messages were not an afterthought. She said NBCUniversal incorporated advertisements in its Peacock streaming service from the outset. “Twitter needs credibility with the advertising community,” said Greg Kahn, chief executive of GK Digital Ventures media consultancy. “Linda has demonstrated her trust, her innovative nature of bringing new partners to the table and a deep bench of relationships.” Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla, completed his purchase of Twitter in October for $44bn. He said in December that he would step aside as CEO once he found “someone foolish enough to take the job”. On Thursday, Musk tweeted that he had found a CEO without naming Yaccarino. One person close to Yaccarino said Musk’s tweet may well have accelerated the timetable for her to join Twitter, which would be a balm to Tesla shareholders. Shares of Tesla were down 1.3 percent on Friday even as analysts commented that a CEO hire would allow Musk to concentrate on the electric car business. Comcast shares were little changed.\nLow credibility of text: 160] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an \"annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million\".[161] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[162] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[163] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[164] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[165] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[166][167] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[168][169]  In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[170] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2 billion in share buybacks.\nLow credibility of text: 152] On October 16, 2008,[153] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[154] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO.

On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and \"be completely focused on product strategy\".[155][156]  According to The New York Times, \"Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship\" when Williams was away.[157] According to PC Magazine, Williams was \"no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company\". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to \"help in any way [he could].\"[158] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[157]  In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[159] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.\nHigh credibility of text: Musk has hired former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino, who modernised the advertisement business at the media firm. Former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino will become Twitter’s new CEO, current chief executive Elon Musk says in a tweet, as the social media platform seeks to reverse a plunge in advertisement revenues. “I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!” Musk said on Friday. “@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.” Yaccarino, who modernised the advertising business at the Comcast Corp entertainment and media division, will have her hands full as she takes on a firm loaded with debt, among other challenges. Since Musk acquired Twitter in October, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 percent of its staff. Musk this year acknowledged that Twitter suffered a massive decline in advertisement revenue. Musk has axed thousands of employees, rushed the launch of a subscription product that allowed scammers to impersonate major brands and suspended users with whom he disagreed. Twitter’s “trajectory will immediately take a 180-degree turn” under Yaccarino’s leadership, said Lou Paskalis, a longtime advertisement industry executive and CEO of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy.\n\nQuestion:who is the ceo of twitter?\nAnswer:"

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

The acclaimed stop-motion/live-action hybrid also scored Annies for Best Voice Acting for co-creator Jenny Slate and Best Writing — Feature (director Dean Fleischer Camp, Slate, Nick Paley, Elisabeth Holm). Although it was a critical favorite and is very well liked, the challenge has been getting it seen by more voters. The other three Oscar nominees are Pixar’s “Turning Red,” DreamWorks’ “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” and Netflix’s “The Sea Beast.” “Pinocchio,” del Toro’s first animated feature, has been the frontrunner from the outset, benefiting from the director’s auteur status.

Guillermo del Toro wins Oscar for best Animated Feature Film for Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio LOS ANGELES -- \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" has had an Oscar wish come true. The director's stop-motion, musical take on the puppet who longs to be a real boy won Netflix its first animated feature trophy on Sunday. The category has primarily gone to either a Walt Disney or Pixar-produced film for the past decade - with the exception of \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" \"Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. We are all ready for it. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" Del Toro said. \"Pinocchio\" was considered the contender to beat. It swept several awards including the Golden Globe and the top honor at the animation industry's Annie Awards. The voice cast includes Ewan McGregor, Christoph Waltz, fellow Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. It earned rave reviews for a stunningly beautiful production that takes a dark look at issues of love and mortality between the titular puppet and surrogate father, Gepetto. A polar opposite of Disney's 1940 version, this \"Pinocchio\" references Catholicism, fascism and the ugliness of war.\nHigh credibility of text: [1/2]Guillermo del Toro accepts the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film for \"Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio\" during the Oscars show at the 95th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 12, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Danielle Broadway LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" won the Academy Award for best animated feature film on Sunday, the third Oscar of his career. The haunting stop-motion musical fantasy was inspired by the 1883 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi, and informed by Gris Grimly's illustrations of the 2002 edition of the book. Del Toro, 58, reimagines the classic story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy, who is cared for by carver Geppetto. However, the story of the Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) film is set in Fascist Italy during the interwar period and World War Two. \"Pinocchio\" prevailed over other popular nominees A24's stop-motion film \"Marcel the Shell With Shoes On\" and the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) 3D animated film \"Turning Red.\" Del Toro has many accolades, including his 2018 Oscar wins for best picture and best director for \"The Shape of Water.\n\nQuestion:What movie won the Oscar for Best Animated Film in 2023?\nAnswer:"

More observations may refine this. pic.twitter.com/FJ5IkTotaV Visualizations of the orbital data for 2022 YG show it taking an odd path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a more circular orbit and stretching out again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats itself.  Watching the asteroid's projected path over a period of a few centuries is oddly hypnotic in this visualization posted to YouTube. Previous \"mini moons\" included asteroids 2020 CD3 and 2006 RH120, but both only stayed for a relatively short time. More observations are needed to refine the apparent orbit of 2022 YG to see if it truly will be with us deep into the next century.  There have been mini-moon false alarms in the recent past. An apparent new tiny satellite spotted in 2020 turned out to be a big hunk of space junk from a 1960s rocket launch instead.\nHigh credibility of text: 2022 YG is a near-Earth asteroid and a potential quasi-satellite of Earth, discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov at Nauchnyi, Crimea on 15 December 2022. It has an estimated diameter of 16–30 meters, given H of 26.6, and an albedo 4-15%.[a]    This near-Earth asteroid-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\nLow credibility of text: Our planet has a strong gravitational connection with the Moon. But sometimes the gravity of the Earth can also capture small asteroids, which then remain for a certain period of time, orbiting us as a kind of temporary moon. This has happened at least twice this century: “mini-moons” have remained in Earth’s orbit for several years or even less. But the newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG has probably been trapped in gravity for several decades. An interesting space rock was first observed on December 15, 2022. Interestingly, one of the first to notice it was amateur astronomer Henadii Borisov from Crimea, also known for the discovery of the first known interstellar comet, which now bears his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it is originally catalogued, has a diameter of 16-30 meters. Early computer models of its orbit showed that it completed a total orbit of the Earth in one year. Moreover, this has been happening since about 1961. The simulation showed that the quasi-moon will continue to orbit the Earth until 2181, when it can finally free itself from the gravity of the Earth. Visualization of the orbital data for the year 2022 YG also shows that it takes a strange path around our planet, stretching into an elongated ellipse in one direction, then migrating back to a rounder orbit and stretching again in the other direction before the whole cycle repeats.\nHigh credibility of text: The space rock looks to have been captured by our planet's gravity over 60 years ago.    An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.  Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.  The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961. Run the simulation into the future, and it looks as though the asteroid will continue to act as a quasi-satellite until 2181 when it may finally break free from Earth's gravitational hold.\n\nQuestion:Who discovered asteroid 2022 YG?\nAnswer:"

Importantly, Microsoft 365 Basic is not replacing the free Microsoft 365 tier. That’s here to stay, along with the same benefits it offers today, including access to the web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, OneDrive, Clipchamp and more, and 5 GB of cloud storage.

Priced at just $1.99 per month, Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to replace the 100GB OneDrive storage option with some extra features that sit in between the free option and the $6.99 a month Personal subscription. Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus / malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. “Later this year, we’ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,” says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge.

From the mind of Zack Snyder comes Rebel Moon — and we’re getting a sneak peek. In an action-packed new teaser that debuted at Netflix’s Tudum: A Global Fan Event, fans finally got a chance to feast their eyes on the visionary auteur’s eagerly awaited new sci-fi fantasy epic. “I thought I knew what a big movie was until I came onto this,” says one of the film’s stars, Ed Skrein, amidst an eye-candy assault of behind-the-scenes footage that includes wild green-screen battles, grueling weapons training and fiery explosions. Front and center in the new featurette are star Sofia Boutella and director Snyder himself, who says that he has been dreaming up the Rebel Moon universe for more than two decades.  The details on the blockbuster are still hush-hush, but here’s what we know: A small peaceful colony on the outskirts of the galaxy is targeted by the insidious Imperium (embodied by a deliciously evil Skrein). But they won’t be facing down the forces of darkness on their own. A team of intrepid warriors will soon come to their aid and turn the tide against the interplanetary interlopers.\nLow credibility of text: A young woman is then sent out to assemble a team of warriors from neighboring planets who can help them fight back. Rebel Moon is clearly a big deal for Netflix, which is on the hunt for more homegrown franchises to line up alongside Stranger Things and The Witcher in the ongoing battle for streaming supremacy. Snyder himself told the Hollywood Reporter, \"my hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.\" On top of the previously mentioned Rebel Moon sequel, Forbes say an RPG videogame may also be on the cards, while extended, R-rated versions of both confirmed Rebel Moon movies are seemingly on the way (via SlashFilm). Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it. Netflix isn't usually in the habit of showing off its wares half a year ahead of release, so it's still a little early for a full Rebel Moon trailer. Nonetheless, we have been treated to a tiny bit of footage courtesy of the streaming platform's 2023 preview. Scan forward to 02:03 on the vid below to watch spaceships, lasers and Djimon Hounsou shouting.\nHigh credibility of text: Editor's Note: This piece was updated on July 9. Rebel Moon will hit Netflix just in time for Christmas on December 22, 2023. This has become a trend for Netflix to release a buzzy title in the days leading up to Christmas. In the past, hit films such as Don't Look Up, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Bird Box, and 6 Underground were released on the service during the holiday season. Rebel Moon will have a limited theatrical release in the weeks before it lands on Netflix. As of right now, it is unknown when that'll be and how many theaters will screen the film. Snyder's previous film with Netflix, Army of the Dead, screened for one week in May 2021 across 600 theaters in the US. Rebel Moon will likely follow a similar route.  There is no trailer for Rebel Moon. That being said the first pieces of footage for the film were released in a sizzle reel for Netflix's 2023 film slate, which you can watch above.

Now, after leaving the DCEU behind, Snyder has teamed up with Netflix for an assortment of projects, including Army of the Dead and the forthcoming Rebel Moon.  The movie has already drawn comparisons to that of the Star Wars franchise and is shaping up to be one of 2023’s hottest blockbusters, and a major holiday hit for the streaming platform. So, if you’re like us, you’ll want to be updated with all things Rebel Moon. Here’s everything you need to know.  Rebel Moon will premiere on Netflix on December 22, 2023. The two-part space epic began filming on April 19, 2022, and wrapped on December 2.  Filmed back-to-back, Zack Snyder’s foray into space warfare will also be released in theaters for a limited time. Initially, the early concept for the film was pitched as an Akira Kurosawa-inspired adventure to Star Wars executives during the prequel era, but ultimately transformed into the Netflix space opera we know today.\nLow credibility of text: Everything you need to know about Zack Snyder's new sci-fi movie franchise for Netflix. by Tigran Asatryan  Published on January 18th, 2023, 8:00 am EST Picture: Netflix Zack Snyder is teaming up with Netflix to produce and direct two major sci-fi movies: Rebel Moon Part 1 and Part 2.

The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.

Babylon, which was released in theaters on Dec. 23, 2022, came to the streaming platform on Feb. 21, 2023 — about two months after its debut. If Scream VI follows the same trajectory, we could be watching it from the comfort of our homes by mid-May 2023. Viewers are saying that they want to view the new horror movie Scream 6 on Hulu. Unfortunately, this is not possible since Hulu currently does not offer any of the free episodes of this series streaming at this time. It will be exclusive to the MTV channel, which you get by subscribing to cable or satellite TV services. You will not be able to watch it on Hulu or any other free streaming service. The Scream franchise debuted in 1996, with a screenplay by Kevin Williamson (then best-known for creating Dawson’s Creek) and director Wes Craven, a lifelong horror fan who created the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The film was a huge commercial and critical success, bringing in almost $200 million at the box office worldwide, while helping to revive the “slasher film” genre (just see all the other horror films that were made after the success of Scream). The opening scene with Drew Barrymore remains one of the most memorable — and most-spoofed — scenes today.\n\nQuestion:When does Scream VI release?\nAnswer:"

Under the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged, CBO projects that real GDP will grow by 3.1 percent in 2022 (as measured from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022). That expansion is driven by strong growth in consumer spending and real business investment and by a shrinking U.S. trade deficit (see Table 2-2). The growth of real GDP declines steadily through 2024, led by slower growth in consumer spending and investment, before remaining almost constant through 2026.

This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.\nLow credibility of text: “In addition to the third party services we’ve used, we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak. We collectively call this logic the ‘director,’ as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole,” Hartle said via email. “It’s worth mentioning that we don’t generate the artwork or the laugh track — those are precanned assets, but we have ideas on how to do that in the future.”  Hartle told Polygon that the look mimicked the era of ’90s point-and-click games that came out around the same time as Seinfeld. “We thought it worked well with the overall vibe of the show and lended itself to the strange/eeriness, too, but the big goal was to have it be thematically relevant,” Hartle said over email.  This AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesn’t really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.  One popular clip actually has decent dialogue. It’s titled, “Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit.\nLow credibility of text: The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI’s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying.\nHigh credibility of text: The surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it’s never really gone away – it’s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the “story” – if you can call it that – of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, “we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak,” Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. “We collectively call this logic the ‘director’, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole.\nHigh credibility of text: Jerry Seinfeld, trapped in algorithmically generated limbo Seinfeld was famously described as \"a show about nothing,\" and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre, AI-generated Seinfeld episode has been streaming on Twitch for a full month, titled “Infinite Nothing.” The never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much “about nothing,” as algorithmically animated Seinfeld characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model, with minimal human moderation. In an interview with Vice, Skyler Hartle, the co-creator of “Nothing, Forever,” explained the thinking behind the project: “The actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project,” Hartle said. “But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.” “Aside from the artwork and the laugh track you'll hear, everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music,” one of the creators wrote in a Reddit comment.\n\nQuestion:What is the title of the AI-generated episode of Seinfeld?\nAnswer:"

As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.\nLow credibility of text: The Iowa Senate passed SF 2369, and Democratic Rep.

Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.  “If the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” Konfrst said in the press release.  SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice.\n\nQuestion:What is the voucher amount per student in the Students First Act?\nAnswer:"

These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It’s an AI chatbot, and it’s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn’t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn’t officially replaced Google Assistant, it’s a far more powerful AI assistant. That’s because it’s based on Google’s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI “learn” natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public.\nHigh credibility of text: Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine.

We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. Right now, our professional users are using the platform for concepting.\nLow credibility of text: As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.\nLow credibility of text: He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.\n\nQuestion:who founded midjourney?\nAnswer:"

Microsoft announced a new version of its search engine Bing is integrating artificial intelligence chat in a step the tech giant hopes will bolster its place in the online search business (Feb. 7) (AP Video: Manuel Valdes) REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft’s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology.  Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. “Think of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful” than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview. A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge.\nLow credibility of text: Microsoft Bing (commonly known as Bing) is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.  Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called \"Explore pane\") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.[4]  In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search.[5] Yahoo! finished the transition in 2012.[6]  In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as \"Tiger\", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.\n\nQuestion:What technology has Microsoft incorporated into the new Bing?\nAnswer:"

Ready is joining Pinterest from Google, where he served as President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users and oversaw Google’s vision, strategy and the delivery of its commerce products. Prior to Google, Ready served in various senior leadership roles at PayPal, including Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.   With over 400 million monthly active users, Pinterest has built a healthy advertising business that generated strong cash flow and doubled revenue during the pandemic. In addition, Pinterest has been laser-focused on putting Pinners first, continuously improving its roadmap, investing in creators, shopping and scaling internationally.   “Building Pinterest with such a wildly talented, kind and creative team has been the gift of a lifetime,” said Silbermann. “Today, Pinterest inspires hundreds of millions of people with ideas for every aspect of their lives. We’ve built a growing global business that puts the well-being of our users at the core of everything we do. And we’re just getting started.”\nHigh credibility of text: Today Pinterest announced that co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, Ben Silbermann will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman, and online commerce expert Bill Ready will become Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective June 29, 2022. See Press Release Here.  Ben sent an email to employees at Pinterest, which we are sharing below: From: Ben Date: Tuesday, June 28, 2022 Title: Help me welcome our new CEO, Bill Ready Dear Team,  After more than a decade running Pinterest, I’ve decided to move into a new role, Executive Chairman. While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I’m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision.    One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.  I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story. Over time, I decided he would be an outstanding CEO for our next chapter. Our board of directors met him and felt the same way.\nLow credibility of text: The co-founder will stick around as Pinterest’s first executive chairman. Curiously, PayPal was reportedly looking into buying Pinterest back in October 2021. Days later, the payments firm squashed the “rumor” in a note to investors, saying it was “not pursuing an acquisition” at that time.\nLow credibility of text: Most recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo.  At his core, Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it.  As you can imagine, this was a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways. That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm.  I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days.  When we started Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited minutes!\nLow credibility of text: Silbermann continued, “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments. And he shares our passion for creating a positive corner of the Internet. I’m confident he’s going to be an outstanding CEO.”   “On behalf of the Board, I am thrilled to welcome Bill to the Pinterest team,” said Andrea Wishom, Pinterest Board Lead Independent Director. “Bill is a proven leader, whose experience in payments, product development, and shopping uniquely positions him to take Pinterest to its next phase of growth. It is a testament to the remarkable vision and leadership of Ben that we are able to welcome Bill, who shares similar values. The Board and I look forward to working with them both to accelerate Pinterest's strategy of bringing everyone the inspiration to create the life they love.”   “There’s no better time to join Pinterest,” said Ready. \"I have long admired the brand and platform that Ben and the Pinterest team have created and everything the Company stands for. I am excited to build on that foundation to further scale the Company’s ecosystem and drive increased value for shareholders. Having built multiple businesses from zero and operated at the scale of billions of users, I have a deep appreciation for what it takes to scale a business like this to the next level.\n\nQuestion:Who is the new CEO of Pinterest?\nAnswer:"

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn’t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once.

The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles.

That's the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. And it announced yesterday it will cut another 10,000 jobs. This follows 11,000 layoffs at Meta last November. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that 2023 will be Meta's, quote, \"year of efficiency.\" He also says it will be, in his words, stronger and more nimble. We're joined now by Wall Street Journal technology reporter Sam Schechner. Sam, thanks for coming on.SAM SCHECHNER: A pleasure to be here.PFEIFFER: These are a lot of layoffs, but I want to make sure we put it in the overall context of how large Meta is. So tell us, how many employees does it have now? How many will it have left once the layoffs are done?SCHECHNER: Well, those are good questions. We know the numerator. We don't necessarily know the denominator. At the end of the year, Meta had roughly 86,000 employees. Most of those who are being laid off - the 11,000 from last fall - were still on the payroll, the company said.\nHigh credibility of text: Meta has started another round of layoffs amid the company’s “year of efficiency.” The latest job cuts are the third round of a series of cuts first announced in March. The company said it expected to shed a total of 10,000 jobs over the course of three rounds. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are impacted by the latest round, but the layoffs, once again, seem to be primarily in non-engineering roles. People in marketing, communications, and recruiting have lost their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited posts on LinkedIn. Meta will also be slashing nearly 500 jobs from its Irish office, about 20 percent of its workforce in the country, according to a separate report. Meta declined to comment on the cuts. A spokesperson pointed to a memo Mark Zuckerberg shared with employees last fall when the company conducted an earlier round of 11,000 layoffs. In the message, he said that economic conditions had “caused our revenue to be much lower” than expected. He described  the job cuts as “some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history” and “what we need going forward.” Zuckerberg has talked openly about the need for more “efficiency” in the months since. He  dubbed 2023 as Meta’s “year of efficiency,” and said he wants to create a “flatter” management structure at the company.\nLow credibility of text: So if we're going by that and we add it together - you know, 21,000 people being let go - that could be nearly a quarter of Meta's workforce.

In a letter to staff posted to the corporate website, he cited a decline in e-commerce, the wider economic downturn, increased competition, and a decline in ad sales–the primary way the company makes money.   \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" he wrote.  The layoffs come as the company has invested billions in the so-called metaverse, pitched as a virtual-reality future in which people will work, mingle, exercise and go to concerts.

I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” Amazon will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including iRobot’s net debt.

According to a document iRobot filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, it also was the second time Amazon tried to buy the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner and other household robots. The new information reveals more background on how Amazon, which already has a large robotics presence in Massachusetts, scooped up one of the area’s oldest and most influential robotics firms. Amazon first tried to buy iRobot in the fall of 2016, the filing said, but iRobot’s board of directors determined the offer “undervalued” the company at $60.50 per share. In the coming months, iRobot’s stock price increased, and Amazon ended its acquisition discussions. Advertisement The next time Amazon expressed interest in buying iRobot was on May 16 of this year, when an Amazon representative called Colin Angle, cofounder and chief executive of the company. Amazon proposed acquiring iRobot for $64 per share in cash about a month later. Again, iRobot believed Amazon’s offer undervalued the company. On June 29, iRobot issued a counteroffer to Amazon, asking for $70 per share. On the same day, iRobot told Amazon that it anticipated a second-quarter earnings miss. This meant iRobot also planned to lower its revenue projection for the year.\nLow credibility of text: , regulatory and tax regimes under which iRobot operates; (xvi) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect iRobot’s financial performance; (xvii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact iRobot’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xviii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as iRobot’s response to any of the aforementioned factors.

The game was played on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It was the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the third at this venue, with the most recent previously being Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 (then known as University of Phoenix Stadium).[6]  Both teams finished the regular season with a league-best 14–3 record. This was the Eagles fourth Super Bowl appearance overall and the second in the last six seasons, having previously won Super Bowl LII; the Eagles previously lost Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. This was the Chiefs' fifth Super Bowl appearance overall and third in the last four seasons, having previously won Super Bowls IV and LIV, and losses in Super Bowls I and LV.  After the Eagles went into halftime up 24–14, the Chiefs mounted a comeback to win the game 38–35 with a game-winning field goal kicked by Harrison Butker.

The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas.

Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable?

Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.\n\nQuestion:who trained LLaMA?\nAnswer:"

The organizers said they wanted the space to feel mellow, like walking on a beach at sunset, according to a report from The New York Times. Is it throwing everyone off their fashion game?

By Gabe Cohn The 95th Academy Awards were held Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the proudly weird sci-fi movie from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, swept most of the top categories, including best picture and directing. Michelle Yeoh, that movie’s star, won the best actress award, becoming the first Asian actress ever to win that honor. The other lead acting prize went to Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”), also a first-time winner. (Perhaps the biggest winner of all: A24, the studio behind both of those movies.) Earlier victories went to “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won for best animated feature; Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, each first-time winners for supporting roles in “Everything Everywhere All at Once”; “Navalny,” which picked up the best documentary feature statuette; the costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who became the first Black woman to have won two Oscars (this time for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”); “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which won several awards in the first half of the show, including for best international feature, production design and cinematography; and Sarah Polley, who won the best adapted screenplay honor for “Women Talking.” See below for a full list of winners.\nLow credibility of text: Lead-actress nominee Michelle Yeoh is up against Tár powerhouse Cate Blanchett, among others, and the film’s directors, Daniels, are up against the likes of Steven Spielberg. But this could be one of those years in which one film dominates the night. If you’re looking for an overarching theme from tonight’s Academy Awards, Jamie Lee Curtis’ best supporting actress win portends a big one: This is already gearing up to be an enormous night for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Curtis’ win — against, among others, co-star Stephanie Hsu, with whom she was splitting votes — suggests a deep well of support for the film, which was already leading the Oscars field with 11 nominations.  By Stephen Thompson Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, an ambitious stop-motion retelling of the classic children’s story, won best animated feature at Sunday’s Academy Awards. It’s the third Oscar for del Toro, who won twice for The Shape of Water in 2018.

By Bob Mondello No matter who takes home the gold statuettes tonight, 2023 will be remembered as a watershed year for Asian actors at the Oscars. Four Oscar nominations for Asian performers in a single year is a record. Three of them – Michelle Yeoh, who is competing for best actress, Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) and Stephanie Hsu (best supporting actress) – play the laundromat-owning multiverse-hopping family in Everything Everywhere All at Once. Also in the supporting actress category is Hong Chau, who plays the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale. While there are also Asian directors and screenwriters among this year’s nominees, in other respects, 2023 represents a step back from diversity for the Motion Picture Academy. With no Black actors nominated for lead performances and no women feature directors nominated, there are still areas of the multiverse that need exploring.

The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk’s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app.\nHigh credibility of text: Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks with presenter Xenia Wicket at the Offshore Northern Seas 2022 (ONS) ... [+] meeting in Stavanger, Norway on August 29, 2022. (Photo by CARINA JOHANSEN/NTB/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk has formed a new AI company in Nevada called X.AI Corp., according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. Musk is listed as the director of the company and Jared Birchall, widely considered to be Musk’s right-hand man behind the scenes, is listed as the company’s secretary. Musk publicly called for a six-month pause in the development of artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but that hasn’t stopped Musk from going full steam ahead in developing his own AI. Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015 but left the company after a power struggle in 2018. Musk has made some big hires from the world of artificial intelligence lately, including Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss, according to a reporter earlier this week from Insider. Babuschkin was hired away from DeepMind, the AI arm of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It was assumed last month that Musk was going to work on AI under the umbrella of Twitter, a company he purchased in October 2022, but it’s now clear he wants to develop AI with this new independent company in Nevada.

Matt Gentry/AP Virginia Tech quarterback Devin Farrell, right, is stopped from behind by linebacker George Ballance during the team's spring game Saturday in Blacksburg.  BLACKSBURG — Once last year’s football season came to an end, Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said the plan in his second year with the Hokies was to upgrade the talent level in the offensive skill positions. Saturday’s spring football game at Lane Stadium was the first time Virginia Tech’s fans got a good glimpse of where things are at in that category. And while some of those new faces may not have been in the spotlight, their impact was evident in what the Hokies were getting out of some of their returning wide receivers and running backs. There was progress, Pry said, although most of that was only seen on the Maroon side of the football.\nHigh credibility of text: Filed under: It’s the middle of April, the big Hokie Hi weekend has passed, and the biggest of the big campus celebration events was the Spring Football Game.  There were lots of things to look at and analyze but for now, here are some shots and comments from the game.  GO HOKIES!!! The crowd was easily over 20,000 people.  Hokie Hi weekend featured Friday and Saturday celebrations with an evening tribute to the fallen 32 from April 16th 2007.  The morning on Saturday was the 3.2 mile Run and Walk for Remembrance, and the crowd there was estimated to be 15,000 or so.  The weather in Blacksburg not only cooperated, it assisted by being comfortably warm, without being hot, and a light breeze was blowing.  It was a magnificent way to honor the fallen and celebrate their memories as Hokies.   The Maroon Squad Offense was obviously mostly #1s int he depth chart, with Grant Wells starting at Maroon Squad QB.  He’d remain there for the first half.   We’ll talk about the various observations in a coming article, but overall, he did well and seemed like he was much more comfortable than he was last season.  We’ll take that as a major plus, for now.\nLow credibility of text: Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry reacts after a West Virginia touchdown, as Chamarri Conner (25) returns to the sideline during the second half of an NCAA college football game Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022, in Blacksburg, Va.

The game will be broadcasted on ACCNX. The Hokies finished 2022 with an overall record of 3-8, going 1-6 in conference play. Heading into his second year at the helm, head coach Brent Pry added seven new mid-year transfers and signed the ACC’s sixth-best recruiting class. Former Springfield Central QB Will Watson III will make his collegiate debut in front of fans during the game.  The Hokies freshman quarterback enrolled at the school in January, participated in off-season workouts and has been a regular participant in spring practices.

What TV channel will it be on? - Saturday’s game will kick off at 3:00 p.m. EST on TV via ACC Network.\nLow credibility of text: The Virginia Tech Hokies wrapped up their Spring portion of the off-season with the 2023 Annual Spring Game. The spectacle filled Lane Stadium to half capacity and was televised by the ACC Network. It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday:  1. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance.\nHigh credibility of text: 9 yards per carry for the Maroon squad, running through some decent holes produced by most of the first-team offensive line. “To me, that’s the one area that we had to improve in,” Pry said. “We have to be able to run the football. It really helps everything else. With our offense, with our defense. If we can run the ball, that to me is 100-level foundational stuff. And we’re getting better there. “I think we’ve got a pretty good group up front on defense. We’ve got some old heads at d-tackle that have got some weight on them, can press gaps and do things, and we were still able to get some movement on them guys. So it’s a work in progress, but again, I think the O-line’s improved, I think the running backs are better. I like what’s happening in that room. Still got a ways to go.”         Nice write up on the game and the team. Enjoyed it. thanks Mid-May should be interesting to see who hits the portal. kinda smh as to why qb’s didn’t get a chance to run with 1’s/maroon at least for a series… kinda disservice to drones for sure Soooo….I didn’t get to watch the game.  Did Grant Wells really have 3 kickoffs?  😲 Those duplicate numbers mess up the stat guys sometimes.\n\nQuestion:Who won the Virginia Tech spring game 2023?\nAnswer:"

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.\nHigh credibility of text: These new retail locations mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.

The iPhone-maker’s first retail stores in India have been long-anticipated, but the limited market for high-end smartphones and laptops in the country has tempered Apple’s expansion efforts. Despite being the world’s second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced below $250.

The company also said that the board has recognised Pichai's \"strong performance\" as CEO and added that the vesting of a significant portion of the award would depend on Alphabet's total shareholder return relative to other S&P 100 companies. Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. said the award was tweaked to increase the performance stock units (PSUs) to 60 per cent from 43 per cent in 2019, while increasing the performance requirement for the payout. According to Reuters, Pichai, who is given an equity award every three years, was granted two tranches of PSUs with a target value of $63 million each and was also given a grant of $84 million in the form of Alphabet's restricted stock units. As per a filing from 2020, Google disclosed Pichai's annual salary to be at $2 million. According to the IIFL Hurun India Rich List 2022, Pichai's net worth fell 20 per cent to Rs 5,300 crore, but he ranks amongst the top ten richest professional managers on the list. Before that, in 2018, Pichai turned down a similar fresh grant of stock options, saying he was already paid “generously”.\nHigh credibility of text: Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s 2022 Compensation Valued at $226 Million Listen (2 min) Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s 2022 Compensation Valued at $226 Million Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

In Prima Facie, written by Suzie Miller and directed by Justin Martin, Comer plays Tessa, a young, ambitious lawyer who defends individuals accused of sexual assault and then goes through the legal system herself as a victim of rape. While accepting her Tony Award on stage, Comer acknowledged the responsibility she feels in taking on the role.   \t“To every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been the greatest honor and it continues to be,” she said.  \tThe play marks Comer’s Broadway debut. The Killing Eve actress played the role on the West End, where she made her professional stage debut and won an Olivier Award for her performance, for a run that began in April 2022. After being with the role for more than a year, Comer told The Hollywood Reporter that she feels changed by the experience.   \t“I feel like I have so much more trust within myself and who I am. I realized that I was quite fearful last year of a lot of things, especially in my ability to do this.\nLow credibility of text: I mean, that's astonishing when you think about it.\" \"Prima Facie\" is a demanding, draining one-woman show. Comer is alone on the stage for more than an hour-and-a-half.  Moriarty asked Comer, \"This is your first time on Broadway, first time on a London stage – and you pick this play?\"  \"How do you not?\" Comer replied. \"I was like, 'I have no idea how I'm going to execute this or how I'm gonna get to a place of being confident and comfortable enough to do this, never mind, like, once, but, like, eight shows a week.' But I was so excited by that journey. Like, if I didn't take this, another actress is going to, and I'm gonna hate myself for the rest of my life!\" Comer had to research the part of a barrister, which is the British equivalent of an American trial lawyer. But she had no trouble playing a scrappy young woman from Liverpool (a blue-collar town north of London) who defies expectations. Liverpool is where Comer also grew up. \"I'm definitely scrappy,\" she laughed. \"Yeah, there's a lot of me in her, for sure.\" Comer said her parents and younger brother never doubted she'd succeed as a professional actor, even without formal training. \"They were just, like, if you're gonna commit, commit.\nHigh credibility of text: By          Megan Lim       ,          Courtney Dorning       ,          Juana Summers       NPR's Juana Summers talks with actress Jodie Comer about the Broadway premiere of her play Prima Facie. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Jodie Comer - American audiences probably know her as Villanelle, the beautiful, chameleon-like assassin on \"Killing Eve\"...(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"KILLING EVE\")JODIE COMER: (As Villainelle) I did my first ever kill in this country here - strangled a high-ranking police officer. He was a tango champion.SUMMERS: ...Or as Millie and her avatar Molotov Girl in the movie \"Free Guy.\" Now Comer is also a Tony Award winner. She won best actress at last night's ceremony for \"Prima Facie.\" The one-woman show is in the final weeks of a Broadway run after selling out in London's West End last year. It is the story of Tessa, a lawyer who successfully represents men accused of sexual assault.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMER: (As Tessa) The only way the system works is because we all play our roles. My role is defense. The prosecutor prosecutes. We each tell a story, and the jury decide which story is the one they believe. They take the responsibility.\nLow credibility of text: And I said, 'Well, she's Russian. Why would we cast a Russian actor in a story, a British story?' And they went, 'She's not Russian. She's British. She's from Liverpool!' And so, her and I laugh about that quite often now. I think, 'You know, you did such a good job, you nearly did yourself out of this job!'\" In \"Prima Facie,\" Comer plays Tessa Ensler, a young, scrappy British barrister from a working-class background who has no problem defending male sex offenders … that is, until she herself is assaulted by one of her male colleagues.  When Comer's character goes to court and tries to explain why she didn't fight off her attacker, many in the audience seem to relate, and audibly sob.  Miller said she wasn't expecting the audience's tears, which have happened at every performance. Miller, who worked as a human rights lawyer in Australia, and still lives there, said she wrote \"Prima Facie\" (a legal term that means self-evident) to highlight just how much the British and American justice systems fail women who bring sexual assault cases. \"The statistics speak for themselves,\" Miller said. \"One in 10 women actually reports a sexual assault. Out of those, I think it's one in 10 that go to court. And out of those, there's a 1.3% conviction rate.\nHigh credibility of text: And I think that actually, through this experience, I’ve been able to transform that into a sense of trust, which is a really nice feeling,” she said.   \tThe Broadway production is lead produced by James Bierman of Empire Street Productions. Bierman noted the production was able to recoup while also offering lower-priced tickets, including $10 lottery tickets and $45 rush tickets throughout the run.  \t           \t“Bringing Prima Facie to Broadway has been a journey of responsibility and faith that has been met with a response that we only dared to dream of when we set out. Suzie Miller’s urgent play, Justin Martin’s forensic direction, and our design team’s visceral production have been the backdrop for Jodie Comer’s extraordinary performance as Tessa Ensler, and the way that audiences have embraced all of this has been truly humbling,” Bierman said.   \tA film adaptation of Prima Facie is in the works, with Cynthia Erivo set to star and executive produce.

After receiving a couple of matches, he turned, out of curiosity, to a new AI dating tool called Rizz to break the ice. “There’s some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message [on a dating app],” Lloyd said. “It’s like getting started on a term paper.” Rizz, which is meant to function as a digital wingman, helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches. The company behind it is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting opportunity to connect with someone new. Additionally, the world is becoming more automated: Email messages auto-complete, subscription services auto-renew, and any product under the sun is a single click away.\nLow credibility of text: ” Green said she tweaked some suggested messages to show her own personality, but the AI brought out a side of her that she usually does not show. Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.\nHigh credibility of text: We've officially entered a new circle of online dating hell. Meet Rizz, which according to its App Store profile is an AI-powered \"dating assistant\" that tells Tinder, Hinge, and otherwise dating app users what to say to their online matches. It connects directly to a user's keyboard for easy access, and once installed, all you really have to do is start swiping right — then, from there, just let the bot dictate your every word. Cool. We hate it here. \"There's some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message,\" Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor and Rizz user, told The Washington Post. \"It's like getting started on a term paper.\" And Rizz isn't the only app like this out there. As WaPo notes, a few other apps, including one called YourMove.ai, are currently on the market, while a number of dating app scoundrels have taken to the internet in recent months to tout the supposed dating app prowess of ChatGPT. \"This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,\" YourMove.ai founder Dmitri Mirakyan told WaPo. \"So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt. It turns out it could. A month later, I built the first version [of the platform].\nLow credibility of text: Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. \"There's such a gap currently,\" he told the newspaper, \"in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across.\" That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity? That's starting to sound like The Sims — and as humans, maybe we should shoot a little higher.

The role has been vacant since Earnie Stewart departed last month. In 2019, it was essentially created for Stewart, who extended his responsibilities beyond the U.S. men's national team, to all of U.S. Soccer's national teams and even to the sport's broader American ecosystem. But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job — which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said — into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said.

Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.

Grand Crew stars Echo Kellum as Noah Koles, a hopeless romantic, Nicole Byer as Nicky Koles, a realtor and Noah’s sister, Justin Cunningham as Wyatt Fields, the crew’s married friend, Aaron Jennings as Anthony Holmes, an accountant and also a vegan. Carl Tart as Sherm Jones, a journeyman and Anthony’s roommate, and Grasie Mercedes as Fay, the “new-to-the-crew” member who works at the crew’s hangout. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the show has received positive reviews and the good news is it has even been renewed for a second season as it was announced in May 2022. As of now, there’s no word on when Grand Crew will return.\nLow credibility of text: It’s currently on a hiatus and it’s also hard to say when the new season will come back to the NBC as the premiere date hasn’t even yet been confirmed yet online. We’re hopeful that Grand Crew season 2 is currently shooting and the premiere date will be sometime in early 2023. Its regular time slot is 8:30 p.m. EST on Tuesdays. The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn’t a drastic last-minute change to the 2022-2023 lineup. Other shows to watch out for include American Auto, Young Rock, Quantam Leap, La Brea, and New Amsterdam. And for those of you who haven’t met the crew yet, what are you waiting for? This group of millennials will have you laughing all night long.

Since it premiered within a week of Abbott Elementary in December of 2021, it’s the show I’ve been telling everyone and their cousin to catch up on once they’re up to date with Janine and her fellow Philly teachers. I’ve even gone long on it here in Paste’s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series’ press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn’t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew’s now Fay-less Season 3 future—or even if, indeed, it’s likely to see such a future—it was nevertheless a delight. Enjoy the conversation, and then get back to streaming Season 2! The world deserves as much Grand Crew as Jackson (and NBC) are willing to make.  Note: The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Paste Magazine: So I am really loving Season 2.  Phil Augusta Jackson: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.\nHigh credibility of text: Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive show news, updates, and more! The gang left us with some pretty interesting cliffhangers.

Keep reading on for an official recap of the Grand Crew Season 2 finale. In \"Wine & Journals,\" we learned that following the directive of his therapist, Noah (Echo Kellum) began keeping a personal journal. And by the finale, he tells Sherm (Carl Tart) that it's begun to turn into a screenplay rather than a typical diary. At the end of the episode, we see that he's printed it out with the title, A Hopeless Romantic...and the Friends That Gave Him Hope. Could Noah be on the road to getting a book deal and becoming a published author? Towards the end of the season Wyatt (Justin Cunningham) and Kristen (Maya Lynn Robinson) took in his young niece-cousin, Nadine, when her mother was going through a hard time.\n\nQuestion:When did Grand Crew Season 2 end?\nAnswer:"

Many of the Pixel components — from camera, battery, speakers and haptics technology — were cleverly redesigned to fit within the thin design. Our custom-built hinge not only contributes to that thinness, but also doubles as the most durable hinge out there.2 And last but not least, Pixel Fold has an IPX8 rating for water resistance.

The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn’t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn’t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we’ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It’ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have “the most durable hinge on a foldable,” along with a price that’s over $1,700. Samsung’s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799.

Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case. The phone is available in a dark Obsidian and a light Porcelain colorway.\nHigh credibility of text: The Pixel Fold is available for pre-order from today (May 10), with general sales in June. Incredibly, as of late May, the top 512GB Pixel Fold model is already sold out in the US. If you pre-order the Pixel Fold, Google will also toss in a free Pixel Watch, although this promotion is limited to Germany, the UK, and the US (leaving Japan in the lurch). Otherwise, everyone also gets a 2TB Google One plan for six months and a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium. There’s also a trade-in program for those who want to switch their current handset for the foldable. Google accepts products from Apple, LG, Motorola, OnePlus, and Samsung, and the trade-in’s value differs between the various models. Notably, you can also trade in Google Pixels. For instance, the 128GB Pixel 7 Pro will get you $380 off the Fold’s price. Visit Google’s trade-in portal for the full list of products and offers. The Pixel Fold hasn’t made its mass market debut yet, so you won’t find expert reviews of the foldable.

Google may well develop more standout tricks for the Fold down the road — we know the company is working on an “interpreter mode” for Google Translate that uses both screens for in-person translations — but it feels like a lot of the same in a new package for now. What it is: a new, midrange smartphone How much does it cost? $499 What does it promise? Google’s most thoughtful software features, on a budget. With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7, kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though, this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more expensive devices offered.\nHigh credibility of text: What it is: Google’s first smartphone that folds in half, arriving next month How much does it cost? $1,799 to start What does it promise? A great camera and a design that means it’s easier to use (or tuck into a pocket) when closed More than a quarter of smartphone owners in the United States are “highly likely” to upgrade to a foldable model next, according to a survey conducted by Counterpoint Research. That leaves Google — long an also-ran in the U.S. smartphone market — with an opportunity. And thankfully, the company’s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn’t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it’s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that’s not the case here. It doesn’t hurt that the Pixel Fold is noticeably thinner than other Samsung options, either. At last: a folding smartphone that won’t feel super awkward in your back pocket. When open, the Fold’s internal 7.\nLow credibility of text: 6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes — it’s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less. And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical failure over time.

But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.\nHigh credibility of text: Alphabet Inc.’s Google introduced a $1,799 foldable smartphone, a new entry-level Pixel phone and a tablet for the home, its latest attempt to spark hardware sales in an arena saturated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Launched at Wednesday’s Google I/O conference, the Pixel Fold is Google’s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its 2022 flagship phone’s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.  The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google’s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung’s latest Galaxy Z Fold 4 and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables — with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC — having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's foldable smartphone?\nAnswer:"

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.\nLow credibility of text: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.\nLow credibility of text: Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.\nHigh credibility of text: By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in much more significant ways. While it’s clear that this tool isn’t flawless — and there remains no firm release date for it — Google’s end goal is clear: to make perfecting photos as easy as just tapping or dragging something on your screen.\nLow credibility of text: Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool?\nAnswer:"

As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says “hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps” will automatically work that way.

Apple plans to charge $3,499 for the Vision Pro when it launches in 2024, but the company wants to create a model that has a lower cost to broaden the appeal of the device. Apple engineers plan to use more affordable components to bring the price down, but the lower-priced headset will have the same general AR/VR \"mixed reality\" functionality of the Vision Pro. The chips in the device will be on par with the iPhone rather than the Mac-level chips used in the first AR/VR headset, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. As of right now, development on the more affordable headset is in the early stages and Apple has not created a working prototype. Foxconn is already working on a lower-cost headset, and rumors right now suggest it could come in late 2025 at the earliest.  According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the second-generation Vision Pro will be available in both high-end and low-end models, similar to the iPhone.

The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask—including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses—necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.\nLow credibility of text: Apple did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. The Vision Pro is Apple’s much anticipated foray into virtual reality and its launch could be as important to the company as its other major products like the iPhone. It is billed as a mixed reality headset that blends the virtual and real world—one can switch between full virtual reality and “augmented” reality mixing virtual and real elements—and has been a poorly kept secret that has been years in the making. Investors hope it will fire up interest in the sector, which has been around for years but struggled to take off in a major way. Its high price tag puts it at the upper end of the market—it is working on a cheaper model—which analysts expect will limit initial demand to loyal Apple fans and wealthier customers. The headset’s design and high costs of the technology it uses have reportedly forced Apple to lower its ambitions for the device’s rollout to manage manufacturing difficulties. The issues have reportedly pushed the company to drop its 2024 production goal from more than 1 million units to fewer than 400,000. Apple will push Vision Pro into other markets toward the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg.

A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.\nLow credibility of text: According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to announce its first headset as soon as January next year, with potential features including two 4K micro-OLED displays, 15 optical modules, two main processors, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, eye tracking, object tracking, and hand gesture controls.

N602 is reportedly the successor to the first Apple Reality Pro headset and could come in at a lower price point. N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time. Gurman's latest report is the first concrete indication of what Apple's first headset product could be called.

Apple’s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything’s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release.

At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading.\n\nQuestion:What is the name of Apple's headset?\nAnswer:"

Kate Ryder: Thank you so much for having me. Thrilled to be here in Aspen. So I founded Maven in 2014 because I saw firsthand a lot of the gaps in the in the women’s and family health care model. And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren’t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we’re also the richest country that spends the most on health care. And so you know, what Maven does is we really fill in all of these very distinct gaps through a virtual care and financial support platform. So we have the largest telehealth network and women’s and family health.\nLow credibility of text: Ryder recently told CNBC that the company saw a 67% month-over-month increase in opportunities from companies looking for travel benefits, as well as other health-care support for pregnant women, after the SCOTUS decision. \"Because we're in the market, because we had a platform that we were able to access, we were able to jump up and step up with our products,\" Ryder said at the recent CNBC Work Summit.  Maven Clinic has experienced a broader increase in demand for its products over the past two years amid a pandemic and tight labor market, which she attributed to the accessibility of its virtual platform as well as its outspoken support of health equity. \"The overturning of Roe v. Wade created additional inequities in a system already riddled with them, in a country where 50% of counties don't have an OB-GYN and where maternal mortality rates surpass those of all other developed countries,\" she wrote in the blog post. Maven now reaches 15 million members, a 5x increase from last year, across its 450-plus corporate clients and payers (insurance companies) in over 175 countries, and the platform supports over 30 provider specialties in 30 provider languages.

The round, led by General Catalyst and with CVS Health Ventures, Intermountain Healthcare's VC arm and European venture firm La Famiglia participating, brings Maven's total capital raised to $300 million. Maven reached unicorn status last August in a $110 million round right before the bottom dropped out of the tech sector. While the downturn in tech is forcing down rounds for some startups, Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder said in a blog post the latest deal raised its valuation, albeit slightly, to $1.35 billion.

Ryder has said in the past that her determination to create Maven came partially as a result of her own medical frustration and trauma. A miscarriage left her feeling \"lost, discouraged, and confused why something so painful and physically taxing was considered outside the bounds of traditional healthcare,\" she wrote in a blog post. With the new funding, Ryder said the company needs to be careful about how it scales, but will not be conservative with the cash despite the current economic environment given the need to invest in growth opportunities. \"We're not putting this capital aside for a rainy day,\" she wrote on Monday. Global family benefits growth and Medicaid are two areas that Maven is prioritizing with the new funding. The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform. Additional Medicaid expansion requires \"a more localized approach, which must be more deliberate,\" Ryder said, \"but particularly in the aftermath of Roe, the need has never been greater.\" The Maven CEO laid out some more of her strategic thinking after the fundraise in a series of Twitter posts.

(AP Photo/Matt York) LOS ANGELES (AP) — In the city of stars, Wyndham Clark had his own script in mind in the U.S. Open. In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf’s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother — “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.\nLow credibility of text: Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Los Angeles Country Club will host a major for the first time ever when the 2023 U.S. Open begins on Thursday.

We’re waiting to see what these deals entail, but we anticipate seeing discounts on everything from robot vacuums and smart TVs  to exercise equipment and small appliances.\nLow credibility of text: 12.  Now we do not yet have confirmation that Amazon will have another Early Access Sale this year. But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale — and there's no reason to think it won't — you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.  If you missed out on the latest Prime Day, fear not, because retailers likes Walmart and Target have started their own sales to rival Prime Day. And those deals are still for the taking.

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nQuestion:What is the start date of Prime Day 2023?\nAnswer:"
